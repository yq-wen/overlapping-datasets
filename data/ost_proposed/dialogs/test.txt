new world order ? __eou__ cabal of villains ? __eou__ do you really think that i 'm responsible for these burglaries ? __eou__ we 're saying you seemed nervous about the tape getting out . __eou__ so why don't you tell us what happened at the meeting ? __eou__ that 's privileged information for members only . __eou__ they pay me to keep secrets . __eou__ you 're on a fishing trip . __eou__ and we usually hook a big one , so let 's not waste time here . __eou__ i can subpoena geo 's records . __eou__ 
i got news for you , kel . __eou__ that 's not the only way they can tell it 's a girl . __eou__ you are so disgusting . __eou__ see you at home , kiddo . __eou__ welcome to the world . __eou__ she 's ungrateful . __eou__ she 's deceitful . __eou__ she 's irrational . __eou__ what we 've got here is a manipulative little girl who is spoiled rotten to the core . __eou__ i can't listen to this anymore . __eou__ honey , i don't blame you . __eou__ if anything , i blame myself . __eou__ all those years , she was daddy 's little bunny fish . __eou__ whatever brenda want , brenda got . __eou__ kisses and hugs . __eou__ no questions asked . __eou__ no wonder she has no respect for parental authority . __eou__ she 's out of control . __eou__ out of control . __eou__ no , jim , she is in perfect control . __eou__ and she 's been ever since you decided to go to war with dylan mckay . __eou__ are you forgetting how many times she has blatantly lied to us in the last six weeks ? __eou__ of course not . __eou__ 
at the very least , __eou__ i 'll get an air mattress for the bathroom floor . __eou__ agreed . __eou__ let 's not make a big deal of this . __eou__ let 's just ... kiss and say good-bye . __eou__

thank you , friend . __eou__ there 's not as much as last time . __eou__ yeah , can't really control that though . __eou__ 
she 's a very strong willed girl . __eou__ and professor gunnell has given me an ultimatum . __eou__ either she goes or he goes . __eou__ you know he 's an old bluffer . __eou__ who the hell is going to take professor __eou__ gunnell edinburgh threw him out , remember ? __eou__ i cannot take the risk . __eou__ 
and , anna , the kicker is what he was doing was breaking the law . __eou__ it was a federal offense to do what your great-great-grandfather did . __eou__ but great thinkers ... __eou__ 
jesus , he walked right in there like an idiot . __eou__ let 's hide over here . __eou__ yeah . __eou__

a typical job for servants was to remove night soil from bedrooms in the morning . __eou__ now , the chamber pots could be full to brimming . __eou__ i 'm simulating that now . __eou__ there are limits to authenticity . __eou__ then these chamber pots ... __eou__ ugh , i put my finger in it , how disgusting . __eou__ then the servant had to remove the full chamber pot from the house with great discretion . __eou__ they could use this secret , virtually hidden service staircase . __eou__ ooh ! __eou__ now this is going to be something of a challenge . __eou__ oh , no , i 've spilt some . __eou__ presume that 's a sackable offence . __eou__ now , it would sting , wouldn't it ? __eou__ this is so small . __eou__ 'course , i 'm rather bigger , i suppose , than the 17th century servant . __eou__ it 's now called pages ' staircases . __eou__ people assume only little boys would run up and down . __eou__ might be the case . __eou__ but i expect servant girls as well , carrying chamber pots brimming with human waste . __eou__ oh , dear ! __eou__ oh , dear , this is ... __eou__ this is terrible . __eou__ not doing very well . __eou__

thank you , roberto . __eou__ your honor ... there were three charges ... of impeachment brought against me . __eou__ none of them could be proved . __eou__ they all knew that . __eou__ kennedy 's hit man , john doar ... __eou__ and he had a hundred bloodhounds working for him . __eou__ they told him ... __eou__ and we have ways of knowing this , your honor ... __eou__ they told him , ' there is no case against the president , period . ' __eou__ your honor , the impeachment process itself was ... simply the grandest cover-up of all . __eou__ there can only be one ... __eou__ 
we 're calling it pattern 17 . __eou__ now , the dna proves that one perp matching our new york m.o. __eou__ committed three rapes in five weeks __eou__ down in atlanta in 2008 . __eou__ the brainiacs had the pattern and didn't even know it . __eou__ they didn't even look for six years . __eou__ any matches in codis ? __eou__ nothing . __eou__ not even familial . __eou__ dna does show that he 's a white male __eou__ of european descent . __eou__ which is fairly useless . __eou__ you 're checking matching m.o.s in other states ? __eou__ yeah , hey may have struck in vegas , possibly milwaukee . __eou__ you get dna from those cases ? __eou__ milwaukee has a backlog about a mile long , __eou__ and las vegas doesn't know __eou__ if they 've even tested the kits or not . __eou__ what worries us is , this guy goes on sprees . __eou__ and he 's in the middle of one right now . __eou__ you talk to the vics in atlanta ? __eou__ just one , and she said that he likes to sing church songs __eou__ and that he may have used a pager . __eou__ sounds like a cost-effective trip . __eou__ look , we 've got this , chief . __eou__ it 's just legwork . __eou__ try to put some shine on it before tomorrow . __eou__ what 's tomorrow ? __eou__ the compstat briefing on the pattern 17 rapist . __eou__ you 're in the hot seat , sergeant . __eou__ see , that ... __eou__ that 's why i never took the sergeant 's exam . __eou__ 
i 'll get the check . __eou__ good . __eou__ 
so , carm , how you doing ? __eou__ i 'm okay . __eou__ my lawyer , he 's a top guy ... __eou__ robert greenberg . __eou__ he says that new jersey has this equitable distribution law . __eou__ so apparently 20 years entitles me to at least half his money . __eou__ well , it should . __eou__ you made tony a home , you raised his children . __eou__ does this guy know how to get it ? __eou__ well , it 's mostly cash , obviously . __eou__ god , all those years and you could get nothing . __eou__ this other lawyer , dan minditch says that we should play hardball . __eou__ you know , go after the real assets . __eou__ marriage is beautiful in the beginning , but two , three years later ? __eou__ you 'd think there 'd be some romance at least . __eou__ janice , you 're a newlywed . __eou__ i know . __eou__ six months and bobby still hasn't found my rosebud . __eou__ maybe he should hire a reporter . __eou__ so the movie 's over and they all start talking about their marriages and how miserable they are . __eou__ bitterness . __eou__ so besides the movie night ? __eou__ you have kids ? __eou__ no . __eou__ so did you attend carmine lupertazzi 's funeral ? __eou__ i didn't know him . __eou__ movie night was fun , though . __eou__ who was there at the tony blundetto homecoming ? __eou__ i told you , just family . __eou__ god , is that all you think about is your fucking work ? __eou__ you don't care how i feel about anything . __eou__ 
get in , get in , get in . __eou__ peter , what are you doing ? __eou__ i gotta stop them here . __eou__ oh , no . __eou__ peter , don't do this ! __eou__ peter ! __eou__ no ! __eou__ no ! __eou__ oh , jesus ! __eou__ don't ! __eou__ no ! __eou__

we should reclaim the word geek , like they did with queer . __eou__ i think it 's fine . __eou__ i 'm proud to be a geek . __eou__ i think we 're all geeks . __eou__ yeah ... __eou__ you can get girl geeks as well . __eou__ i don't know if you know that . __eou__ i wonder whether simon thinks ... that tim is a geek . __eou__ he 's quite attractive , isn't he ? __eou__ he 's a bit too , sort of , smooth to be a geek . __eou__ but i think what makes him a geek is his nihilistic , slightly depressive qualities . __eou__ i think that saves him from not being a geek . __eou__ the phantom menace was 18 months ago , tim ! __eou__ i know , bilbo . __eou__ it just still hurts ! __eou__ that kid wanted a jar jar doll . __eou__ kids like jar jar ! __eou__ why ? __eou__

of a right step , and i 'm taking 10 of those . __eou__ so that 's where this number came from , this .001 . __eou__ that 's what the binomial distribution tells us . __eou__ and then this one similarly , is 10 factorial over 1 factorial over 10 minus 1 factorial . __eou__ that 's how i get that one . __eou__ and once again , if you click on the actual cell you 'll see that explained . __eou__ we 've done this multiple times . __eou__ this is just a bionomial calculation . __eou__ then right here , after this line right here , you can almost ignore it . __eou__ i did that so that i can do a bunch of different scenarios . __eou__ 
what 's the point ? __eou__ i 'm falling to bits anyway . __eou__ do you know what you are ? __eou__ a miserable old bugger . __eou__ apart from that . __eou__ what ? __eou__ you 're the stuff every district nurse 's dreams are made of . __eou__ you 're a complete project . __eou__ am i ? __eou__ we fight over patients like you . __eou__ a project , eh ? __eou__ i like a project . __eou__ do you ? __eou__ why 's that ? __eou__ because i was an engineer . __eou__ what did that involve ? __eou__ making things . __eou__ aeroplanes mostly . __eou__ you can make aeroplanes ? __eou__ i can make anything out of anything . __eou__ when i come back will you let me in ? __eou__ i haven't had a woman in the house since 1977 . __eou__ what happened to her ? __eou__ she 's buried under the floorboards . __eou__ 
i don't know . __eou__ let me see the phone . __eou__ 
it 's that thing where your life flashes before you . __eou__ am i dying ? __eou__ but is it really fine ? __eou__ ... to die at this kind of moment ? __eou__ it doesn't matter . __eou__ even if i die on my own ... __eou__ it 's not such a big deal . __eou__

worth 250,000 ! __eou__ now arrange for me to leave . __eou__ the police van is waiting for both of you downstairs . __eou__ you had left ... __eou__ but good you returned ! __eou__ arrest him ! __eou__ he 's the man who was running with these diamonds ! __eou__ keep your diamonds ! __eou__ you stole them ! __eou__ am i right , sir ? __eou__ quiet ! __eou__ i 've heard everything . __eou__ hand the diamonds over to me . __eou__ also the money . __eou__ stealing is a crime . __eou__ helping a robber is a crime . __eou__ buying stolen goods is a crime . __eou__ now you 'll grind grain in jail . __eou__ forgive me . __eou__ i can do nothing . __eou__ come on . __eou__ but we can do something for you . __eou__ free us and keep the diamonds . __eou__ to top it all ... __eou__ if he can give a thief like you 10000 ... __eou__ such a great police officer ... __eou__ i mean ... __eou__ yes ! __eou__ take 1 5000 but spare me ! __eou__ are you trying to bribe me ? __eou__ it 's not a bribe , it 's for your children ; buy them some sweets . __eou__ cakes , pastries ... __eou__ you shut up ! __eou__ you don't even know how to talk to big officers ! __eou__ here 's another 5000 . __eou__ that makes it 1 5000 . __eou__ and spare me , sir . __eou__ 
most people can be trusted to shrug off our presence , but tyler ford isn't most people . __eou__ we identified him as a possible middleman and that makes him a danger . __eou__ when people like he start asking questions , __eou__ sometimes we have to take measures . __eou__ define measures . __eou__ a local reporter once asked too many questions about our parameters . __eou__ days later he received a lucrative offer from a tv station in another town . __eou__ that doesn't sound so bad . __eou__ in greenland . __eou__ i told young tyler to scram . __eou__ you made the cute boy go bye bye ? __eou__ he didn't get his memory back . __eou__ found our address in his appointment book . __eou__ wanted help piecing together his missing two days . __eou__ you could have let me talk to him . __eou__ if he doesn't remember anything , what 's the harm ? __eou__ ida did right . __eou__

there . __eou__ we have them again . __eou__ 
now i come back to find their backs broken , their hope shattered . __eou__ everywhere i go i see fear and suspicion haunting their faces . __eou__ and yet everywhere __eou__ i hear one name . __eou__ even from the mouths of children . __eou__ one name , whispered in hope . __eou__ one name that keeps the flame of england burning . __eou__
