","they cover the gamut .
"
"he would act in the same way a bear would when they were surprised .
","why he did this is only known to him .
"
"the line between bear and human has apparently always been respected by the native communities of alaska .
","we visited the curator of kodiak ' s alutiiq museum , which had recently been raided by tourists out of control .

"
"i was his employee .
","i was the person that figured all the last minute details out .
"
"for treadwell , who had a natural tendency towards chaos ,
","grizzly people served as his organized platform , and jewel was his most trusted co combatant .
"
"i ' il make it big for ya .
","i ' il make it really big .

","only timmy is the boss of all foxes and all bears .

"in nearly 100 hours of his video , she appears exactly two times .
","here disembarking from the plane in the year of her death .
"
"i ' m never going to .
","and you must never look at the photos i ' ve seen at the coroner ' s office .
"
"this has been to alaska many times .
","i ' m sure he loved it to the end , you know ?
"
"and it was a family name .
","i know he got on

","he had this prince valiant haircut .
"
"i guess that ' s when he came up with where he was from and his delightful accent .

"
"i beat your fucking asses !
","i protected the animals !
"
"he ' d always come back .
","and i was kind of his confidante here .
"
"as usual , the expedition was over by the end of september , and both had returned to kodiak on their way back to california .
","treadwell writes in his diary that at the airport he had an altercation with an obese airline agent over the validity of his ticket .
"
"how much i hate the people ' s world , `` he writes .
","and disgusted , he decides right then to return to this spot and his bears .
"
"my camp is unseen .
","it is the most dangerous camping , the most dangerous living in the history of the world by any human being .
"
"the expedition coming close to a close , but i ' m still here .
","it ' s been over four months in the wilderness .
"
"and that , for me , beyond his mission , gives meaning to his life and to his death .
","now the longhorns are gone
"
"and the lion is gone
","and the red wolf is gone and treadwell is gone
"
"well , he cursed all the roads and the old mule
","and he cursed the automobile
"
"because that ' s how it is .
","that doesn ' t necessarily make it less exciting .
"
"whether others approve of what i ' m doing .
","the greatest defeat is when others think you ' re doing things wrong .

","he was someone i admired because of his perseverance .
"
"i will press them to give absolutely all they can .
","you can often do much more than you think .
"
"why the hell did he go down there first ?
","the first day is just as intense for me as for the riders .

","there are no barricades .

"because he knew he was dangerous .
","ivan was the one he had to watch out for .
"
"i know you haven ' t achieved what you set out to do .
","life ' s not over when your career ' s over .

"as a child , he had seen his father murdered in the forum .
","crassus had risen from the ashes of his family ' s defeat . to unlimited wealth and ambition .
"
"the same thing as you , i would imagine .

","you must ' ve known they ' d follow us here .
"
"we will attack first .
","david , hold your men outside the camp until you hear my cry . and then charge in like the gods of hell .
"

","you can tell us now .
"
"our scouts indicate that the slave army . is headed toward the alps .
","but what message does that send . to the hundreds of thousands of slaves in the republic .

","you ' re richer than any roman . and far more generous .
"
"he ' s out there . somewhere , as we speak .
","the slaves took over a fort barely ten miles from here .
"
"he is a contaminating parasite .
","and he crawls from limb to limb . and organ to organ . until the great body of this republic . has been brought to its knees .
"
"and why would you conclude that ?
","because it ' s all he can do .
"
"and while crassus was distracted by the flaming livestock . the army of spartacus climbed the walls and escaped .
","i ' d have paid a lot to see crassus ' face when he found that out .
"
"spartacus will defeat them both .
","to the south , crassus follows close .
"
