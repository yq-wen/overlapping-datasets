A few of our friends from Europe have also suggested that we participate in joint enterprise with them dealing in some of our goods . We think there are a lot of details to go into . "
 Oh no ! Evaluations ! You can tell that's not my favorite job ; I haven't even started yet . When is the deadline for turning in thecompleted forms ? ," Well , you do still have three weeks .

" I think that , as more people use the Internet for both work and pleasure , it makes more sense as a tool to connect with people , and the stigma of meeting someone online is reduced .

 I ’ ll sign for dinner and charge it to our room.Let ’ s see.The bill is one hundred dollars . That seems reasonable . How much tip should I leave ? ," Remember last month when we were in Europe ? Maybe Californians use that same system they add the waiter or waitress into the bill , so you don ’ t have to leave anything extra . "
" Well , I am up to my neck in work . I've got to finish this report . Sarah needs it by noon . I don't want to be scolded if I can ’ t finish my work by the deadline . "," I understand that , but you'd feel better if you took a break , even for just a short while . "

" The first problem is supposed to be solved after the investigation . About the second problem , I admit it's our fault , so we will exchange all merchandise that falls short of our sample . ", Well . I hope there won't be such things . 
 Sure you have to be patient . But I think it ’ s much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls . , But there must be so many people who also see the advertisement for that job on the net . You might have no chance . 
" yes , employees can take up to 10 days of sick leave per year . However , in order to get paid , you ’ ll have to bring in a note from the doctor ’ s . ", even if I ’ m only sick for one day ?

" I know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus . After all , it's a sport . But do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty , polled air on the road ? "," Well , such things are just unavoidable in a great metropolis like Beijing . I think a still more desirable benefit is psychological . Bicycling home after work can help release your stress . Life in the offices is miserable . You just sit there in a daze , gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents . Why don't you give a full play to your energy after work ? Enjoy the speed on the road . Just think , you are flashing past the poles with your own energy . How great ! "
 I was fooled once . A lady told me she needed some money to keep the pot boiling . So I gave her some money and bailed her out of the situation . But later I learned that she had lied to me . , You are still wet behind the ears . You should have seen through her .

"," You're right.He ' s a hard worker , easy to get along with , honest , and he never steals the credit on projects.The only thing he's lacking in is experience . "
" I don ' t think so . I don't think people are going to like it if they have to pay to come . But we certainly can cut costs in other ways , such as make the party BYOB . ", BYOB ? What's that ? 
" You are right , I guess.The world keeps changing , and so do families . But I like a small-sized or medium-sized family where everybody is equal to everybody else . That's what I want . "," It is good to have goals in life . If California doesn't work out , come and visit me in Korea , OK ? "
" We could take a cut on the price if your order is a large one , but a 20 % reduction is really more than we can do . What quantity are you going to order from us then ? "," As a trial order , I'll take 5,000 dozen this time . "
I've read your resume and know a lot of things about your qualifications for this position . One thing you didn't mention is why you left your last job ?

" What we usually do is find a suitable car dealer for you , who offer the type of car that you need . If it's a family car that you want , we have a very reliable dealer already contracted to us . "," Then I can go to this appointed dealer , see what they've got and then make a decision ? "
" That's fine . If you are travelling outside of Mainland China , Hong Kong and Macao we need to follow the SAFE rules . This means that you can exchange 2,000 USD or equivalent . ", That sounds fine . I'll bring in my passport and everything tomorrow . Thanks . 
" As far as a trial order is concerned , the quantity is by no means small . And generally speaking , we like to profit from a trial order . I hope you ’ ll be able to meet our requirements . "," Well , as this is the first deal between us , we agree to give you an one-percent discount as a special encouragement . "
" I know you have done a lot , but you always sleep very late . Sleeping eight hours a day doesn't mean it is healthy . Sleeping after 12 is hurtful to our body , and I think this is your problem . ", I wasn't aware of that ! 
" I am calling to inform you that we're happy to have you with us . Welcome aboard , I'm sure your friend would have given you a lot of information of our school and its motto , ways of teaching , etc . ", Yes . I am very glad to have the chance .

" If they all unite on a certain issue , it's the stockholders who have the final say . You'd think it might be our CEO or the workers , but in fact , the stockholders control the money so they have the most power . ", Is it really that simple ? It doesn't seem very efficient to run things that way ... 
" It might not be the most efficient , but if you think about it , it makes pretty good sense . The stockholders are our investors . They own the capital in our company , so they should have say about what is done with the company . ", I guess I'd buy that ... 
" Well , that top is a little too tight , and those jeans aren ’ t dressy enough . And I don ’ t feel comfortable with that . What do you think , Vicky ? You ’ Ve been very quiet up to now . ", Be confident . Wear styles you ’ re going to be comfortable in . 
 All right . I'm afraid this green dress is too small for me as well . It's smaller than the blue one . I don't like the colour either . It doesn't suit me at all . I think the blue dress is prettier . Co , I'm afraid I haven't got a larger dress . This is the largest dress in the shop .

" Of course . I spent the whole week to know the general process for these plans . And since I was employed , I have been working on them . Madam , how am I doing ? Are you satisfied with my job ? ", How do you feel what you have done ? Did you meet our goals ? 
" Oh . Take it easy . As I ’ Ve said in the interview , once you are employed , we ’ ll give you a probation period of three months . And now we need to sign a draft agreement for the probation period . "," I am sorry , I am just too excited and forget it . Can I look it through ? "
" To be frank , you are not the only one who applies for an agent for us in your country . I'd like to know some ideas of terms on which you would be willing to operate as our agent . "," As we are a well-established company , we are very familiar with the customers ' needs . Besides , we can make full use of our good connections with the wholesalers and retailers here and develop a good market for your products if appointed as your agent . "
" But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency . ", I doubt that .

They will be glad to talk to you . ", Thanks for the advice . I guess you ’ re right . It ’ s just hard to overcome my shyness . I really will try from now on . I promise . 
" You ’ re lucky you start to learn it so easily . I learned English very late , and learned it all by myself . At that time we didn ’ t have a good English studying environment . I have to keep my dictionary on hand . ", Really ?

" Well , as I ’ Ve said , if your order is large enough , we ’ re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent . "," When I say your prices are much too high , I don ’ t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent . "
" To make your offer workable , I think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken . "," That won't do . You see , our profit margin is very narrow . It simply can't stand such a big cut . "
 No.It was very close and they argued over the bid for a long time . Better luck next time . , I knew the delivery was slow but I figured the price would win it for me . 
 Do you have any price range ? Is there any way you can give me any idea of what direction to go or how high is too high ? , We're just looking for a reasonable price according to the specifications in our project blueprint . That's all I can say .

" Can't you give me a break on this ? We've already spent so much money on lighting , I hate to have to blow so much more on halogens . "," No , that's the cost , and that's what it's going to cost us . We can't go in the hole with this . I am giving you my best price , so take it , or leave it . "
" Let's get start . What kinds of things do you have in mind ? If you let us know the requirements you have from the very beginning , we can work through each one until we can come to an agreement . "," Firstly , we'd like to discuss a discounted price . If you can give us a discount of 7 % on the high volumes orders , we can pay in 60 days . "
" Firstly , we'd like to discuss a discounted price . If you can give us a discount of 7 % on the high volumes orders , we can pay in 60 days . "," Huh ... I think 7 % is little high that might be hard to do . How about this ? We'll give you a discount of 4 % , but you can have 90 days credits . "
