Acknowledgments play a necessary part in the interview . __eou__ Sure . Kind acknowledgments can show one's good attainment . __eou__ We often ignore the acknowledgments in our daily life , and consider them as disposable . __eou__ Actually , that's not true . Acknowledgments can help you leave a good impression on others , especially in the public places . __eou__ We should particularly pay attention to acknowledgments in the interview . __eou__ In the beginning of the interview , it is best that you make acknowledgments for the opportunity of the interview . __eou__ Don't forget to say " Thank you " when you take a seat . __eou__ Make acknowledgments as well when the interviewer thinks highly of your dressing , experience , or words . __eou__ You can win a good impression of the interviewer in this way . __eou__ Acknowledgments can also help the job-hunters to show their good attainment . __eou__ Finally , at the end of the interview , make acknowledgments to the interviewer again . __eou__ Smiles and kind attitudes are the basics of acknowledgments . __eou__

Could you tell me something about the Mid-Autumn Festival ? I find it also very interesting . __eou__ OK . It falls on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month . It is said that there is a beautiful goddess Chang'E on the moon who had eaten some sort of elixir and had to depart her husband . She is always expecting to see her husband again . So , later we have the traditional idea that when there is the full moon , it is time for the family members to come together . __eou__ So , I understand why people eat moon cakes on that day . __eou__ You are right . In China , ' round ' is an auspicious word . The moon cakes are in round shape . __eou__ Is it official ? __eou__ It was not in the past . But from 2008 , we can enjoy a three-day holiday for this festival . __eou__
Hey , Jeff , where's your stereo ? __eou__ I needed some money , so I hocked it last week . __eou__ You must have been really hurting for cash to have done that . __eou__ I had just enough money to make ends meet until payday . Then last Wednesday I received a phone bill to the tune of $ 195.00 . I hit the ceiling when I saw that . __eou__ It sounds like you weren't expecting that . __eou__ I'd forgotten that my brother had used my phone earlier this month to call his girlfriend . He forgot to mention that she happened to be in New York at the time 3000 miles away . __eou__ Well , if you need some money to tide you over until payday , I can loan you some . __eou__ Thanks , but tomorrow's payday I can make until then . Thanks any-way . __eou__
I heard a rumor this morning ... It seems Trusten Tools is going out of business.Another competitor is going bankrupt.That could be good news for us . __eou__ I think you must have heard wrong.The truth is we are going to be taken over by Trusten.We are being bought out , and our company will be merging with our largest competitor.It ' s not good news at all ... __eou__ What ? We are merging with Trusten ? I never thought that would happen.Will we be getting new owners ?

You are seemingly upset . What's behind you ? __eou__ Arden wants to have a trademark for our new series of products registered . But I have no idea on the registering process . __eou__ That's not as complicated as you suppose . __eou__ Is it so easy ? I never experienced this . Can you tell me something about it ? __eou__ It is known that there is a time limit for trademarks . And we should not have a similar trademark with the one in the same field . __eou__ Based on what you said , does it mean that we can not have a trademark like ' genova ' , right ? __eou__ Correct . And our country follows the priority of use principle . __eou__ Can you tell something about the preparation for the register ? __eou__ Some relative documents will be needed and the fee may be quite dear .

He is really a good boy . __eou__ You can write all his strengths in the recommendation letter . __eou__ What should I write except these ? __eou__ You should also state that you are his class president , so you are qualified to write this recommendation letter __eou__ OK , I will remember . __eou__

Do you need my Bank Book ? __eou__ I'll need your Bank Card , please . Your Bank Book is required for over the counter services ; with the ATM you just need to have your card . __eou__ Let's get started . First , select the service you require .

Are those all your clothes on the couch ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Are they clean ? __eou__ Actually most of them are dirty . I haven't done laundry in a while . I usually wait until I can do it at my parent's house . __eou__ My sister and I usually go to the laundromat down the street . Why don't you go there ? __eou__ I know I should , but that place isn't very convenient . You have to wait for a long time . __eou__ Yes I know . I have to do it every week . Anyway , are you ready to go ? __eou__ No I'm not ready yet . I still have to brush my teeth and wash my face . Can you wait for a few minutes ? __eou__ OK , but please hurry .

Hi , Janice . Our first weekend after being employed is coming . Show me your plan . __eou__ My mom phoned me this morning , and asked me to go back home to have housework chores . __eou__ What are you assigned to do ? __eou__ God knows . Speaking of chores , I would rather do some washing than cooking . __eou__ For me , I think I will iron my shirt and trousers . Actually , weekends tend to be the most hectic day in the whole week . __eou__ I really hope that I could sleep like a log all through two nights . But ... Some one said that weekends are a bit like rainbows ; they look good from a distance but disappear before we get up close to them . __eou__ I couldn't agree more . __eou__

Yeah , depending on when my brother can come in . __eou__ OK . And who are you more like , your mother or your father ? __eou__ I think I have traits of both , actually . I look more like my mother . __eou__

Why couldn ’ t you sleep ? __eou__ You know how it is when you ’ re in a strange country . Everything is new , and you get tired and nervous sometimes . Then you worry about your family , about conditions back home , about your courses , about your money , about everything . I tried to fall asleep but I just had too much on my mind . __eou__ Well , take it easy . Things will look better tomorrow . Maybe you should try exercising or a hot bath to help you relax . __eou__ Anything is worth a try . But right now I really just want to find a quiet place to take a nap . __eou__

Did you hear what happened in the Scott case ? Some of the sensitive material were leaked to the press . Now every newspapers is all over it . __eou__ Oh ... I bet the firm is fuming . Do they know who spilled the beans ? __eou__ I'm sure they have their suspicions ; there were only a few of the senior level layers who were privy to the case details . __eou__ What kind of repercussions will there be for the people who are held responsible ? __eou__ I'm sure there'll be canned ! And there also might be some legal consequences . __eou__ Why would the person who told have problems with the law ? __eou__ Because whoever let the cat out of the bag was breaking client confidentiality . __eou__ I didn't think about that . That's pretty serious . Are there investigators working on finding out who it was ? __eou__ I'm sure management is on top of it . __eou__

But I was over-tired , because I wasn't able to get to sleep for hours . __eou__ What a shame . Why didn't you take a sleeping pill ? __eou__ I don't like them . I used to take them when I had to work overtime , you know . __eou__ How many did you use to take ? __eou__ Three every night . __eou__ Good heavens . Why did you take so many ? __eou__ Because I was under a terrible strain . The doctor saidthey weren't very strong . Anyway , I used to feel awful the next morning . __eou__ I'm sure you did . __eou__ The doctor said I had to be careful . __eou__ He was quite right . __eou__ So I stopped drinking coffee late at night instead . __eou__

I heard a lot about it . Is it really that fun ? __eou__ For me , it's one of those games that are fun to both watch and play . __eou__ Are you a football player ? __eou__ No , I just for fun with my friends . We play two hand touch or flag football . We're too old to play tackle football . __eou__ What is two hand touch and flag football ? __eou__ Instead of tackling somebody , you just have to touch them with two hands , or if it is flag football , grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing . __eou__ I see .

I'm a Taurus , and it says , Mars is in the third house , and is soon to eclipse Venus . I don't know what that means , but then it says , Your charm and drive will win others over to your way of thinking . Remember to be positive . Sounds good to me . __eou__ What about Gemini ? What's the prediction ? __eou__ Since Mercury has crossed paths with Jupiter , your fortunes are falling . Bad luck will follow you today , and you will lose that which you value . Be careful . __eou__ That sounds bad ! I'm really worried , what should I do ? Maybe I should go home and stay in the rest of the day . __eou__ But we have a date tonight ! You can't stay at home because of a stupid horoscope . __eou__
We are through . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Why ? Isn't it obvious ? First you impose way too much on me , and I'm tired away . Second , you stood me up on the Valentine's Day . __eou__ I'm very sorry for that , but I sent you several messages to explain , my mom was seriously ill , and I had to look afer her . __eou__ But I ended up with finding out lady that night , that you were with other girl at cafe near your home . __eou__ That girl was my cousin . __eou__ You've got so many cousins . I called you later that night . But you didn't have the guts to answer the phone . __eou__ I didn't take my cellphone with me at that time . __eou__ I don't buy a story . __eou__ I know you don't hear me right know , please calm down . Anyway , I don't wanna part . I'll drop by tomorrow . __eou__ No , don't , I don't want to see you anymore . Don't ever call me again . __eou__
Is there any way you can cut us a better deal on your wholesale price for this order ? __eou__ We did the best that we could to give you a low price . Did you get our recent estimate ? __eou__ Based on the estimate you gave us , by the time we figure in transportation and other expenses , our profit is short.With the offer you've given me , we're making next to nothing.Can ' t you do any better ? __eou__ I've already given you a discount of 20 % off of our normally charge . If I go any lower , we'll have loss on this project . I really want to work with you on this . But we've already gone as low as we can go . __eou__ I'll be honest with you , our budgeted cost can't exceed more than $ 150 per unit.That is our bottom line . If you can meet that price , you've got the deal.Otherwise ... __eou__ I'll tell you what , I'll go over the number again with our financial team and see what I can do . I can't give you any guarantees . But we can try . __eou__
Hello . Can I help you , ma'am ? __eou__ Yes . Could you tell me how to send some money to someone with an account with a bank in Germany ? __eou__ Well , you can pay by mail , telegraphic or SWIFT transfer . Or you can have a banker's draft and mail it yourself to the beneficiary . __eou__ Which is the best way ? __eou__ It depends on the amount and how fast you want that person to receive the money . A SWIFT transfer is the fastest method but a banker's draft is usually the cheapest . How much do you wanna send ? __eou__ $ 800 . __eou__ Why don't you send it by mail payment order ? __eou__ How long does it take ? __eou__ About a week . __eou__ I don't know . Can I send it more quickly ? __eou__ Sure . You can have a Telegraphic or a SWIFT transfer . __eou__ And how long do those take ? __eou__ Both a Telegraphic Transfer and a SWIFT transfer will normally be credited to the payee's account within three or four working days , depending on whether the beneficiary's bank is among our correspondent banks or we have to route the transfer through a third bank . __eou__ I see . How can I pay by Telegraphic Transfer ? __eou__ You have to fill out this form , ma'am . __eou__
Good morning , madam . Can I help you ? __eou__ I want to buy some cleansing milk . What would you recommend ? __eou__ Your complexion is on the oily side . I suggest you use cleansing gel . __eou__ Anything that can keep my skin clean will do . __eou__ How do you prefer this one ? It cleans thoroughly without striping your natural protective oil . The gentle formula keeps skin soft and healthy . __eou__ Hm ... the smell is too strong , I can't stand it . I'm very sensitive to fragrance . __eou__ We've also got a fragrance-free one , specially designed for sensitive skin . I'm sure you'll like it . __eou__ I'll try that . Do you have facial cream to go with that ? __eou__ Yes , sure . This line of products is fragrance-free . We have a facial mask , moisturizing lotion , eye cream and tonic . __eou__ I'll buy the moisturizing lotion and cleansing gel first . If they suit me , I'll come back for the others later . __eou__ Thank you very much , madam . Here are some samples of our products . Do try them out . __eou__
Who is that guy ? __eou__ It's Clive of course . Where did you come from ? Every girl knows Clive ! __eou__ Really ? He is my type . __eou__ He is everybody's type . __eou__ What position does he play ? __eou__ Shooting guard . The same as Michael Jordan ! __eou__ Oh , I love Michael Jordan . He fills people's lives with great excitement . __eou__ Used to . But now he is too old to play in a fierce game like this . But Kobe is the upcoming superstar now . __eou__ Kobe is a good player but I heard he is a womanizer . __eou__ That is not true . They are just jealous of him ! __eou__ Jordan is a legend , anyway . An idol that no one can replace . I think Clive can make a good professional basketball player . He is not just about muscles he also plays smart . __eou__ You know what , he is also an outstanding football player . He is surely to be a star of tomorrow . __eou__ By the way , do you know if he has a girl friend ? __eou__ You are so not here ! His girlfriend is one of the cheer leaders . __eou__ Oh , My chance is slim then . __eou__
Have you heard anything about Markweed Inc . ? They have called me back for interview , and I'm considering taking a job with them . __eou__ Well , to start with , Markweed Inc . has a reputation for being one of the best employers in the field . __eou__ The best ... huh ? With so many companies out there , how did they establish themselves in such a solid position on top ? __eou__ First of all , they have an excellent benefits package for all employees , even the maintenance staff have health and dental coverage . __eou__ Really ? What about the pay rate ? Are the wages pretty high ? __eou__ From what I hear , they are very reasonable . A lot of the prestige the company has built is because they have attacked some high profile employees with their incentives . __eou__ Well , what about the work environment ? Not every one is motivated solely by money . __eou__ It's a great place to work . They give you fair pay and benefits , and a lot of room to grow . I think if they off you a job , you should definitely take it . __eou__
We agree to give you a break on the price , all together a discount of 6 % . Good news is , I talked to my boss , he confirmed that if you take care of the shipping costs , we'll throw in insurance . __eou__ Great ! I'd love to get a little better discount than 6 % , but if your company provides the insurance , that will save us a few bucks ... __eou__ Now , all this is available to you , as far as you make payment within a 30 day grace period . That shouldn't be a problem , right ? __eou__ No ... We shouldn't have any problem with that . I know we talked about a possibility for 90 days , but we won't be needing that after your discounted price . __eou__ So , if all this is agreeable to you , I'll put it all down on paper and fax a contract to you this afternoon . If you can get a signed version of the contract we've agreed upon back to me by tomorrow morning , we can go ahead and make arrangements to ship the product on Tuesday . __eou__ Great ! __eou__
This place is great . I'm surprised there are so many things here . __eou__ Yes , but it takes a while to find things . It's not organized as carefully as a regular store . __eou__ What's the difference between an outlet and a regular store ? __eou__ Usually a clothes company will send their overstock to an outlet . The prices are very low . But you may find faulty products here too . __eou__ Faulty products ? __eou__ Yes . Sometimes the fault is very small ; if you have a needle and thread , you can fix it yourself . So it's a good deal to buy it . __eou__ Oh , that's easy for me . I think it's really a good deal . __eou__ Yes . You can save a lot of money in this way . __eou__ That's great for me . Look , children's clothes ! I'd like to buy some winter clothes for my son and daughter . __eou__ Why not buy the sweater ? It only costs 30 Yuan . __eou__ Yes , I'll take it . Are there any jeans ? Xiaohui's jeans are always dirty . I also need four pairs of slippers . __eou__ How many do you want to buy ? __eou__ I ought to make the most of it while I'm here , don't you think ? __eou__ You're right . __eou__
What were you and Richard talking about earlier ? It looked intense . __eou__ Yeah , Richard said something to me that I didn't appreciate . __eou__ Oh , no . I know how insensitive he can be . What has he done now ? __eou__ He asked me how long it took me to learn English . __eou__ But , you were born and raised in California ! __eou__ Yeah , but I get that sometimes . It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U . S . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes . __eou__ What a racist ! How can you stand working with the guy ? __eou__ You know , Richard isn't such a bad guy . He made the comment out of ignorance , not malice . __eou__ So , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn English ? __eou__ I told him 28 years . And , he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week . He was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it . __eou__ Are you sure he really got the message ? __eou__ Yeah , I'm pretty sure since I then asked him how long it took him to learn English . __eou__ That's hilarious ! What did he say ? __eou__ He said , ' 36 years , ' and we both laughed about it . He apologized and now , it's all good . __eou__ I'm glad . I bet he won't make that mistake again . __eou__
Are you alright , Ethan ? You don't seem to be as cheerful as you normally are . __eou__ To be honest , Ava , I've just had a really bad day . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ First , I slept through my alarm and ended up two hours late to work . __eou__ What did your boss say ? __eou__ He told me that if I showed up late one more time , he'd fire me . He's so mean ! __eou__ That's horrible . Was that the first time you'd shown up late to work ? __eou__ That was my second time . The first time , I was in a car accident . __eou__ Is your boss Chinese ? __eou__ No , he's from Australia . Before I met him , I thought Australians were supposed to be relaxed and easy-going . I had no idea he'd be so fussy about things . __eou__ What are you going to do ? __eou__ I think I'm going to look for another job . I need to find a boss that is a bit more sensitive and optimistic than my current boss . __eou__ That sounds like a sensible plan . Do you want me to help you with your job search ? __eou__ That's very generous of you . Thanks for the offer . __eou__ Don't mention it . That's what friends are for ! __eou__
I remember you said that you like China because it has cheap beers . __eou__ Yes , unbelievably cheap . Carlsborg is less than $ 1 . __eou__ Why do you drink ? I mean , where does drinking get you ? __eou__ It's fashionable . __eou__ Come on , you don't even know that blinds following is a sign of immaturity . __eou__ Mary , it's not about the blind following . What matter is I enjoy in drinking . It's like when you get off of work . You're so tired . You need to get relaxed . You can't just turn on the TV and keep watch the programs until you fall asleep . You need to make your after work time more fun . __eou__ How ? By drinking ? __eou__ Drinking is just part of it . I mean , you have a bunch of friends coming by and having fun . You drink and talk . And the more you drink , the more you talk . It makes me so relaxed . __eou__ When did you begin to drink ? __eou__ It's a long time ago . When I first went to a bar to pick up girls there , I saw the most beautiful girl sitting and sipping a coke . Then I went up to her and said ' can I buy you a drink ? ' __eou__ And then ? __eou__ Then I talked to her and got her number . You know what ? When you don't know what to say ? Just drink . __eou__ So you get drunk every day ? __eou__
Ok , honey , time to take down the Christmas tree . __eou__ Do we have to ? __eou__ Come on , it ’ s losing needles all the time and the branches are sagging . __eou__ It ’ s not that bad , besides it really looks nice in that corner . It gives the room a good atmosphere . __eou__ A good atmosphere ? The tree is falling apart , and it ’ s messing up the room . __eou__ But it makes the place feel so much like Christmas . I ’ d really hate to have to take it down . __eou__ But Christmas was two weeks ago ! It ’ s been there only because we ’ Ve been too busy to get rid of it . __eou__ I know , but it seems like such a shame to have to take it away . __eou__ But it ’ s falling apart , and the cat keeps playing with the lower branches . __eou__ I know , I know . But it reminds me of the great Christmas we just had . All of us were here - - my parents , your parents , the kids , and the cousins - - the food was good , and everybody got what they wanted . __eou__ Yeah , it was a good Christmas . It won ’ t always be this good , but we can ’ t make it last longer than it should . __eou__ Ok , fine . We need to take down the tree . __eou__ I ’ ll make a deal with you . We ’ ll leave it up until Sunday , and then we ’ ll take it down after church . __eou__
Sam , I am so sorry . It was your birthday yesterday and I completely forgot about it . __eou__ Don't worry about it . I keep forgetting everyone's birthdays as well . __eou__ Margaret really told me off when she found out that I had forgotten all about it . We did try to phone you , but you and Jane must have gone out . __eou__ Yes , Jane invited me for dinner to this new restaurant which opened near us . __eou__ Oh , yes , I know the one . How was the food ? __eou__ The food was excellent , but Jane ordered a birthday cake , which they forgot about . So as you can see , you were not the only one . __eou__ Oh , no . __eou__ Yes , Jane was quite upset about it . The manager came to apologize and we did get free dessert , but still ... __eou__ I would think this was the least they could do . __eou__ In the end it was a nice evening and I got an iPad as my birthday present which I wanted for a while . __eou__ Great . I have also been thinking of getting one . Do you think you could ask Jane to have a quiet word with Margaret ? My birthday is not that far away . __eou__ I can try , but knowing Margaret she will see through that immediately . __eou__
what sort of music do you like ? __eou__ I love just about anything by Prince . __eou__ so , you're into 80s music then ? __eou__ well , I like all kinds of music , but he is one of my favorites . How about you ? __eou__ I like alternative music . __eou__ do you have a favorite band ? __eou__ to be honest , no . I'm always in search of new music to listen to . __eou__ do you often go to concerts ? __eou__ I usually go to see a live band about twice a month . What about you ? __eou__ I love going to live gigs . Are there any good local bands playing around here that you'd recommend ? __eou__ there's an open mic night at the pub down the road every Thursday night where my favorite local band usually plays . You should come along next week with me . __eou__ I'd love to , but I have a night class on Thursdays . __eou__ that's too bad . Maybe another time . __eou__ let me know if you hear about any good bands playing on the weekends . I have more free time then . __eou__ I'll let you know . Did you want to watch some TV ? __eou__ sure , what's on ? __eou__ there's a reality TV show about a group of people who are trying to lose weight . __eou__ that sounds dreadful ! __eou__
Tony , could you tell me if there are any special rules about the job ? __eou__ Working hours are from 8: 30 a . m . to 5:00 p . m . Be sure not to be late or absent . Report to the manager by filling in the ' Monthly Report ' every month . __eou__ Is there anything else ? How about my salary ? __eou__ Our company has a strict and reasonable salary standard . On the 20th day of every month , you can get your salary on time . Benefits depend upon the length of service and the employee's past attendance record . __eou__ Wow , thank you for telling me these . Do you mind telling me something else , like attendance record , holiday , and how to ask for leave ? __eou__ All new members are likely to ask the same questions . Haha . I can understand that . Every month you have three days off , besides the weekends and some important holidays . After you've been here for a year , you qualify for a one-week vacation . The leave less than a half-day should predict for an hour , and more than a half-day should predict three days . __eou__ Okay , that's good . I get it . __eou__
Hi , Bill . It's Marsha Black at MPPD Ltd . How are you ? __eou__ Hello , Marsha , I haven't heard from you in a long time . I'm great , and you ? __eou__ Not too bad at all . Do you have a minute ? __eou__ Sure , what can I do for you ? __eou__ We're getting ready to place our Christmas orders and we need to know about how much it's going to run this year.You know , so we can have the funds put aside . __eou__ I'm really busy right now . I got a lot on my plate.So this isn't an actual bid you want but just a ballpark figure ? __eou__ Right , a ballpark figure is fine , and slant it a little high if you have to . __eou__ Well , I can give you those figures now over the phone , is that okay ? Or do you need them in writing ? __eou__ It's going to be shown to the Board so I need it in writing.Make all the prices subject to confirmation so you can't be held to them . How soon can I have it ? __eou__ Is this another rush , dear ? Did you forget and wait until the last minute again ? __eou__ Yeah , I'm afraid so . I really need your help here . __eou__ Well , just because it's you . Tomorrow , say around noon . __eou__
Hi , long time no see . How have you been ? __eou__ Oh , I've been fine , but I'm having some trouble with my son . __eou__ Tell me all about it . __eou__ Oh , he's 14 and in the past few months , he's become quieter and a bit secretive . He locks himself in his room and I think he's running around with the wrong crowd . __eou__ Oh , I see . What makes you think that ? __eou__ Well , he's become friends with a couple of older boys who are in a band . And one night last weekend , he came home really late , way past his curfew . __eou__ Really ? What happened ? __eou__ He told me that his friend's car broke down and they had to walk home . __eou__ I see what you mean . I understand why you're concerned . Have you tried talking to your son about it ? __eou__ I haven't yet . I just keep hoping it's just a phase he's going through . __eou__ You may be right , but it doesn't hurt to find out more about what's going on in his life . __eou__ You're right . I should talk to him . Sometimes , it's not easy being a parent . Thanks . It helps to get it off my chest . You're always so easy to talk to . __eou__ I don't know about that , but my door is always open . Stop by anytime . __eou__
what are you looking for ? __eou__ I want to buy a new camcorder for my trip this summer . __eou__ do you know what camcorder options are available ? __eou__ not really . I thought I'd just have a look today . __eou__ would you like to look at the new digital camcorders that have just come in ? __eou__ sure . I'd like to see the smallest camcorder that you have first . __eou__ ok . This Sony model is their newest and our most popular camcorder . Why don't you see if you like the way it feel ? __eou__ it's very light . That would be good . How is the battery life ? __eou__ it's got an above-average battery life . It lasts up tp 12 hours and can be charged in 30 minutes . __eou__ can you also take still photos with this ? __eou__ yes , that is an option . __eou__ how about night vision ? Can you use it in the dark ? __eou__ yes . I can show you examples of some footages that was taken with this camera in the dark . __eou__ that's not bad at all . How's the microphone ? Does it pick up much sound ? __eou__ It can record any sound that's within about 8 feet of the camera . __eou__ how does that compare with other models ? __eou__ there are models that can pick up more sound than this one , but they're much bigger and heavier than this one . __eou__ I guess you can't have everything , can you ? __eou__
My wife and I are thinking about taking our parents with us on a vacation . Do you have any suggestion about where to go ? __eou__ The choice of destination is very important . It will too energetic for the old people if you make an excursion or go to climb mountains . But they'll be interested in going to the historical places of interest where they can have fun . __eou__ Sometimes what young people like is different from the old . Maybe we can go visit first and then do some shopping . __eou__ That's a good idea . That will allow both you and your parents to enjoy yourselves . __eou__ What should we bring besides a change of clothes , money and some snacks ? __eou__ It's some medicine the doctor recommends . If you leave it at home , you will find it difficult to face up when the old people suffered a seizure . __eou__ Oh , yes ! I didn't think about that.Thank you for reminding me . How many days should we spend on a vacation ? __eou__ You'd better have all a light schedule . You can rest up for a few days if your parents find tired 。 __eou__ It seems that good planning for a family vacation is important to make sure everyone will be happy . __eou__ Yes , that's right . Having an enjoyable time together is the goal . __eou__
Hi , I am so glad to see you . __eou__ Are you kidding me ? Why do you say so ? __eou__ You know , I'm about to graduate and I have to look for a job as soon as possible . But I haven ’ t the faintest idea of how to go about finding a job . __eou__ OK . Let me see where to start . __eou__ I guess first I should prepare a resume , right ? __eou__ Sure . You should include your name , address and phone number in your resume . __eou__ Then what else should I put into my resume ? __eou__ Your job objectives , of course . In other words , what kind of job are you searching for ? __eou__ I got it . Then I should mention my educating background and working experience , should I ? __eou__ Yes . And don't forget to list them by date . Besides , you should begin with the most recent and then move backward . __eou__ I see . Is that all there is to it ? __eou__ No , it's also necessary to list a few related interests that are in some way connected to the jobs you want to take . __eou__ Oh , good point . You mean here I should show off my special skills and talents to impress the boss . __eou__ You said it . At last you ’ d better attach a list of references to your resume . __eou__ That's easy . __eou__ And one more thing , smile widely . __eou__
How is the project going ? __eou__ Well , frankly speaking , I am running a little behind . It's 40 % done . __eou__ Do you have any problem during the process ? You should speed things up . __eou__ I have little chance to communicate with colleagues when I have problems . They are always too busy to help a green hand like me . __eou__ Have you ever helped others when they are in trouble ? Most will give a hand to someone who has helped him . __eou__ I did . But I am so depressed because there is nobody that will help me . __eou__ And you should have good co-operation with other colleagues , you know a scientific schedule brings efficiency to the work . __eou__ I see your point , but I seem to be on bad terms with them . __eou__ Cheer up and pay more attention to your colleagues and the things will be much better . I am speaking from my experience . __eou__ Thank you so much . __eou__ And you should read as much as possible to enrich the knowledge . __eou__ That's a good idea . I can learn many useful things from books . __eou__ We're approaching the critical point for success or failure of this project . you'd better speed up and catch up with books . __eou__ Well , I will do it better . __eou__ If you have any problem in your work , let me know . __eou__ Thanks very much . I promise I will work harder . __eou__
Hi , Mary , can I have a minute ? __eou__ Sure , what's up ? __eou__ Well , actually I want to tell you that I've put in notice . __eou__ Really ? Why ? __eou__ Many reasons . I've been here for too long . Next year will be my five-year anniversary . I want a change of setting . Besides , our company is downsizing . I don't want to stay on just to be let go . __eou__ But they wouldn't lay you off ! You are the most experienced project manager in the company . __eou__ Maybe . But that's not kept the new boss from breathing down my neck . To be honest , I've got a better offer from another company . __eou__ Oh that's great , congratulations ! What's your new position ? __eou__ Senior director of market research . In addition to a nice pay rise it has some nice perks , like a company car , one month paid vacation , and an apartment downtown . And it's an international company so I'll have lots of chances to travel and meet new people . I'm really looking forward to it . __eou__ Sounds a great opportunity . I bet that made the decision to leave a lot easier . __eou__ Indeed . But let's stay in touch . I'll let you know how things go . __eou__ Sure . __eou__
I need a haircut . __eou__ Do you have an appointment ? __eou__ No , I don't . You look pretty busy today . Do you have an opening for me ? __eou__ Yes , we do . I can cut your hair right now if you like.Do you need a shampoo too , or just a haircut ? __eou__ Just a haircut . I washed my hair this morning . __eou__ Alright . I will have an assistant wet your hair . Then I can cut it.Please step over there.How would you like your hair cut today ? __eou__ Well , I last had a haircut eight weeks ago . So my hair is pretty long.But I want the same style . __eou__ I recommend you leave it a little long on top.But we should take in the back and sides a bit more . That's more fashionable now . __eou__ Alright . You are the expert . I'm happy to have your recommendation . __eou__ So I will cut the sides just above the ear . Is that good ? __eou__ Fine . __eou__ And do you usually part your hair along here ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Alright , I know just what to do.Your hair seems quite dry , you know . And I see some split ends . __eou__ Yes , I know my hair is quite thin.It runs in my family . Everybody has very thin hair . __eou__ The problem is the split ends . They make your hair look even more frizzy . __eou__ I don't know what to do about it . __eou__ Well , there are two things you can do.First , don't blow-dry your hair for so long after you shower . Let it dry naturally.That is easier on the hair , so you won't get split ends.Second , buy a g __eou__ Do you sell conditioner here ? __eou__ Of course . I have one I can suggest . __eou__ Great . I would be happy to try it . I know my hair doesn't look good now . It's too weak . __eou__ The problem is the split ends . __eou__

And my internship will last 1 week . I'm still a student now . __eou__ Do you mind if I ask you why you've taken the part-time job here ? __eou__ Of course not . You know , there are many foreign customers like you here . And I think it's good for me to improve my oral English . __eou__ Oh , are you an English student ? Or you just study English for interest's sake ? __eou__ No , I'm not an English student . But I do like English . I'm going to be a volunteer in the 2008 Olympics where I want to be helpful with the language . So I try to improve my English . __eou__ Very nice . Thank you for your time . __eou__ Thank you , sir . But I'm not allowed to accept any tips . __eou__ OK then . I don't want to put you in trouble . __eou__ Well , would you like something else ? The new-made cafe parfait is really good . Want some ? __eou__ OK . But I'd like some cookies . __eou__ Sure . If you want more coffee , please go over there . There is self-help coffee maker . __eou__ I surely know that . Don't forget that I am a regular customer here . __eou__ Oops . Well , wait for a while . We'll get it done quickly . __eou__ It's OK . Thank you . __eou__
Hey , what's up ? __eou__ Oh , nothing . __eou__ What were you writing ? __eou__ ( Laugh ) All right . You caught me in the act . I finally worked up the nerve to ask Diana out . I was just writing a note to put on her desk . __eou__ You mean you're going to ask her out in a note ? You big chicken ! __eou__ I admit it . I'm a wuss . I just can't do it in person . __eou__ But , you work with her everyday . __eou__ That's different . When I'm working , I'm in a different frame of mind . But , when I even think about asking her out , I get tongue-tied . At least in a note , I can get the words out without turning beet red . __eou__ You've dated a lot . What's so different about Diana ? __eou__ Well , for one thing , she's gorgeous . She's so upbeat and sweet . Who doesn't like her ? Oh , I don't know . All I do know is that I think we have great chemistry together . But , what if I'm wrong . Maybe she's just been nice to me out of courtesy and doesn't think of me that way . Oh ... forget it . This was a bad idea . __eou__ Well , I guess you don't want this note , then . __eou__ What note ? __eou__ I was looking for you to deliver this note from Diana . She wants to know if you want to go to the office party with her tomorrow night . __eou__ You're kidding ! I can't believe you've been standing this entire time and didn't say anything . __eou__ Sorry . What can I say ? Now , do you want the note or what ? __eou__ Yeah , I want the note . __eou__ Have a great time tomorrow night . __eou__ Thanks . I plan on it . __eou__

I have learnt how to ride a bicycle . I plan to go to the Water Park by bike this weekend . __eou__ Well , you know , the traffic in Beijing is sometimes dangerous .

I find that you spend little on handset charge every month . Have you any trick ? __eou__ It's simple . You can use call transfer . __eou__ Is it so simple ? __eou__ Sure . You know , we spend most of our time at home or in the office every day , so I receive handset calls with the hand-free telephone , so I need pay little for receiving calls . __eou__ It's true . __eou__ Call transfer has many other advantages . When I am in places where network can't cover , such as the high building , I also use call transfer function , which transfers my calls to the hand-free telephone and I will not miss any call . __eou__ That's all ? __eou__ In hospitals or on planes , handsets will interfere with some equip-ment , so we must close our handsets . If you set call transfer , the problem will be solved . __eou__

I remember he lectured for a half hour about that question.And you didn't write any of it ! __eou__ I know , but I listened . __eou__ Yes , but did you remember ? You need good notes to help you remember . __eou__ I suppose you're right . But what can I do ? I don't know what to write down . __eou__ There are different things you can do.For one , the university offers a special free course on note-taking.You should go to the course . Also , I am pretty good at taking notes . I can help you on this exam . I will photocopy all my notes , and you can compare them to your notes.Then maybe you will see what kinds of things to write down . __eou__ That would really help me , Sue . I appreciate it . All this makes me feel like an idiot . __eou__ Don't feel that way . I know you are very smart.Note - taking is a special skill . All students need to learn it.Some people are very smart , but they just haven't learned how to take notes yet . I'm lucky because I had a good English teacher in high school.She taught me how to take good notes . It's not hard . __eou__ Alright . University and high school seem very different to me . I suppose I just need to learn how to manage lecture classes . Then I will do better . __eou__
How did you choose courses when you were abroad ? __eou__ That's a very good question . Choosing proper courses and effectively planning a college schedule is very important to the progress toward your educational goal . In order to do these wisely and effectively , you should consult with a Program Adviser or Academic Counselor . __eou__ Wait a minute . There are some new terms for me . I can hardly follow you . __eou__ Ok , I will go into more detail . A Program Adviser or an Academic Counselor is usually an experienced professor who is responsible for all the necessary academic counseling through graduation . You can discuss with him the program selection , changing or adding a program , the requirements for graduation , and other problems related to your study . You will choose some courses , and then discuss with the adviser whether your choice can meet the requirements for graduation . __eou__ Everything is so new to me . I think I'll have to experience a very difficult period when I get there . __eou__ Sure , very difficult . __eou__ I am very grateful for your advice . __eou__ It's my pleasure to talk with you . __eou__
I've been so stressed these days . __eou__ What's the matter ? Are you OK ? __eou__ I don't know where to go for college , and what to major in . __eou__ Don't worry . You have plenty of time to decide . __eou__ And I also want to get scholarships to help me pay for the tuition . I want to get the burden off my family . __eou__ You always worry too much about everything . Take it easy , honey . You are good enough . You can go to the ideal college . __eou__ OK , OK . I'm so sorry . By the way , for you , is it more important to make money or to enjoy your work ? __eou__ In a perfect world , I would enjoy my work if I do not have to do much , and make lots of money ! __eou__ OK , honey , stop dreaming . You should face the reality . __eou__ That's only a joke . To be honest , I have to improve my English , because my English is not good enough . I still get confused about some simple grammars . Since you are quite good at it , do you have any suggestions ? __eou__ En , first you should be concentrated on what the teacher said in class . Second , I suggest you to take an additional course in some training center . __eou__ Is the training center helpful ? __eou__ I think so . Because I've taken one to improve my oral English during summer vacation . __eou__
Do you mind if I ask you a question ? __eou__ No , not at all . Go ahead . __eou__ What do you do in order to improve your English ? __eou__ I go to movies ; I go to lectures ; I listen to the radio ; I do lots of things . Most importantly , I practice every chance I get . __eou__ It ’ s a good idea to have a radio , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Sure . It ’ s like understanding on the telephone — — you can ’ t see the speaker ! It ’ s great for improving listening comprehension . __eou__ It takes a long time to learn a language , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__ It certainly does . But if you practice speaking every spare minute and learn useful sentences every day you can make big progress . __eou__
How often do you have English lessons ? __eou__ I have a lesson once a week but I try to practice every day . __eou__ How do you practice ? __eou__ I usually look at English language websites every day and go to my local English Corner twice a week . __eou__ Do you ever speak to native speakers of English ? __eou__ Sadly , I hardly ever speak to English people . I usually practice with my Chinese friends . __eou__
So , what happened ? __eou__ He never came . __eou__ He stood you up . __eou__ I wouldn ’ t exactly characterize it in that way . I think something happened . Something terrible and unexpected that made it impossible for him to ... what if he showed up , took one look at me and left ? __eou__ Not possible . __eou__ Maybe , there was a subway accident . __eou__ Absolutely . __eou__ A train got trapped underground with him inside . __eou__ And no phone . __eou__ And you know , how those express trains create suction . __eou__
On , darn . The grocery store is closed . __eou__ Yeah , this one closes at ten . We could drive to the 24 - hour store on sixth . __eou__ Alright . We are out of everything . __eou__ I wish the store close to us was open 24 - house a day . __eou__ I know , our schedules are so weird . Sometimes , the little corner store is the only thing within walking distance that ’ s open when we get home . __eou__ Yeah , and the prices there are very high . __eou__ I know . Three dollars for milk . __eou__
So , you finally got your doctorate in genetics . Well done ! __eou__ Thanks . Now , I have to find a job . __eou__ What are you thinking of doing ? __eou__ I ’ d like to conduct some scientific research into genes . It would be wonderful to make a medical breakthrough . __eou__ There must be several private companies that are interested in employing someone like you . You could do some research for a university . There ’ s a lot of discussion about genetics nowadays . Someone wit __eou__ Many companies and universities investing resources in genetics , because there are so many possibilities . Few people know where next discoveries will be made . __eou__ Well , I hope scientists don ’ t decode to make a clone of me in the future ! I wouldn ’ t like to be the subject of an experiment . __eou__
My brother started investing money when he was 16 years old . __eou__ The early bird catches the worm . __eou__
David , do you think which team will get the champion tonight ? __eou__ It is hard to guess now . Both of the teams chose the excellent players this time . I guess the game will end in a tie . They are equally matched . __eou__ I am so nervous now . What a terrific game ! __eou__ Which side are you on ? __eou__ It's hard to say , because each team has my idols . __eou__ Wow ! AC wins . It is a close shave , you know . __eou__ I will never forget this match . The angle is so terrible and so correct . __eou__ What a good goal ! __eou__
You always stick to your PC recently . Are you still fascinated by chatting on line ? __eou__ For me , the times of chatting online has gone . __eou__ What the hell are you doing now ? __eou__ I opened my blog today . In order to have more visitors , I have to land on others ' blogs and leave my messages for their blogs . __eou__ What's new with you ? __eou__ Do you still remember Justin ? __eou__ Of course , he was our monitor in college . How is him now ? __eou__ He seemed to be dumped by his girlfriend . I found his blogs were a little sad . __eou__ Let me see . What a moving poem ! __eou__
Fred , can you tell me how I can open my QQ Zone ? __eou__ Click your right key of mouse and choose QQ Zone . __eou__ Well , I have to provide some of my information , right ? __eou__ Yep ! The nick name for your zone , address , gender and so on . Some of them are privacy , so you have the right to keep secret here . __eou__ All information is filled in and now I can design my zone . __eou__ You can choose one type to make it as your background , and then find a music player and put your favorite songs into it , so your visitors can enjoy the music after entering into your zone . __eou__ Now everything is OK . I can write my blog , right ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__ ( Half an hour , Janice begins shouting excitedly . ) What's the matter with you ? __eou__ Look ! David gives his following-comment on my first blog . He is my first visitor . __eou__
Give me Scotch , please . __eou__ What brand ? __eou__ Black Rose . __eou__ Soda or water ? __eou__ Just plain water with plenty of ice rock . __eou__ All right . Please wait for a minute . __eou__
Hi Jane , can you let me know the best way to get to your house this evening ? __eou__ Certainly , where will you be coming from ? __eou__ I need to be in the city centre this afternoon so I will be coming straight from there . __eou__ Ok . Take the Underground ( the Circle line ) to High Street Kensington . Make sure you take the High Street Kensington exit . __eou__ Got that . __eou__ Ok - when you leave the Underground , cross the road and you should see Horntown Street . Was up that street to the crossroads . As you was you should see a fast food place on your right . __eou__ Hold on , I am looking at the map now . Ok , I can see Horntown Road . Do I go straight at the intersection ? __eou__ No , you need to turn left into Philimore Was and take the next right . __eou__ Ok , I can see that road . __eou__ That's fine . You will not miss it because it's just next to the Kensington centra Library . __eou__ Good , I can see the library on the map . __eou__ Ok , we live in the third building on your left . Will we see you around 7 pm ? __eou__ That's great , see you at seven . __eou__
I hear you are expecting your family . __eou__ Yes , my parents , and soon my brother as well . __eou__ I didn't know you had a brother . __eou__ Oh , yes , he is two years older than me . He lives in New Zealand so I don't see him that often . __eou__ Oh , nice . Is he coming on his own or with the family ? __eou__ His son is coming as well . He wants to go to university here in England so they will visit a few universities while they are here . __eou__ Does your brother have just one son ? __eou__ No , he has two daughters as well . His wife and daughters are visiting her parents . So I won't see them . __eou__ I'm sure your parents are looking forward to seeing their grandson . __eou__ Oh yes , they are really looking forward to it . They went to New Zealand last year and loved it . __eou__ So when are they all coming ? __eou__ My parents are already here . My brother and nephew are arriving on Monday . __eou__
Do you want to hear a funny joke ? __eou__ OK . Are you sure it's funny , though ? __eou__ Well , you'll see . __eou__ OK . __eou__ OK , an Englishman , a Scotsman , and an Irishman were going on a trip across the desert , and they could only take one thing with them . __eou__ I see . __eou__ So they met up at the start of the journey and showed each other their equipment . __eou__ Oh , that's funny ! __eou__ Hang on , I haven't finished yet . __eou__ Oh , sorry . __eou__ Well , as I was saying , they showed each other what they had decided to bring . The Englishman had brought some water . " If we get thirsty , we'll have something to drink , " he said . The Scotsman brought a map . " If we get lost , we'll be able to find our way . " The Irishman had brought a car door . __eou__ A car door ? You mean just one car door ? __eou__ Yep . A car door . " Why the door ? " the others asked him . " Well , " he said , “ If it gets hot , we can open the window . " Do you get it ? __eou__ Well ... __eou__
A funny thing happened to me the other day . __eou__ Oh , yes ? __eou__ I was just thinking about someone I went to school with , this boy I was quite friendly with in third grade . We used to hang out together - he lived next door - but then my parents moved and I changed schools and never saw him again . __eou__ Mmm . __eou__ Well , I was walking down Nan Jing Dong Lu ( Nan-Jing E . Rd . ) during my lunch break thinking about this boy-I have no idea why I was thinking about him . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes . And suddenly I heard someone call my name . I turned around and there was this man looking at me . I didn't recognize him at all , but he obviously knew who I was . __eou__ Oh , yeah , that's embarrassing when that happens . __eou__ You got it . Well , he walked up to me and said my name again and then I realized it was the boy I had been thinking about , the one from third grade ! __eou__
I haven't seen your father in like 5 years . How is he doing ? __eou__ He's not doing too well . __eou__ Why ? What's wrong ? __eou__ About a year ago , he started feeling weak all the time . __eou__ Is it due to old age or is he sick . __eou__ Maybe a little of both . The doctor's can't point out anything specifically . I think it is because he didn't take care of himself during his youth . __eou__ That makes sense . It's important to take care of your health early in life . __eou__ That's what my father tells me almost everyday . __eou__ Well , I hope he starts feeling better . Say hi to him for me . __eou__ Thanks . I'll let him know . __eou__
Have you considered upgrading your system ? __eou__ Yes , but I'm not sure what exactly I would need . __eou__ You could consider adding a painting program to your software . It would allow you to make up your own flyers and banners for advertising . __eou__ That would be a definite bonus . __eou__ You might also want to upgrade your hardware because it is pretty outdated now . __eou__ How can we do that ? __eou__ You'd probably need a faster processor , to begin with . And you also need a more powerful hard disc , more memory and a faster modem . Do you have a CD-ROM drive ? __eou__ No . __eou__ Then you might want to add a CD-ROM drive too , because most new software programs are coming out on Cds . __eou__ That sounds great . Thanks . __eou__
I hear scientists in the US have discovered a new AIDS vaccine . __eou__ Does it work ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . The report says it is better than the old vaccines . __eou__ Don ’ t count on it . I think the best way to prevent AIDS is to keep yourself clean by having clean sex and keeping a regular sex partner . __eou__ Right . That ’ s why doctor say AIDS prevention means cleanness . __eou__
Hi , Mrs . Henderson . __eou__ Hi , Steven . Do you have time and chat with me ? __eou__ Of course I have plenty of time . What's new ? __eou__ The new couple next door divorced . Have you heard about it ? __eou__ No . The Hills ? Who filed for divorce first ? __eou__ I guess it Is Mrs Hill . She sued for divorce on the grounds of her husband's misconduct with his secretary . __eou__ Oh , maybe not . It's just your guess . Do not give currency to idle gossip . __eou__ OK . I close my mouth . __eou__
Hello , Tom . Where are you heading for ? __eou__ I am going to a movie theater . You know there is a new action film produced by Hollywood . A thriller , really . __eou__ Another terror film ? There is too much terror and violence in the films . Do you like seeing such a picture ? __eou__ I don't really like seeing bloody frames , but I appreciate the lifelike frames simulated with the highly skillful special effects . __eou__
Well , how was your honeymoon ? __eou__ It was fantastic ! We had such a good time . The only problem was that because it was their high season , we spent hours queuing . __eou__ Peak periods always entail hours of queuing . At least you got a nice tan though ! __eou__ Yes , Florida had great weather while we were there . You look tan , too . Did you go somewhere ? __eou__ My friends and I just got back from Bali . __eou__ Wow ! Bali Islands have some of the best beaches in the world , don't they ? __eou__ Yes , we were lucky . My friend's father owns a resort on one of the islands , so we were able to stay for free . __eou__ Did you go diving while you were there ? __eou__ I took a few diving classes , but I didn't really like it , so I did snorkeling instead ! __eou__ Did you take any pictures in the ocean ? __eou__ I've got quite a few pictures of all different kinds of fish . I'll show them to you next time I see you . __eou__ Have you started planning your christmas vacation yet ? __eou__ We're planning on going skiing in Switzerland . Do you ski ? __eou__ No , but I do like snowboarding . __eou__ Would you like to go skiing with us for christmas ? __eou__ I'll talk to my husband about it ; I'm sure he'll say yes ! He loves Switzerland ! __eou__ It is Europe's spotless land of lakes and mountains ! Let me know as soon as you can so we can get a discount . __eou__
We'd like a half-day package . __eou__ We offer many different sea water treatments . __eou__ How many can we choose ? __eou__ The aquamedic pool is included . You can choose three . __eou__ We'll do the seaweed wrap , the jet bath , and the foot massage . __eou__ OK . Here are your robes . You can go shower first . __eou__
Some people pile on their agonise and try to seek other ’ s sympathy by telling them how miserable they are . __eou__ Yeah . They take the advantage of other people's hospitality and generosity . __eou__ I was fooled once . A lady told me she needed some money to keep the pot boiling . So I gave her some money and bailed her out of the situation . But later I learned that she had lied to me . __eou__ You are still wet behind the ears . You should have seen through her . __eou__ Nothing rang a bell . __eou__
Hi Julie , how are things going ? __eou__ Everything is great , Tad . How are you ? __eou__ I'm doing really well . __eou__ Tad , I'm pretty hungry right now . Want to walk over and check out the food table ? __eou__ Julie , do you know who that woman is over there by the window ? __eou__ That is Mary . I heard that she's just moved in with Lee . __eou__ I thought that he was with Malia . __eou__ Oh , that relationship is history . Malia hooked up with a guy she met on holiday . __eou__ I bet that Lee wasn't too happy with that ! __eou__ Actually , he was OK with it . They hadn't been getting along too well . __eou__
Guess who I saw just now ? __eou__ Who ? __eou__ John Smith , the escaped criminal . __eou__ That bad egg , who took the low road since he was a boy . __eou__ I think I must report to the cops . __eou__ Ok . __eou__
I have some good news for you . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ Jenny is getting married . __eou__ Great ! Who's the bridegroom ? __eou__ Tom , that lucky guy . __eou__ The guy always hands the girls in a line . When did he propose ? __eou__ Last week , It said that he fell in love with Jenny at Mrs.Whit ' s party last Monday as soon as he saw her . __eou__ My gosh ! How romantic ! When's the big day ? __eou__ July 4 , the National Holiday . __eou__ Will it be a church wedding or a civil ceremony ? __eou__ Jenny plans to hold it in church . __eou__ Who is the best man ? __eou__ Guess ! __eou__ Nobody is OK , but you ! __eou__ You know , Tom is my best friend and he asked me to be his best man . __eou__ Did you promise him ? __eou__ Yes , I did . __eou__
This is my house.Let me show you around it . __eou__ How beautiful the detached house is ! __eou__ Follow me to the back-yard . __eou__ It's marvelous ! The lawn looks like a green carpet , and the garden with so many lovely flowers . __eou__ We had the grass cut and the flowers trimmed this morning . __eou__ No wonder it smells fragrant . __eou__ Here is the swimming pool and we can swim later . __eou__ It's fantastic ! __eou__
Hello . Could I speak to Justin , please ? __eou__ Speaking . __eou__ Oh , hi Justin . This is Karen Hepburn.We met at Chris and Jim's party . __eou__ Of course . How're you ? __eou__ Great . Uh , Justin , would you like to see Otis Lesley on Thursday night ? He's at the Kangaroo Club . __eou__ I'm sorry , Karen , but I can't . I have to work late this Thursday . __eou__ Oh ... that's too bad . __eou__ Yeah . I really like Lesley . __eou__ Actually , are you doing anything on Friday or Saturday ? He's playing those two nights as well . __eou__ Well , I can't make it on Friday either , but I'm free on Saturday night . What time does it start ? __eou__ At eight sharp.How about meeting in front of the club at about a quarter after seven ? __eou__ That sounds perfect.And let's go out for coffee after the show . __eou__ Sure ! __eou__ See you at seven fifteen , Saturday . __eou__
He is penny wise and pound-foolish . __eou__ Why do you say so ? __eou__ The trash of the world he sets high price upon , but the heavenly things he shamefully undervalues . __eou__ Maybe all of us are the same . __eou__
Hi Amanda , how are you ? I've missed working with you and the whole gang since my transfer last week . __eou__ We've missed you too . The office just isn't the same without you . How is your new job ? __eou__ It's great . I really get to focus on what I like to do and everyone has been very nice and welcoming . However , I'm having a small problem with my new colleagues . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ Well , three people are celebrating their birthdays this month and the policy here is for everyone to contribute ten dollars to a card and cake for each person . __eou__ Wow , so you'll be out thirty dollars on your first week at work ! __eou__ I know . It is a lot of money and I haven't gotten to know any of the people celebrating their birthdays well enough yet . At our old department , it was only three dollars for each birthday and there were only ten of us . __eou__ Well , every department is different . You wouldn't want your new co-workers to think you're a Grinch , right ? __eou__ What is that ? __eou__ A Grinch is a person who spoils the mood at a happy occasion by being selfish or unenthusiastic . You know - a party proper . __eou__ I definitely don't want to be that ! But , I still think it's unreasonable for them to ask me for such a big sum of money when we don't know each other very well . What should I do ? __eou__
Excuse me . Where is Q-Duck ? I remember it was around the second intersection of this street . __eou__ Q-Duck ? Do you mean the famous roast-duck store ? __eou__ Yes , definitely . __eou__ They have moved to some other places long time ago . __eou__ Wow , this place is quite different from ten years ago when I first came to China . __eou__ Yeah , a lot of changes have happened here . __eou__ This street used to have few stores . But now , you can see supermarkets , shopping malls and department stores everywhere . __eou__ Yeah , they are my wife's heaven , but not mine . I always get lost in the supermarket . __eou__ Me too ! I was lost three times ten years ago . There were no English directions then . __eou__ Is that better now ? __eou__ Yeah , there are many English signs , and wrong spellings as many as them . __eou__
Daniel , what are you doing here ? Aren't you supposed to be at school now ? __eou__ The same question to you . __eou__ Well , we shall make it a secret between us . __eou__ Deal , Where is Gucci ? __eou__ She is the cheer-leader . They are required to put on a performance . Look ! Here they come . __eou__ Oh , look at her . She looks like one is the basketball babies in NBA . __eou__ I want to be like her . __eou__ Get real . Don't be so pathetic . __eou__ Hey , young man ! I'm your sis . Don't talk to me like that . __eou__ Oh , man , look at her , go ! She is amazing ! She should be my sis . __eou__ Boy , you've got such a crush on her , haven't you ? __eou__ Yes , I want to be her boyfriend . Just like in the movie . __eou__ Are you out of your mind ? __eou__ She told me she liked my new haircut . She thought it was cool . __eou__ Go ahead , have a try and be a joke . __eou__
Here's Copellini's , my cousin's store . __eou__ Sounds like an Italian name with an “ i ” at the end . __eou__ Admit it . You just think of Mussolini . __eou__ No , I'm an art lover , so I think more of Bellini and Botticelli ! __eou__ Ah , yes . The Italians do love the sensual forms of the human body . __eou__ Don't we all ... hey ! Your cousin sells gift items ? __eou__ Yeah-all from Italy . See all the saints ? They're important to Roman Catholics . __eou__
Holly , I just heard some terrible news . __eou__ Me , too . I overheard someone say Taylor has a brain tumor . __eou__ What ? No , I heard that he has stomach cancer . His ex-girlfriend said it . __eou__ That could explain all his stomachaches . He's trying to hide it from us . __eou__ Maybe that's why he didn't show up at the potluck . Have you seen him ? __eou__ No , but someone said he was in the men's room puking . Follow me ! __eou__
Boy , it looks like everyone in your family is here , from young to old . __eou__ Easter's a good day for reunions . The family goes to church together . __eou__ And after church they come here for lunch ? __eou__ Yup , a big potluck buffet . And then-notice there are no children around ? __eou__ Yeah , what's up with that ? __eou__ The kids wait in the house while the grownups hide these . Hide away , Yi-jun ! __eou__
Where are we headed now ? __eou__ To a historic coffeehouse . It's got a little Mafia story to it . __eou__ Awesome . Was someone killed there ? __eou__ Oh , yeah , while he was eating , and he was a pretty famous Don . __eou__ Cool ! Is it safe for us to eat there though ? __eou__ Sure . In fact , nowadays , you'll see more tourists there than Italians . There are Mafia tours nowadays that go there to eat . __eou__
What a letdown . I wanted to experience some Mafia culture firsthand . __eou__ It's worth it just to go and eat what the mafia eat ! The five-dollar tiramisu is a culinary orgasm . __eou__ Such a thing exists ? __eou__ Fortunately , yes . You're blushing ! __eou__ Am I ? Um ... my face gets red when I walk too fast . __eou__ You're embarrassed , aren't you ? You gotta loosen up in Little Italy . The lady at the cafe will kiss you when you meet her ... __eou__
What ’ s the area of your country ? __eou__ It ’ s not very big . It ’ s a little over half a million square kilometers . __eou__ That sounds quite big ! How many people live there ? __eou__ There are about 30 million people in my country . Most of them live in the north . __eou__ What ’ s the average income ? __eou__ That ’ s the really hard to say . I think most people earn about two thousand dollars a month , if you convert the money from our currency into dollars . __eou__ So your country is fairly rich . __eou__ I think we are richer than most countries , but not as rich as countries in western Europe . Our biggest problem at the moment is unemployment , which is roughly 8 % . It has doubled over the last four years . __eou__ Unemployment in my country is a fraction of that . __eou__
Management is going through a big turnover these days . With Bill's retirement , and department realignment , we have lost about 1/3 of our managerial staff . They've been dropping like flies ... __eou__ Isn't that a good thing ? Having fewer bosses means having less stress , don't you think ? __eou__ Actually , I don't think so . Supervisors are really important to make sure everything goes smoothly in the workplace . They are necessary for divvying up work and disciplining employees . If there is no one to keep an eye on us , no one would get any work done . You know what they say , when the cat's away , the mice play . __eou__ You're right , we do need leadership . But what we don't need is too many people to lead us . You know what they say about too many chiefs and not enough Indians ... __eou__ Alright ... I get your point . __eou__
Hey , Frank . I heard you got a new job . __eou__ Yeah , Judy . I will be working for the Post Office . It ’ s not a bad job . __eou__ Is it true that you have a heavy work schedule ? __eou__ That ’ s right . I report to work at 5am everyday , and I only get 45 minutes for lunch . __eou__ So , why did you apply for such a demanding job ? __eou__ Well , the government offers its employees excellent health insurance benefits . __eou__ Oh , I see . And can your family utilize 5 the health insurance , too ? __eou__ Yeah , that ’ s the best part . All of my children can get free medical care . __eou__ That ’ s a great employment benefit ! __eou__ Now you know why I wanted to work for the Post Office ! __eou__
Don't you feel a little strange taking the place of your old boss after he was demoted ? __eou__ Yes , at first I felt very awkward . After Bill was demoted and then resigned , it was kind of like somebody died ! I mean the atmosphere in the office was like a funeral parlor or something . And then I was afraid people would look at me as a traitor for filling in his spot when the management asked me to ... __eou__ Did they mutiny ? __eou__ Thankful , no . I guess everyone understands the opportunity I had to step into a leadership role is so great for my career . I'm really moving up the ladder now that I'm considered a supervisor . After a couple weeks , it was like nothing happened . __eou__ It is a really good chance for you to get more exposure at work . supervisors get to take the credit for all the hard work of the people under them . __eou__ Yeah , and they also take the blame , that's what happened to my old boss ... __eou__

Here is the final draft of our contract . I'm glad that we have reached an agreement on almost every term in our trade . __eou__ Yes , it seems to me we have come quite a long way . However , let me take a close look at the final draft . __eou__ Do you have some points to bring up ? __eou__ Well , everything we've discussed seems to be here . __eou__ Yes , including a description of the shirts you want to purchase this time , the total amount of your order , the price for each piece , mode of payment , packaging , shipping time , insurance and compensation , claim and arbitration , and rights and duties for both sides . Are all the terms here satisfactory ? __eou__ I'll need a few minutes to check over my notes again on every detail . What about the quality standard ? __eou__ It is said that the sample 25 is the standard for others . It's complete . So would you like to sign the contract right now ? __eou__
We've settled price , order , payment , now I am calling to ask about package . How can we pack the goods ? __eou__ As a rule , we use cardboard boxes for outer packing . Besides , I would like to make it clear that each piece of computer will be dismantled into several parts before shipment . __eou__ Do you mean that we are responsible for putting them together ? __eou__ Yes . As you know , that's the common practice for exporting computer . This can avoid some damages on computers in the process of transportation . __eou__ I see . Why not use wooden cases ? __eou__ If you prefer wooden cases , we will provide them . But cardboard boxes are light , less expensive , and more convenient to handle in the course of packing and unpacking . __eou__ Oh , I know . Does it mean that shipment will have to be delayed if I insist on using wooden cases ? __eou__ Perhaps . That will be more complicated , if we use wooden boxes . __eou__ Then you may use cardboard boxes for outer packing so long as you can guarantee the safety of the computers . __eou__ That is guaranteed . Each box is lined with foam plastic in order to prevent damage by air , water or stress . Besides , cardboard boxes will be secured together on wood pallets by overall metal strapping . __eou__ Sounds good . __eou__
Do you get the news that our company is trying to find out new tactics to test us ? __eou__ I know something about it . Our company often organizes all kinds of lectures to improve our professional skills . __eou__ It takes most of our weekends to listen to these boring lectures , so I can not bear it anymore . It is said that they think out some tests to check our management skills . __eou__ Is that true ? __eou__ Definitely ! __eou__ If that information is exact , I guess our company is willing to promote someone . __eou__
Well , let's have your firm order . __eou__ Yes , here is our offer , 30,000 skirts at 200 yuan per skirt , FOB New York .

Can you bring the price down a little ? __eou__ In fact , if it weren't for our good relations , we wouldn't consider making you a firm order at this price . __eou__ I can't agree with you . We have quotation from other sources too . Their prices are lower than yours . __eou__ But you know our design is superior to any other products from other companies . In fact , there is no room to negotiate the price now . You should be aware that the production cost alone has doubled in the past year . __eou__ It doesn't seem very hopeful to close the deal on this price . __eou__

How many people does your company employ ? __eou__ We have over sixty employees . We have about forty factory workers and technical people and the rest are admin and sales staff . We started off with only ten people , so our workforce has grown a lot . __eou__ What's your annual turnover ? __eou__ It was just over two million euros last year . __eou__
OK , so this is the main factory area . We're now walking past the printing machine . It's printing in four colours at the moment . __eou__ What's going on over there ? __eou__ They're setting up the machine for a new run . __eou__ How long does that usually take ? __eou__ About twenty minutes . __eou__ What's happening at the far end ? __eou__ That's the packing line . The goods are being wrapped and loaded onto pallets ready for transportation . __eou__
How do you dispose of the waste in your factory ? __eou__ We try to recycle as much as we can . __eou__ What about the rest ? How do you get rid of it ? __eou__ We have to send it to landfill . It's very expensive because the government recently introduced a landfill tax so we're planning to build a new incineration plant next year to burn our waste . __eou__ But doesn't incineration produce carbon monoxide ? __eou__ Yes , you're right , it does . But we believe it's less harmful to the environment than landfill __eou__
Dentale Associates . I'm afraid there's nobody available to answer your call . Please leave your name and telephone number and we'll call you back .

How many foreign languages can you speak ? __eou__ Only English . __eou__ What do you think of your English ? __eou__ I have passed CET - 6 and I am proficient in reading and translating foreign materials . I have rich translating experience because I used to be an English translator . __eou__ Can you speak English fluently ? __eou__ I have received an oral English training and I can communicate with others fluently . __eou__ Did you take TOEFL or GRE ? __eou__ Yes , I did . I got 600 in TOEFL and 2 , 300 in GRE . __eou__ When did you begin to learn English ? __eou__ I started to learn English when I was in primary school . __eou__ Do you think your English is good enough to do office work ? __eou__ The amount of English I know enables me to do general desk work . I believe the amount of English I know is sufficient to work in a South Korea firm . __eou__
Are you familiar with American-styled accounting ? __eou__ I am afraid not . I haven't worked in an American company so far . __eou__ What are the most fundamental concepts underlying the accounting process ? __eou__ The first is accounting entity , and the second is going concern . The third is measuring unit . The fourth is accounting period , and the fifth is objectivity . __eou__
Jim , what do you think of that first interviewee ? __eou__ Well , he looked sharp and he came across as a very confident guy . __eou__ Okay , what about the first woman ? __eou__ She looked a little rough around the edges but had great skills . __eou__ All right , and what about the older gentle ? __eou__ He was very distinguished , maybe a bit over-qualified . __eou__ Ohhhh . I hate this part of my job . __eou__ Why don't you go over the resumes again ? They might help you decide who to hire . __eou__
What's your ideal boss ? __eou__ I have had an incredible boss , who was my direct supervisor during the last year of my coop work experience . A-bout two months after I began working for her , she really let me spread my wings . She encouraged me to work independently , because she said she had come to trust my judgment and commitment . So I was able to move forward on projects without having to check in with her every day . Of course , I made certain that she knew what I had accomplished on a daily and weekly basis because I gave her summary reports , although she didn't specifically ask me to . Without her support and encouragement , I don't think I would have felt confident enough to have written up a proposal suggesting that the department change a process that had been in place for a long time . But she was open to suggestions , so long as employees could back them up with research and facts . When I submitted my suggestion , she reviewed it and told me where she thought it needed more work . She then took my revised proposal to her boss . He was a more conservative type , but she lobbied him to try It for several weeks . He did , and it was so successful that it was instituted as a permanent change . I've also worked for some very difficult bosses in summer and part-time jobs . And while I'd certainly prefer to work for one like I've just described , I'm the kind of person who can get along with just about anyone . __eou__
Are there any special requirements on the project ? And shall we talk around it in details ? __eou__ Yes , there're some samples in our office and you can take some to study it . Besides , you see , in recent years , we've visited a diversity of factory buildings all over the world and we hope that our building is the perfect match of advanced technology and attractiveness . __eou__ That's a good idea . We can improve our technology to meet your special need . __eou__ And please let white color dominate . __eou__ OK ! I've noted it down . And any others ? __eou__ Oh ! I've almost forgot the location was transferred to the A county in the east of the city . __eou__ I'll tell them . __eou__ Well , the most important thing is that our company demand the quality be exactly the same as the sample which you'll take from the office on the third floor . __eou__ Please feel assured that we'll abide by our promise . And we'll do everything we can to ensure delivery . __eou__ Thanks a lot . And I believe I'll have a good time working with you . __eou__ I think so . Bye ! __eou__ Bye ! __eou__

There isn't . Because different people have to write different kinds of reports . __eou__ But I don't know how to work the Microsoft Words .

How can we develop a new brand image with no direction whatsoever ? __eou__ With the fifty forwards he sent out today , maybe we'll inadvertently get inspired . __eou__ I guess this is a good excuse to surf the Net on someone else's dime . __eou__ Who'd have thought Bean would be this kind of e-mail fanatic ? __eou__ He must have just got online for the first time last week . He still thinks it's some kind of new toy . __eou__
Next is a ballet performance , but who is the dancer ? __eou__ I'd swear that's Eddy from circulation . __eou__ Since when did Eddy start doing ballet ? ! __eou__ Not very long from the looks of it ! __eou__ Look ! He has a partner ! __eou__ He's dancing with Jack ! __eou__ Gross ! __eou__ The wei-ya is the one time a year you can make fun of the boss . __eou__ But I think Eddy is going too far ! __eou__ You're right . They are spinning pretty fast . Aren't they getting dizzy ? What if they fall ... __eou__ Oh ! Ouch ! That must've hurt ! __eou__ How embarrassing ! __eou__
If we are to modernize our information processing , manufacturing system and management code , we need to complete our office automation . __eou__ Yes , you're right . We have to equip our company with a network of workstations at every office as soon as possible . __eou__ Our copying machines are too slow , our telephone system is limited in function , and our offices are not well-equipped for us to work efficiently . To improve the offices for higher efficiency , we have to change all the chairs and some of the desks also , redesign our office so that we may have more space . __eou__ Good . We can contact the Tiana Office Furniture Store , and ask them to install computers in our company , deliver new tables and other furniture to match the function of the computers , and to improve our work atmosphere simultaneously . __eou__
Excuse me , sir , may I talk to you ? __eou__ Bill ! Sure , come on in . What can I do for you ? __eou__ Well sir , as you know , I have been an employee of this prestigious firm for over ten years . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I won ’ t beat around the bush . Sir , I would like a raise . I currently have three companies after me and so I decided to talk to you first . __eou__ A raise ? Son , I would love to give you a raise , but this is just not the right time . __eou__ I understand your position , and I know that the current economic downturn has had a negative impact on sales , but you must also take into consideration my hard work , pro-activeness and loyalty to this company for over a decade . __eou__ Taking into account these factors , and considering I don ’ t want to start a brain drain , I ’ m willing to offer you a ten percent raise and an extra five days of vacation time . How does that sound ? __eou__ Great ! It ’ s a deal ! Thank you , sir ! __eou__ Before you go , just out of curiosity , what companies were after you ? __eou__ Oh , the electric company , gas company and water company ! __eou__
Where is the boss ? I need him to sign a few documents . I checked in his office , but he is not there . Is he out of the office now ? __eou__ Yes . Today is Tuesday , so the boss went off to his MBA seminar class . He is out of the office every Tuesday and Thursday mornings , and he has classes all day Saturday and Sunday . __eou__ What's he studying ? __eou__ He is finishing up a special continue education program for executives . He can continue working , taking a few of classes here and there , and in 2 years he will complete his MBA . __eou__ Sounds like a tiring schedule.He ’ s probably got a lot of homework too , eh ? __eou__ The classes have him out of the office , so that is stressful for him . But as far as homework goes , it is a breeze for him . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ He just has his secretary do his homework for him . __eou__
We are going to need confirmation on these orders today , and delivery must be made before next Tuesday . Do you think you can handle that ? __eou__ We are willing to work with you , but do you think it would be possible to extend your confirmation deadline ? We need to check the warehouse to make sure the products are in stock . The earliest I will be to get back to you is tomorrow morning . __eou__ No , I must know today because we have to go to press for the advertisements . Is there anyway you can speed up the process of checking inventory ? __eou__ We can do that , but it will cost ... If we have to check our inventory with all our guys on overtime , you're looking at an increased cost of , I'd say , maybe 10 % . __eou__ Are you kidding ? __eou__ No , and let me tell you why ... If I make my guys stay over to check the inventory , I'll have to pay them at an overtime rate , which is time and a half . I estimate it will probably take 3 guys two hours to finish , that will be an increase on your labor fee by at least 10 % ... if you need the numbers that urgently , I can have them do it . Otherwise , we can wait until tomorrow morning , and I'll call you with the numbers after they're done . It's your call ... __eou__

Print shop . Seam speaking . __eou__ Hi , Sean . It ’ s Mary in Mr . Emory ’ s office . I placed an order for 1,000 bound copies of a staff manual last week . __eou__ It usually takes 2 to 3 weeks to complete a job like that . __eou__ Well , I was hoping you would do me a big favor . That was supposed to be a rush order , I forgot to tell you . I ’ m getting a lot of flak from my boss . __eou__
Hi . I ’ m here for flight 514 returning to Beijing but the board shows there is a delay.How long of a delay is expected ? __eou__ So far it looks like we will be leaving two hours late , but keep checking the departing flights status board just in case . __eou__ Do you think it ’ s safe to leave to get a quick bite ? __eou__ I think you should stay in the airport . Even though the delay is expected to be two hours , the flight departure could be announced any minute . Who knows ? __eou__ What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ It seems there are some loose bolts on one of the wings . It happens all the time . No need to worry . __eou__ Umm ... You know ... Actually I was thinking of trying another airline . No need to hold my seat . __eou__
I wish the politicians would quit digging up dirt about each other's past . __eou__ I know . It really makes a mess of the whole election process . __eou__ And it takes up all the news . __eou__ The problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up . __eou__ It's so small . The fact that there is public interest , doesn't say much for us as the public . __eou__ Have you ever listened to AM radio ? It's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on TV and FM radio . __eou__ I don't remember the last time I listened to AM radio . __eou__ Another place you can get real insight is European papers . You can get them on-line . __eou__
Personal Loans , how may I help ? __eou__ I'm going to be studying overseas next year and I'd like some info about suitable loans . To be honest , I'm not even sure if I can get a loan . __eou__ Not a problem . We offer a Personal Loan for Studying Abroad for anyone who's studying overseas , regardless of the circumstances . Anyone is eligible to apply __eou__ Would I have to get my parents to guarantor the loan ? __eou__ Not exactly . Our policy states that the loange could be the person studying abroad , for example , you , or your direct relative or spouse . __eou__ I see . What about age limitations ? __eou__ There are no age limitations as such just that the loange should be below 55 years and of course , old enough to get a loan , meaning over 18 years of age . __eou__ Got it ! I fit into that category very nicely . That's great ! I'll have a chat with my parents and come back . Thanks very much . __eou__
Good afternoon . What can I do for you today , Madam ? __eou__ It's a little sensitive , actually . I need to get hold of some money , and quickly . __eou__ OK , Madam . We are here to help . __eou__ I already have some Time Deposits with you , but unfortunately , they haven't matured yet . I really don't want to cash those just yet . __eou__ I understand completely . There are other options , such as a Personal Pledge Loan . __eou__ I've not heard of that , could you tell me more , please ? __eou__ The procedure is really simple and convenient . All you need to do is fill in this Loan Application form . __eou__ Right ... anything else ? __eou__ Of course , we'll need some documentation from you . Like your resident permit , proof of salary and your USD Deposit Certificate , to use as collateral . __eou__ And then I just sign here ? You're right ! It certainly is simple and extremely convenient . __eou__
Loans Department , how can I help you ? __eou__ Hello . Could you give me some details about your Personal Pledge Loans , please ? __eou__ Certainly , Sir . I'd be happy to . The Personal Pledge Loan is a loan secured by undue certificates , Time Deposits , for example , or Visible Treasury Bonds . __eou__ So , as long as I have one of those , I can apply for a Personal Pledge Loan ? __eou__ That's correct , Sir . The bank will issue receipt to you and also take care of all the pledged securities . __eou__ Mmmm ... how about the period of repayment ? __eou__ The maximum maturity period is a year , but it also cannot exceed the maturity on the certificates used as collateral . __eou__ And the maximum loan amount ? __eou__ The initial amount is just 2,000 RIB , but we can go up to 100,000 RIB . But remember , it cannot exceed the amount on the certificates you are using as collateral . __eou__ OK . I'll have a look at what I've got exactly in certificates and get back to you . Thanks for your help . Bye . __eou__ My pleasure , Sir . Bye . __eou__
Good afternoon , it's nice to see you again . Have you decided to go ahead and try for the Fixed Asset Loan ? __eou__ I'm going to need some more info first . I was wondering about the repayments . How long would I have to pay back the loan ? __eou__ That depends . Our repayment plans go from 1 year to 10 years . The Fixed Asset Loan is a long-term loan , you see . The loan can be paid in either monthly or quarterly instalments , to suit your needs . __eou__ And how much is payable in each instalment ? __eou__ You will need to pay part of the principle sum and part of the interest due . __eou__ Well , as far as I can see , the advantages outweigh the disadvantages . You've sold me ! I'd like to go ahead . __eou__
I am afraid the label is not quite suitable for this locality . Could you quote us for the order with neutral cases ? __eou__ I am afraid not . We usually design the label ourselves . You know we should be responsible for the brand labels of our goods . __eou__ In that case , we'd like you to make some changes in the labeling . __eou__ What are they ? __eou__ First , the languages on the label should be in both English and French . Second , the red color doesn't suit our national customs . Could you print the label in some light colors such as yellowish or bluish ? __eou__ That can be easily done . Is there anything else ? __eou__ The brand name and the nice artwork need not be changed , but the net weight must be placed on the lower part of the panel . __eou__ We'll get the factory to meet your requirements . __eou__ Thanks for your help . __eou__
How much will our order from your factory be ? __eou__ I'll be happy to get back to you with an estimate in the next few days . __eou__ I'm afraid I can't wait that long . Can your office at least provide me with a ballpark figure ? __eou__ Well , I would need an idea of how large your order would be . About how many units would you need ? __eou__ Just give me an estimated figure for an order of 100 units . __eou__ Please give me a few minute to calculate ... Our asking price should be about $ 100 per unit with an order of 100 . Is that price acceptable to you ? __eou__ Your estimated is seems a little high to me , we're willing to pay $ 80 per unit . __eou__ Would an order of only 100 units , it'll be difficult to work within that kind of budget . Maybe if you were ordering 500 units or more units , we might be able to work something out . __eou__
What happens if we make a deal and thirty to sixty days after delivery the price goes down and you didn't get the best possible price ? How do I handle that ? __eou__ Well , these things happens , I know that . You just have to stay straight with me . __eou__ Right ! So how do I do that ? What will make you happy ? __eou__ Well , I suggest you just keep me posted.That should do it.That way the burden is on me to decide when to buy , not you . __eou__ Excuse me ? __eou__ Yeah , it really is that simple.Every time there's a change in the items we do business on , you let me know . That's all you need to do . __eou__ What kind of change , just in prices ? __eou__ No , any change . I want you to keep me as informed as you are . I need to know as much as you do . If you hear about something that might happen , then tell me about it.Tell me it's rumor , what it's based on and your opinion on how likely it is . __eou__ You mean on product availability , reliability and price ? __eou__ No , everthing.Those things for sure , but also labor problems , raw materials , new subcontractors , mergers , in short , anything and everything.So I can make a fully informed decision . __eou__ So it's like you want me to be your eyes and ears into the industry . I can do that , provided the company I'm working for isn't hurt . __eou__ I think we'll get along fine . __eou__
Hello , what can I do for you ? __eou__ Hello . I'm sorry to tell you that I've lost my credit card this morning . I want to report the loss and replace a card . __eou__ Don't worry . I will help you soon . Please fill in this form first . And write down your name , your account number and the amount in your card please . __eou__ Done ! __eou__ OK . May I see your ID card ? ( B passed his ID card . ) Please wait for a moment . Let me go and check the account . ( A few minutes later . ) We have locked your card . You can come here to renew the account and get a new card a week later . Your money will not be lost . __eou__ Thank goodness . __eou__ Please pay 10 yuan , the handling charge . __eou__ OK ! Thank you very much . See you a week later . __eou__ See you ! __eou__
I'm glad we came here . This is really delicious ! __eou__ I was worried you would think it was too far to drive . __eou__ Well , it's true I've never driven two hours just to get lunch.But really , I think it's worth it . __eou__ I think if you try some more authentic Chinese food , you might understand how we students from Taiwan suffer . __eou__ How do you mean " suffer " ? __eou__ I mean , in Milwaukee there is no good Chinese food.So we miss the food in Taiwan too much.Sometimes we just have to drive down here to Chicago to find something better . __eou__ Even in the winter ? __eou__ Yes , even in the winter . __eou__ And even if it takes two hours , huh ? __eou__ Why not ? I've been craving good food for three weeks now . I'm too sick of hamburgers and pizza ! __eou__ Well , this really is delicious , I have to admit . I can understand better now why you and your friends are always whining . __eou__ Don't tease me ! Good food is really important to Chinese ! __eou__ I know . I can see that . This is what is called " dim sum , " right ? __eou__ Yes , all these dishes are different " dim sum " dishes.You can't find this kind of thing except for in a few cities in America . __eou__ So when you Chinese think of Chinatown , you mostly think of food . Is that right ? __eou__ Of course . I will try to buy some things at the Asian grocery down the block too.Then I can do a little cooking in my apartment . __eou__ And maybe we can go to a good Italian restaurant for dinner , after the museum.Chicago has some great Italian restaurants . __eou__ No way ! __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ We're going up to the " new " Chinatown for dinner . I already know where we're going to go . __eou__ Alright , alright . I am happy to try more Chinese food.Will it be dim sum again ? __eou__ No , dim sum is usually eaten around lunch time , or sometimes closer to breakfast.We ' ll try more Taiwanese style up at the " new " Chinatown . __eou__ Taiwanese style ? Isn't dim sum Taiwanese style ? __eou__ No , dim sum is more Cantonese style.But of course you can buy it in Taiwan . __eou__ I wonder if you can cook things this good . __eou__ I'm a great cook actually . You will see . __eou__
Hey , Jenny . Would you like to go to dinner with me ? __eou__ I don't know . You know what they say about office romances . __eou__ No , I don't . What do they say about office romances ? __eou__ They say you shouldn't mix love and work . __eou__ That's silly . What I do on my own time is no one else ’ s business . Besides , it's pretty hard to meet people outside of the office when we spend long hours here . __eou__ You ’ Ve got a point . Once I dated one of my supervisors and all of my co-workers accused him of favoritism . Then when the relationship went bad , he fired me . __eou__ People fall in love with people they work with . That's a fact . __eou__ That may be true , but I don't want an inter-office relationship to affect my productivity . __eou__ If it does , it will only make you more productive , because we can support each other . __eou__ You are sounding like we are already married . __eou__ Good grief . All I did was ask you out . I am sorry . __eou__ Well , I don't feel right about it . __eou__ I am talking about dinner tonight , not a lifetime . __eou__ Most starts with dinner , but then it gets out of hand . Besides , haven't you asked out every woman in the entire office ? __eou__ I like company . __eou__ Company ? I heard about you from Linda . She said you were an octopus ! __eou__ What can I say ? I am a passionate guy . __eou__ Well , I hope you can find something else to be passionate about . __eou__ You want to go out with me and you know it . __eou__ In your dreams . Now if you don't mind , I've got some work to do . __eou__ Ok , I get the message . Hey , do you have any sisters ? __eou__
Why do you want to eat western food so much today ? Anything special to celebrate ? Did you get a promotion ? __eou__ Honey , you really forgot about it ? Think it over . It's a candlelight dinner . __eou__ It's not your birthday , also not mine . Hey , come on . Just tell me . __eou__ It's our wedding anniversary , honey . How can you forget about it ? __eou__ My dear , tomorrow is our wedding anniversary . We've been together for 20 years . But you never change . Always so careless ! Do you remember the thing that happened on our wedding day ? __eou__ Of course . I almost missed my own wedding . __eou__ Yeah . Do you know that this restaurant used to be the teahouse where we first met ? __eou__ Oh , really ! It looks so different . Our old place turns into a brand new place . __eou__ Do you remember our first date ? I got a really special gift . __eou__ I can never forget that . I bought you five candies , but I was so anxious that I forgot to give them to you . You didn't get them until we parted . Then they had already melted down for I held them the whole time . __eou__ Yeah , it's really unforgettable . Thank you for making me happy all these years . __eou__ You are the one I should thank . You've done really great job . __eou__
I don't know what I'm going to do . I need to find a job . If I don't , I won't be able to stay here next semester . __eou__ Have you tried university part-time jobs ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I mean in the library , or in some information center.Often the university hires foreign students for part-time positions . __eou__ Yes , I know . I tried that.They don't have anything now . So what can I do ? __eou__ Well , since you're a foreign student , it's hard.That ' s because it's actually illegal for you to work in America . __eou__ I know that . You don't have to tell me that . That's my problem . I know I have the right to work for the university . That's legal.But they don't have a job for me . And it's illegal for me to get a job elsewhere . __eou__ Anyway , there must be some solution.You know there are many people working illegally in New York . __eou__ But I need a pretty decent job . I need to make enough to pay my rent at least . __eou__ I have an idea . __eou__ What ? __eou__ Since you're Chinese , maybe you can find part-time work in Chinatown . __eou__ I already had that idea . __eou__ Well , why don't you go and look down there ? __eou__ But I don't know what I would do . __eou__ It may be part-time work as a waitress or something.It would be illegal , but sometimes waitresses make a good salary . __eou__ Maybe . I don't know . __eou__ I will ask my friends for you.Maybe someone knows a company that needs part-time people.That ' s another thing you should do . Ask all your friends to ask around for you.You might find something . __eou__ I have to find something.Otherwise I have to go back to Taiwan . I'll be broke in two months . __eou__
Matthew , do you know much about body language in countries around the world ? __eou__ Sure , I've picked up a few things from travelling around for work . Why ? __eou__ Well , I had a meeting today with a woman from Japan and she wouldn't stop bowing ! I didn't know what to do ! __eou__ Did you bow back ? __eou__ No , I tried to shake her hand , but her hand was so limp I was a bit offended . __eou__ Well , Japanese businessmen and women typically bow to greet each other in Japan . She might have been offended by your strong handshake . __eou__ But she was in America ! Shouldn't she have known that strong handshakes in America signify confidence and respect ? __eou__ Things are different in Japan . You know , in some countries , making eye contact with others is considered rude . __eou__ Is that why she wouldn ’ t look at me in the meeting ? __eou__ I think it's highly possible , yes . __eou__ The meeting really didn ’ t go down well at all . I think I need to read up about intercultural communication before I have another meeting with someone from another country . __eou__ That's a good idea . When you don ’ t know much about other cultures , the simplest thing can offend someone . __eou__ That's so true . It's great that we see eye to eye on this . __eou__
How do you think people get their personalities ? __eou__ I think it ’ s mainly from the environment a person lives in . __eou__ Don ’ t you think people get their personalities from their parents ? __eou__ No , but parents control a lot of the environment that kids grow up in , so they certainly influence their kids ' personalities a lot . __eou__ So why do you think many kids have personalities that are so different from their parents . __eou__ Maybe when they become teenagers , they want to be completely different to their parents . __eou__ You might be right . I guess most parents want their kids to be like them , but kids today grow up in a different environment . You know , they know much more about the world from the internet , newspapers , and tv . __eou__ Do you think that teenagers get a lot of their bad behaviour from tv and movies ? __eou__ Maybe some of it . I think a lot of people blame TV and movies when the real problem is that the parents aren ’ t bringing their child up correctly . __eou__ Parents have a difficult job . They have to bring up their children and usually have to work too . __eou__ Yes , that ’ s true . Your son is doing well at school , isn ’ t he ? __eou__ Yes , he is . He ’ s very hardworking when he ’ s at school . Then he comes home from school and does homework before dinner . After dinner , he goes out with his friends . __eou__ So , he ’ s not a bookworm ? It ’ s good that he has an outgoing personality . Some kids are very quiet and introverted . You wonder they ’ ll survive in the real world without their parents to support them . __eou__
why are you in such a good mood today ? __eou__ well , yesterday , I decided to face my fear of heights . __eou__ I didn't know you were scared of heights ! Was it really bad ? __eou__ let me put it this way . I've never seen a professional sorts game in a stadium because I could never get myself to walk to the top of the stairs to sit down . __eou__ so what did you do about it yesterday ? __eou__ I went sky-diving ! __eou__ you're kidding me ! that sounds really scary ! __eou__ It was scary , but it felt great , too . __eou__ weren't you scared ? __eou__ of course I was scared . But I had an instructor that went with me and that helped . __eou__ so have you cured your fear of heights ? __eou__ I think so . After I jumped out of the plane , I realized that I should just enjoy life . Worrying about it or not doing things out of fear is just plain silly . __eou__ I'm impressed . __eou__ are you scared of anything ? __eou__ well , sometimes I get scared when I'm in my apartment all by myself . __eou__ what do you think is going to happen ? __eou__ I always worry that the door is unlocked or that a window is open and that a stranger will come in and steal my things . __eou__ it sounds like you just need to be more careful . __eou__
What is your greatest strength ? __eou__ I think I am very good at planning . I manage my time well so that I can always get things done on time . __eou__ What is your weakness ? __eou__ I always give each job my best efforts , so when others are not pulling their weight , I am frustrated . __eou__ What is your greatest accomplishment ? __eou__ I got the Scientific Research Prize from the Gansu government for my achievements in the Northwest Regional Economy Development Research Project . __eou__ Can you work under pressure ? __eou__ Working under pressure is exciting and challenging . I don ’ t mind . In fact , I am very efficient when certain pressure is exerted on the work . __eou__ What are the problems you have encountered in your job and how do you solve them ? __eou__ There was a time when both the clerical assistant and the secretary resigned at the same time . I then had to handle their work temporarily . The workload was incredibly heavy . So I started to set priorities for the jobs and hired part-time staff to handle routine work . Finally , I managed to keep the operation smooth until we found someone to fill the vacancy . __eou__ How do you deal with those who you think are difficult to work with ? __eou__ I stick to my principles and keep to the rules . Sometimes , they just lack enthusiasm and I get them involved with something constructive . Some of them change their attitude later . __eou__
Hello , Dana Okro . __eou__ Hello , Dana , this is Kevin Abrahams from Eureka Corp . I don't know if you'll remember me but we met last week at the Chamber of Commerce luncheon . __eou__ Oh , yes . Hi , how are you ? __eou__ Great . Do you have a few minutes right now for me to tell you a little bit more about the data management tools our company has to offer ? It won't take long . __eou__ Actually , I'm really swamped right now and I'll be going into a meeting in a few minutes . Is there any literature you can send me ? __eou__ Oh , sure , I understand . I'd be happy to send you a promotional packet about the programs that I think might best suit a company of your size . Would it be okay if I called again to see if you have any questions ? __eou__ Let's do this . Since I'm not sure when I'll get a chance to read the material , why don't I give you a call if I have any questions . Now , I'm really sorry , but I have to get going to this meeting . __eou__ No problem at all . I won't keep you any longer . I'll put a package to you in the mail and we'll go from there . __eou__ Sounds good . __eou__ Thanks for your time . __eou__ No problem . Bye , bye . __eou__
Hello , Mr.Green . This is Lin Tong . How are you ? __eou__ Hi , Mr.Lin . I am leaving tomorrow and I am just packing . __eou__ Oh , sorry to interrupt you . But I am calling to say goodbye to you . I am awfully sorry to tell you that I am afraid I could not see you off at the airport tomorrow , because I will have to attend a very important meeting . __eou__ It doesn't matter , Mr.Lin . I can understand . I know you are always very busy . Work must come first . __eou__ Thanks a lot . You have been here for almost three weeks . How time flies ! __eou__ Yes . And I would like to convey my thanks to you for your help during my stay here in Nanjing . __eou__ It is our pleasure . It has been a great pleasure to work with you . __eou__ Me too . I am looking forward to cooperating with you again . __eou__ Really ? Great ! We will . Well , what's your flight number ? When are you leaving tomorrow ? __eou__ It's Flight No . 104 , Northey Airlines , which leaves at ten O'dock tomorrow evening . __eou__ OK , I will send someone to see you off . __eou__ That is so thoughtful of you . __eou__ My pleasure . Take care and have a nice trip . __eou__ Thanks a lot . My wife and I will be welcoming and looking forward to your visit . __eou__ Let's call it a deal . Hope to see you again soon . Keep in touch then . Byebye . __eou__ Goodbye . Thanks again . __eou__
How time flies ! We have been in Beijing for almost 4 years . __eou__ yes , I can still recall the days when we were all seniors at college . I asked you whether you would go back to your hometown or not . __eou__ yeah , feels like yesterday . Now I ’ m almost settled down here . We ’ re planning to buy an apartment and tie the knot . __eou__ congratulations ! I hope when you hold the wedding ceremony , I ’ m still residing in Beijing . __eou__ thank you . Is your company going to move to other cities ? __eou__ no , I ’ m planning to quit this job and go back to work in my hometown after the spring festival . __eou__ why is that ? __eou__ well , I still can ’ t adjust to the fast pace of city life . __eou__ yeah , the hustle and bustle is really difficult to handle . __eou__ that ’ s right . I work extremely hard , and try my best to adapt to the lifestyle here , but I don ’ t feel any sense of belonging here . __eou__ I understand your position . Perhaps it ’ s time to stop floating and go back to where you belong . You ’ ll feel much better with your family around . __eou__ yeah , I think so . __eou__
So , tell me , what makes you think we should give you a raise ? __eou__ I've got several good reasons . I've been here several years , my work has proven to be good , and I've noticed that people in comparable jobs get paid more than I do . __eou__ Salaries are confidential , how do you know how much money these " other people " make ? __eou__ Well , I've noticed all the new cars around here , for one thing . __eou__ Those are company cars provided to the sales staff for their business trips . Also , some employees receive sales commissions . So good salesmen will naturally earn more . __eou__ That's understandable . Well , rather than comparing my salary with someone else's , perhaps we could talk about my job performance . Surely you've noticed the extra hours I've put in recently ? __eou__ I see your point . However , it might be hard to get a raise approved . Profits were down last quarter , and the whole company is tightening its belt , so anything that affects the annual budget __eou__ That would be very good of you , Mr . White . __eou__
Let's go to Burger Queen for lunch . They have good cheese burgers . __eou__ OK . I am hungry , too . I like their milkshake . They're very creamy and tasty . __eou__ Look at the long line , there are always a lot of people waiting in lines just for the cheese burger . It must be very delicious . __eou__ Yup . But , this also means we have to wait to order our food . __eou__ Come on . It is worth waiting . Their cheese burgers are really popular . Once you have it , you will love it . __eou__ Well , sounds very attractive . I just tried their vanilla milkshake last time , and it was really delicious . __eou__ Yup , they have good French fries as well . Not very thick , but crispy enough . You should try them with some mayonnaise sauce . That is the Belgium style . You will love it . __eou__ OK , I think I know what to order for my lunch now . But , eating too much fried food really makes me fat . __eou__ Come on . You just have it once in a while , not every day . It will not harm you . __eou__ That's true . You can hear my tummy grumbling . I am really hungry ! __eou__ Be patient . Good food never comes fast . __eou__ Ok ! __eou__
Hello , Jason . Are you free this Saturday evening ? __eou__ Yes . I have no plans . __eou__ Would you like to Come to our barbecue ? __eou__ Yes , that sounds wonderful . __eou__ OK . See you then . __eou__ But wait , wait , will there be food that is not meat ? You know . I'm a vegetarian __eou__ Hey ! I didn't know that ! When did you become a vegetarian ? __eou__ The other day , I decided that I needed to loose more weight so I am going to try to be a vegetarian . And you know what ? I don't miss the taste of meat . __eou__ Relly ? That's amazing . __eou__ Yes , it really is . After having vegetarian diet . I have much more energy , I need less sleep , I feel calmer . I can maintain an ideal body weight without worrying about how much I eat and I can think more clearly . __eou__ Are you kidding ? I really don't think that you think less clearly on non-vegetarian diet . __eou__ Yes , maybe . But I feel better since becoming a vegetarian . Maybe you could also have a try . __eou__ Maybe I'll also have a try some day , but I'm afraid that it would be difficult for me to refuse meat . __eou__ Maybe you would change your mind after having a vegetarian diet . __eou__ We'll see . Anyway , I'll prepare some vegetarian food for the barbecue . See you then ! __eou__
I just got a call from Mrs . Fitzgerald . See what your Willie has just done . __eou__ My Willie ? Why has he suddenly become my Willie ? __eou__ Because he takes after you , he's got into trouble again . __eou__ What did he do this time ? I remember last time he was painting her fence to repay her for breaking it , and he accidentally painted her cat . __eou__ That was last time . This time it's worse . __eou__ Ok , tell me . __eou__ Well , he was playing baseball with some friends ... __eou__ And the ball went through her window ? That's not as bad as last time . __eou__ True , but that's not all . The ball went through the window and hit the vase she has in her front window ... __eou__ Ok , that's probably expensive , but not that bad . __eou__ And then , ricocheted off her fish bowl . Mrs . Fitzgerald at the last minute dived and saved her fish . __eou__ At least the fish were saved . If that's the end of the damages , then everything isn't that bad . __eou__ Stop interrupting me . Finally , the ball flew through the air and knocked out Willie's school principal , who was having a cup of coffee with Mrs . Fitzgerald . __eou__ Hmm , that is bad . __eou__
Sis , why did you ask me to come to this bargain market ? It's so crowded , and you can't find anything that you really want . __eou__ You just don't get it . Looking for bargains can be really interesting . __eou__ Are you serious ? How can that be ? __eou__ Bargaining is a game , or even a battle . You feel like a winner when you get a good price . __eou__ Come on . You know , you can never really win . The salesperson never loses . They make their living out of it . __eou__ That's true . But I just love it . Come here ! __eou__ Oh , this silk carpet is really beautiful . Look at the pattern , and how delicate it is ! __eou__ You do have great taste . That's the most expensive stuff here . __eou__ Really ? Oh , this one . I like the cloisonn vase . __eou__ Are you kidding me ? I bought a same one last week . It's surprising that there is something we both like . Well , what do you think of these ceramic cups ? __eou__ Come on . They look so cheap . Something else , please . __eou__ What about this picture ? I think Benjamin would like it . __eou__ Don't underestimate his taste . I don't think he'd like it . __eou__ Don't be so sure . He loves the vase I bought here last week . __eou__ Yeah . Well , anyway , it's up to you . But I can tell that you come here often . __eou__ Absolutely . That's why I can always get a good price . __eou__
Hey John , did you register for classes yet ? __eou__ I register this Friday . __eou__ What classes do you plan on taking ? __eou__ I really want to take the communication class , but I don't know if it will be available . __eou__ Is that class really that popular ? __eou__ Yeah . I tried to get in last semester , but it was full by the time I registered . __eou__ What other classes are you going to take ? __eou__ I still need to take English 201 , but I really don't like writing . __eou__ I took that class already . There is a lot of writing , but it's not that bad . __eou__ Oh really ? Who was the instructor ? There are like 4 different instructors to choose from . __eou__ I had Professor Mahoney . __eou__ Is he an easy grader ? __eou__ I'm not sure if he is or not , but I thought he was definitely fair . __eou__ Do you mind if I ask you what you got ? __eou__ Not at all . I got a 3.8 . __eou__ Well , what did you get in English 101 last year ? __eou__ I got a 4.0 in that class . __eou__ Well , I can't compare to you . I got a 3.1 in English 101 . That means if you got a lower grade in English 201 , it must be harder . __eou__ It's not what it appears . I actually tried harder in the 101 class . If I put as much effort into the 201 class , I would have received the same grade . __eou__ Oh . That helps . Thanks . __eou__
hello ! How are you today ? __eou__ hi . I ’ m feeling very nervous . I just had a test and I ’ m not sure how well or how badly I did . __eou__ it ’ s not use worrying about it now . you ’ Ve done test and you can ’ t change any of your answers . __eou__ that ’ s true . I really should go home and prepare for the next test , but I ’ m feeling tired . __eou__ let ’ s go and get a coffee together . That will help you to wake up again ! __eou__ ok . I feel like sitting down and having a chat . How have you been recently ? __eou__ oh , you know me . I ’ m always happy ! If I think I ’ m getting into a bad mood , I call some friends and socialize or have a chat . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . I usually just sit at home alone and get increasingly moody . __eou__ I hate spending too much time at home . I get bored of it really quickly . I ’ m always excited about going out to party or other social event and meeting people . __eou__ perhaps I ’ m being too shy . I should go out more too and not spend time worrying about tests ! __eou__
Hello , is it necessary to do warm-up exercise ? I can't wait to dive into the water . __eou__ I'm sorry . Every customer coming here must do the warm-up exercise before getting down to swimming . That's out regulation . __eou__ Yeah , I see . You are just doing your job . But I wanna know what the advantages it has . __eou__ OK , lovely boy . Try to be patient . Do you know the danger of swimming without warm-up ? __eou__ As far as I know , people will be weak if they swim too long . __eou__ That's right . But the most dangerous thing is that their legs may spasm out of control when swimming . __eou__ Is it very dangerous ? I'm a little scared . Do you offer the lifebuoy for us ? __eou__ Yes , besides that , we also provide our customers with goggles , swimming suit and something like that . __eou__ Do you have the workers to save me if anything should happen ? __eou__ Of course , all the workers here are able to swim , and they will come to your aid quickly . __eou__
Hello , let me introduce myself . I'm your neighbor . My name is Shirley . __eou__ Hi , Shirley . I'm Sophie . It's nice to meet you . __eou__ Nice to meet you , too . __eou__ Please come in . __eou__ Here is a little gift for your family . It's a calendar with all the community events on it . I hope it can be helpful . __eou__ I really appreciate it . __eou__ Since we are neighbors , if you need any help or anything , please come to me . __eou__ I will . Actually , I am worried so much about the security of this community because my house has been burgled twice before . __eou__ Oh , don't worry about that here . There are security guards on duty 24 hours a day and they patrol all over the neighborhood . You know , they are all very strong . __eou__ Really ? That's good . Is there any supermarket in our neighborhood ? __eou__ Of course . There is a Carrefour near the neighborhood . I'll show you there if you want to . __eou__ That's terrific ! __eou__ By the way , a party will be held for new neighbors the day after tomorrow . I hope I can see you there . __eou__ Yeah , and we can get to know each other at the party . __eou__
How do you feel about wearing name logos or slogans on your clothing ? __eou__ I've never really thought about it before . I guess it doesn't bother me . __eou__ Do you think advertising has an influence on the choices you make when you're shopping ? __eou__ I guess so . I usually buy name-brand clothing , shoes , and electronic goods . How about you ? __eou__ I actually try to avoid name-brand items . I can't stand it when big companies advertise their products all over the place ! __eou__ I know that advertisers are experts at persuading people to spend their money , I think brilliant items are usually higher quality than ~ grounds . __eou__ I think is sensible to buy products that is high quality than others when you want to buy something that's going to last a long time , but I don't think it always makes sense . __eou__ Do you have a brand preference for anything ? __eou__ I do for shower items like shower gel and shampoo , but I don't for higher-end items . __eou__ What do you think about the " impossible is nothing " billboard on the high street ? __eou__ It's just a slogan for a famous company ; there's nothing really special about it . __eou__ I think it's a brilliant advert ! It really grabs my attention ! __eou__ To each their own ! __eou__
this party rocks ! __eou__ you said it . Good beer , good music , and on top of that , there are so many hot girls here ! __eou__ I'm with you on that . Check out that one over there . I think I'm in love ! __eou__ well , she's alright , but not really my cup of tea . What about the blond with the red dress ? __eou__ oh , that's Janice . She's just new in town . You have a thing for blonds , eh ? __eou__ yeah ! She could do anything she wants to me ! __eou__ I bet . Why not go over and talk to her ? She's really nice . __eou__ I don't think so . I get so nervous talking to girls . I always put my foot in my mouth , scare her off , and end up looking like a real fool . Besides , she is way out of my league . __eou__ come on ! Man up ! You'll never know until you try . __eou__ okay okay , just let me have another cup of beers to get my head in the game . __eou__ all right . But I think you ought to move soon . __eou__ why ? __eou__ I can see five other guys eying her up . __eou__ okay , here I go ! __eou__ good luck ! __eou__
Hi , sir . Could you tell me where the Hilton Hotel is ? __eou__ Well , there are two Hilton Hotels around here . Which one is your destination ? __eou__ Eh , let me see . Sorry , I can't remember it , because I've been there only once , accompanied by my friends . __eou__ Then , it would be a little bit harder to find out your way . Do you remember the name of the street , or one or two landmarks ? __eou__ A bookstore , probably . With a yellow and orange logo . __eou__ Good , any other clues ? __eou__ I remembered there is a very busy street several miles away . I waited for the traffic light for a very long time . __eou__ Oh , is there a bank near there , Standard Charted possibly ? __eou__ Oh , yeah , I got it , there is a bank My friend exchanged her money there . __eou__ That's the second branch hotel of Hilton . Walk straight down and you will see the bookstore you just mentioned . Turn left , I believe , you will get it . __eou__ Great ! Many thanks ! __eou__
Welcome to Lincoln Bank . Are you a new customer ? __eou__ Yes , I am . I opened an account with you about a month ago , but today I'm here to see about a loan of some kind . __eou__ I see . As you don't have a long history with us , we will have to check your credit rating with your previous bank before we can promise any loan to you . __eou__ Yes , that's fine . My credit is good ; I banked at my former bank for many years . __eou__ May I ask why you decided to switch your account to us ? __eou__ Haha ! Actually , I felt that your array of services is much better than what my old bank had on offer . Plus , I've got plenty of friends who bank with you and they are extremely happy . __eou__ We always welcome new business . If you can give me the details of your former bank , including your account number we can begin . __eou__ I have everything right here . I'll let you go through that and come back . I'd like to have a good read of your materials to make sure I make the right choice . __eou__
I am afraid I have some bad news for you . It's about our order contract O5TSWAL . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ The goods arrived half a month later than scheduled . What's more , five cases were found broken and unit inside seriously damaged . __eou__ Really ? That's something unexpected . You see , all our exports were strictly inspected before shipment . The goods were in perfect condition when they left . __eou__ But then there were some cracks in a number of cases . Almost all the bottom of the cases were loose . __eou__ That could have happened in the course of transit or unloading , due to rough handling . __eou__ But our surveyors found the damage was caused by poor packing . __eou__ But there is nothing wrong with our packing . Our cartons are standard export ones and we also enforced them with straps . __eou__ But you filled the cartons too full and the straps are not strong enough . When they were rehandled , some of them were broken . __eou__ I don't think the stevedores could have handled them with great care . __eou__
I want to ask you for a favor . I want to rent an apartment here in Beijing , but as a foreigner , I don't know the normal practice . Can you give me some advice ? __eou__ First , why don't you tell me what you need , such as how big a room , where you want to live , whether you want to live downtown , and what you like to do . Then I can figure out which apartment is most suitable for you . __eou__ I am a student and want to live in Haitian , so that I can live close to my school . I like to play soccer and I like a quiet apartment so I can study . __eou__ I think that an apartment with two rooms and a kitchen would suit your needs . I can introduce you to a place for rent near your school . The apartment is on the 7th floor , so it is very quiet and suitable for studying . __eou__ That sounds great ! __eou__ You can also go to the school's sports field to play soccer , and if you're lucky you might make some Chinese friends there . It is right near the market and has comfortable facilities . __eou__ Thank you so much . That's very kind of you . __eou__
I have found it quite different here from China since I came to the United States . __eou__ What's the difference ? __eou__ Some friends of mine took me to the mall to go shopping . It was so big . I think I could get lost if I went there alone . __eou__ You must have bought many things in the mall ? __eou__ Not really many . I was told that on weekends there were always the flea markets , so I decided to come to the flea market to buy a bargain . __eou__ It's wise to do it . The Americans have the habit of selling their junk when they are moving to another place , so they usually display all the things they want to sell in their gardens at the weekend . And many things they are selling still look quite new and they are also very useful . __eou__ I have heard about it while in China . it is called a " yard sale " . I didn't have any idea of that until today when I came here to the big " yard sale " . __eou__ You must have got many useful things for your new apartment . __eou__
Excuse me , Ma ' am . I would like to mail this package door to door via airmail to London . It is a very important package and has to be sent within 3 days . __eou__ No problem . But , the postage is much higher than the regular package . __eou__ That's fine with me . I am willing to pay for it as long as you can guarantee me the package can arrive in time . __eou__ OK . All the registered airmail packages can be received in 5 working days . __eou__ I see . How much do I need to pay in total for this package ? __eou__ It's 500 dollars . __eou__ Can I have the receipt ? Just in case I can trace it if something goes wrong . __eou__ Sure ! Please just fill in your I . D . number and ways to contact you here . __eou__ Do I need to include my zip code in the address ? __eou__ You had better include that because it is easier for the mailmen to find the correct mailing address . __eou__ Thank you very much . Here is 500 dollars . __eou__ Here is your receipt . Contact us if your friend still doesn't receive the package after 5 work days . __eou__
Who's that man over there talking to James ? __eou__ Where ? Oh , that's Henry . __eou__ He's very handsome , isn't he ? What's he like ? __eou__ He's very nice , actually , but rather eccentric . __eou__ Really ? I love eccentric people . __eou__ Yes , but he may be too eccentric even for you . __eou__ Why ? What do you mean by that ? __eou__ Well , haven't you heard ? __eou__ Heard what ? No one ever tells me anything . __eou__ Well , apparently , he's been having an affair with his secretary . __eou__ Really ! How fascinating . __eou__ According to Mary , he's divorcing his wife and there's a big fight going on about the children . I thought everyone knew . __eou__ Well , what can I say ? I didn't know . Oh , I meant to tell you earlier , your blouse doesn't really match your skirt . Those colors don't really suit you either . __eou__ Oh . Thanks . Look , I must just go and say hello to someone . I'll be right back . __eou__
Who's that tall guy over there ? __eou__ Oh , that's George . He looks very drunk . __eou__ What's he like normally ? __eou__ Oh , he's really reserved , normally . But , from what I hear , he's got lots of problems . __eou__ Really ? What kind of problems ? __eou__ Well , off the record , of course , but I hear that he's got terrible debts . He has his own company , and it's not going very well . __eou__ Really ? Well , I hate to say this , but I'm not surprised . __eou__ Really ? What makes you say that ? __eou__ Well , he doesn't look very honest . __eou__ I know , that's the problem . He can't find any customers . It's a pity , really , because his products are very good . Oh , that reminds me . Did I tell you about my new laptop ? __eou__ Oh , don't talk to me about laptops . Mine crashed on Friday and I lost everything . I hate them . __eou__ Oh , really ? __eou__ Look , I need another drink . Do you want one ? __eou__ Yes , I'll have another cocktail . __eou__ Vodka martini ? __eou__ Absolutely . __eou__ I'll be back in a sec . __eou__ OK . I'll wait here for you . __eou__
So , how's your work ? __eou__ Good . How about you ? __eou__ I am going to resign . A few of the new staff have already left . Obviously , a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries . __eou__ But your company is huge . Can't they afford to pay the staff decent wages . __eou__ But we have a policy of paying according to seniority in the company , so new employees get quite low salary , no matter how excellent they have done . __eou__ That's shortsighted . By the time the workers are experienced and contributing . They are likely to go . __eou__ That's why I am going to leave . __eou__ But you have already worked there for five years . __eou__ I am worried about my future . I can't believe that our company is as big as it is . The company can only continue to grow by taking care of its staff . __eou__ Well . The management doesn't seem to think that way . Anyways , you have to think twice before you act . __eou__ Thank you . I will . __eou__

Oh , no , I feel like such a loser . __eou__ Hey , she is not worth it . Forget her . __eou__ But she lied to me . __eou__ Hey , she is not worth it . Anyway , there are plenty more fish in the sea . Listen , let's go for a drink in the town . How about that ? __eou__ Ok , then . __eou__ But you have to promise me that you are not gonna wear that face . __eou__ What face ? __eou__ The one where you look like your dog just died . You have to get over her and the sooner the better . __eou__ Yeah , I know . You are right . __eou__

Most nights I sit at home and watch telly __eou__ Do you know what's on tonight by any chance ? __eou__ No , I'm sorry I don't . I never read the papers till I get home . __eou__ Oh , I see . By the way , where are you going for your holidays this year ? __eou__ I don't know yet . My wife's going to her mother's for a couple of weeks . She Livesay the sea , you know . __eou__ Oh , does she ? That's convenient . __eou__ Yes , but I want to go to the country . __eou__ Don't you like the sea ? __eou__ Yes , very much . But I need peace and quiet when I'm on holiday . What are coughing to do ? __eou__ I'm going to stay at home . __eou__ Aren't you going to have a holiday abroad this year ? __eou__ No , I want to buy a car , and that's going to take every penny I've got . __eou__
Good afternoon , is there a vacant room here ? __eou__ We are practically full up , but I will see . What do you want , a single room or a double one ? __eou__ A single room , preferably with a bath . __eou__ How long do you plan to stay ? __eou__ For a week or so . __eou__ You can have a room on the second floor . __eou__ I hope it's quiet . I hate noise at night . __eou__ I think you will find it quiet .

What position have you held before ? __eou__ I have been a salesman . __eou__ Would you tell me the general description of your present job ? __eou__ I am in charge of the trading department . __eou__ What made you decide to change your job ? __eou__ I ’ m working in a small company where further promotion is impossible . __eou__ Why do you leave your present company ? __eou__ I never easily give up something that is valuable . Before I decided to quit that position , I had made a thorough analysis of things like what I would gain and what I would lose here in your company . You know , Shanghai is always a fascinating place to me , full of challenges as well as hopes . In addition to this , I have the specialized knowledge and the necessary experience of making a good . Of course , opportunities to work abroad and a higher salary are also important to me . So I believe it ’ s worthwhile to come here to work . __eou__ Why did you pick this organization ? __eou__ I'm very much interested in the position . __eou__ What made you decide to join our company ? __eou__ I believe I would have better opportunities with a small but rapidly expanding company like yours . __eou__
What's the price ? I hope you'll quote us favorably . __eou__ It's 800 US dollars per kilo CIF five percent Hamburg . __eou__ Frankly speaking , the price you offer is too high . We can't accept it . __eou__ Why ? This is a fair market price . __eou__ It certainly is . __eou__ Then what leads you to think that we have to reduce our price ? Please tell me candidly . __eou__ I look at it this way , suppliers should be able to reduce their CIF price , even lower than their home price . __eou__ We give you quotations on the same basis as we quote in the domestic market . __eou__ That's the point . Your overhead is in your domestic price , but it can't be carried in the CIF price . __eou__ But even with the overhead out , the export overhead must be put in . Finally , it comes to the same thing . Anyway , this is a quality item and should be sold on its value . __eou__ I wish you could make a reconsideration . If you don't reduce your price , we won't purchase from you any more because there's plenty of other business offering here . __eou__

Do you mind if we look in your suitcase ? __eou__ Not at all . Go right ahead . __eou__ What ’ s this sir ? __eou__ It ’ s traditional Chinese Medicine . I mix it with hot water like tea . Sorry . I forgot about it . __eou__ What are these red things sir ? __eou__ Oh no ! I forgot about those too ! Those are Chinese sausages for my Aunt Lily . __eou__ I ’ m sorry sir , but you can ’ t take any of this into the country . We will also have to check your carry-on . Please step this way . Don ’ t ’ be nervous ; we ’ ll just look through it briefly and then __eou__

Several people have suggested that I get more yellow clothes . They say the color suits me because I have a fair complexion . __eou__ That's right . You know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . Actually , I think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion .

For example , black could make you look mature , while pink could make you look young and energetic . __eou__ Thank you for your compliments . It sounds like you're a clothing expert . __eou__ Well , compared with my wife , I'm just a beginner . __eou__

Baloney ! That movie was made on a shoestring budget . They've been using trick photography like that for years __eou__ Okay .

Where do you think we should go on holiday this summer ? __eou__ We , I ’ d like to go to Australia . I know it ’ s far to go , but I think it would be something different and special . __eou__ I ’ d really like to go to the Caribbean . We can relax on the beached and enjoy the sunshine . __eou__ There are beaches in Australia too , but I would prefer a more active holiday this year . We could visit Ayers rock and the great barrier reef . It would be so exciting . __eou__ But would it be relaxing ? By summer . I ’ ll be quite tired from doing so much work . The last thing I need is to use more energy racing around Australia . I ’ d need another holiday to recover from the holiday ! __eou__ Oh , come on ! A tour of Australia would be relaxing because you ’ d be doing something different and not working . __eou__ Do you think so ? I ’ m not so sure . Anyway , tell me your plans for an Australian holiday . How long do you think we should spend there ? __eou__ I think we should go for two weeks . We could spend a week in the bush and a week at the great barrier reef-including a few day on the beach for tired office workers ! __eou__ That doesn ’ t sound too bad . I ’ d certainly like to go diving . That ’ s one reason I wanted to go to the Caribbean . __eou__ We could hire a car and travel around the interior of Australia for several days . If we hire a car , we can go where we like . __eou__ We ’ d have to plan our drive before we leave . Let ’ s get a good guidebook from the bookstore when we go shopping in town tomorrow . __eou__ It looks like I might have convinced you to go to Australia ! __eou__

Tell me something about yourself and your past . __eou__ I was born and grew up in hebes Province . I moved to Beijing , where I started taking courses for my MBA . When I completed my degree , I was offered an opportunity working for a financial services company . I've worked there for eight years . __eou__ What was the most significant project you've worked on ? __eou__ I was assigned a project to design a 360 - degree performance system . It was a challenge for a person with a finance background . I met with the technical people and discussed the possibilities and obstacles . Based on that information , I selected a team and created a spreadsheet to manage the project . We got the project done on schedule . I was rewarded for outstanding results and was able to share the honors with the team . __eou__ What finance experience makes you qualified for this position ? __eou__ For the past eight years , I have been working in the banking industry . I have a solid understanding of accounting concepts , an analytical mind and a strong attention to detail . I've had a lot of customer service training and experience , and I have been told that I excel in this area . __eou__ How would your coworkers evaluate you ? __eou__ They'd say I was a handworker and a real team player . __eou__ What are your salary expectations ? __eou__ I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . I'd like to postpone that decision until later . __eou__
What did you buy at the market ? __eou__ I bought some special local products . __eou__ You seem to have bought the whole market ! __eou__ Yes . I really wanted to do so . I love those handicrafts , especially the paper-cut . __eou__ Paper-cuts are all hand-made . Let me see the paper-cuts you bought . They are all animals . __eou__ Aren't animals the main content of Chinese paper-cuts ? __eou__ All right . Animals , especially Chinese zodiac , are the most common theme in paper-cuts . But there are other themes . __eou__ Then I will buy some tomorrow . __eou__ Why do you want to buy so much ? __eou__ Because I want to send them to my friends . __eou__ I see . __eou__
It's especially cold when the wind is blowing . __eou__ Why don't you wear a scarf ? __eou__ What can wearing one do for me ? __eou__ You're cold because the wind is blowing into your open collar . It's not because your jacket isn't thick enough . __eou__ So wearing a scarf helps your body to stay warm inside your jacket . __eou__ Yes . That's the secret to wearing a thin jacket . __eou__ You know , sometimes I can't feel my ears and fingers . __eou__ I'll lend you my gloves and earmuffs until you get your own . __eou__ Thanks , Pam . You're my lifesaver . __eou__
I don't know what to do about the people who live in the flat above me ! __eou__ Why ? What are they like ? __eou__ They're incredibly selfish . They ' re always up until the wee hours of the night playing their music so loudly that I have to wear earplugs in order to fall asleep ! __eou__ Have you ever talked to them about it ? __eou__ I tried to introduce myself to them when they moved in , but they were so arrogant that I didin't want to ever talk to them again ! __eou__ What did they say ? __eou__ They both just talk about how great they are all the time . __eou__ They soud like the neighbours from hell ! __eou__ They are ! Besides being loud and arrogant , they're also terrible gossips . They're always talking about everybody else in the apartment . __eou__ I thought you didn't talk to them much . __eou__ I don't , but they talk so loudly that I can hear what they're talking about from my bedroom - and it's not very nice . __eou__ What do the other people in your apartment think about them ? __eou__ Most of my other neighbours are scared of them . __eou__ Maybe you should think about moving . __eou__ I can't afford to move right now . __eou__ Well , perhaps you should have a party and try to get to know them better . Maybe once you get to know them , they'll turn out to be more sensitive . __eou__ I think you're being a bit optimistic . If you met them , you'd understand . __eou__ Well , I don't know what else you could do then . Do you think bribing them with chocolate would work ? __eou__
do you like animals ? I really like dogs . __eou__ so do i . I don ’ t like cats . __eou__ why ? I think cats are ok . __eou__ I can ’ t bear being near cats . They don ’ t seem to like me either . __eou__ I like wild animals . I don ’ t like spiders and snakes . I think spiders and snakes are disgusting . __eou__ I ’ m fond of snakes . I think they ’ re great . I agree with you about spiders though . I think spiders are horrible . I think it ’ s because they have so many legs . __eou__ I think bears are wonderful . Pandas are fantastic . I low the people who kill them for their fur . __eou__ I agree . I ’ m carry about mice . I think they ’ re so cute ! __eou__ really ? I don ’ t see the attraction . I ’ m afraid of mice . __eou__

I want to get an idea for the purchasing ability in various countries . __eou__ But you're also going to have to give some attention to trade restrictions . You can get much information about environment of investment . __eou__
Okay , here are the graphs and figures for this month's sales . Let's review them all together . __eou__ This first one , I have a question ... This graph is marking the sales performance for our line of hair products , right ? Can this line be right ? It looks like our sales plummeted . I can't believe we did that poorly ... If I remember correctly , sales went down slightly , but not as dramatically as the graph shows . __eou__ I think you are looking at the wrong line . The rapid drop in sales wasn't our hair products . You are correct , the hair product sales decreased slightly , but not dramatically . The one that didn't do so hot this month was the cleaning products . I think there was a problem in the marketing plan . Some people were offended by our advertisements for the cleaning products , but it was already too late to mitigate the damage , so our mistake shows up in the sales . __eou__ Well , the good news is the new industrial cleaning products really took off . Look how the sales have shot up over the last two weeks . __eou__ That is our one major success . If you look at the other graphs , you can see that most of the other product lines remained steady with little increase . __eou__ At lease they stayed the same . That's better than dropping . __eou__
Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set ? __eou__ We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? That will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock . __eou__ You can double check with the housekeeping department , but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order . __eou__ OK , I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it ? __eou__ I think the only thing is toner . Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . Anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time . __eou__ OK , will do . __eou__
Amelia , could you spare a few minutes ? __eou__ sure . What do you need ? __eou__ well , I wanted to let you know that I've put in my notice . __eou__ really ? Why ? __eou__ it's complicated . But basically it boils down to one thing . This company is downsizing and I can't continue working for a company that may let me go . __eou__ but surely they won't fire you ! You're one of the most experienced managers here ! __eou__ well , to be honest , there's another reason . I've got a better offer . __eou__ well that's great news ! Congratulations ! Where will you be located ? __eou__ the head office is in New York , but I'll be dealing with overseas companies and flying to this side of the world from time to time . __eou__ it'll be sad to see you go , but it sounds like you're found yourself a great opportunity . __eou__ I have . I feel lucky . I look forward to dealing with overseas companies and at the same time having a chance to use English more . __eou__ I'm sorry to bring this up , but would it be possible for you to write me a letter of recommendation before you go ? __eou__ of course I can .

A report says running red lights causes one thousand traffic accidents every year . __eou__ It ’ s horrible . Why do drivers run a red light then ? __eou__ Maybe they know they shouldn ’ t run a red light , but when they are driving they don ’ t pay enough attention to traffic lights . __eou__ Talking on the cell phone while driving is very dangerous too .

What would you say if I told you I was going to quit school ? __eou__ I ’ d say , think twice about it . Well , you are not going to quit school , are you ? __eou__ I don't know . I failed my exam . __eou__ What did you get ? __eou__ A B plus . __eou__ That's not bad . __eou__ But I should have aced it . I mean I finished the paper so quickly , thinking it's a piece of cake . But when I knew my result , I was like what ? That can't be true ! __eou__ Listen , John . I understand that you are such an excellent student and I know you must have lots of stress , but you really want to give up ? __eou__ No , I don't . I just don't know how to handle this . This is my first time , you know . __eou__ I know . Don't worry . Do you know what you should do ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ You need to blow off some steam . The world is not on your shoulder . __eou__ How ? __eou__ Forget about school and exams . Come over to my house and have fun . I have some really good DVDs . __eou__ Thanks . But I really don't feel like watching movies tonight . I have to get an early start in the morning . __eou__ Then go to bed and have a good sleep . __eou__ I guess that's what I need . Thanks . You're being a really good friend . __eou__ Of course I am . Well , pleasant dreams ! __eou__ Thanks , bye . __eou__
Anna , that outfit looks wonderful on you ! The color goes with your trousers perfectly . __eou__ Thanks , Carla . That's quite a compliment coming from you . You always dress so tastefully . __eou__ Well , that dress certainly shows your good taste . It must have cost a lot . __eou__ No , not much . I got it on sale at the mall - 60 % off . __eou__ Really ? You're an amazing bargain hunter ! Next time there's a sale , promise you'll let me tag along with you . __eou__ It's a promise . __eou__
It's really late but I'm starving . __eou__ Hey , that coffee shop's lights are still on . __eou__ Maybe they have some good pie . __eou__ I would love a really sticky cinnamon bun . __eou__ There was a coffee shop by my house when I was a kid that served cinnamon hot chocolate . __eou__ Mmmm . That sounds like something I had in Mexico once . __eou__ Good stuff ... Oh , no . The door is locked . __eou__ Ohhhhh ! And I just got all my juices going ! __eou__
Hurry up , Daniel , it's Barbie time . __eou__ All right , Sis ! __eou__ Come on , it's cool outside . __eou__ I really wish Mom and Dad were here with us . __eou__ Hey , Daniel , what's your favorite weather ? Snowy or sunny ? __eou__ Me ? Er , I like hot weather , just like today . __eou__ What ?

The weekend's finally here ! __eou__ And it's a long one . I have Monday off . It's Memorial Day or something like that . __eou__ Yep . It's the kickoff of the barbecue season . We're invited to a grill party in the park tomorrow . __eou__ Sounds good . What do we need to bring ? __eou__ We need to buy some buns for the hot dogs and hamburgers , and I'm making potato salad . __eou__ I'll dig out the Frisbee and my kite from Taiwan . __eou__
Oh , no . It looks like my computer really has caught a virus . __eou__ Why ? Did you open an attachment ? __eou__ Yes , something called “ George W . Bush . ” An hour later , all I see are pictures of George W . Bush in women's clothes . __eou__ I kind of like it . He looks better that way , doesn't he ? More presidential . __eou__ I preferred the forward with pictures of him side-by-side with monkeys . __eou__ Yeah , their expressions were exactly the same ! __eou__
Good morning , Mr.Black . I am the new secretary . __eou__ Good morning , Miss White . You are half an hour early . __eou__ I don't want to make a bad impression . __eou__ Come on over . This is your desk , and this is your time card . Be sure to clock in and out before and after you work . __eou__ I will . __eou__ One more thing , keep your desk neat . It's the rule . There is no exception , even the art designers have to keep their desks neat . __eou__ I'll keep that in mind . Does everything on the desk belong to me ? __eou__ Not belong . You can use them as long as you work here . When you quit , you ’ ll have to return them to the company . __eou__ What's the extension number for my phone ? __eou__ The operator will put all your calls through . You don't have to worry about that . __eou__ Can I make personal phone calls during my office hours ? __eou__ Of course you can . Every one has his personal matters to deal with more or less , but don't chat over the phone . What's more , don't let it hinder your work and the company's business . __eou__ I understand . __eou__ When you settle down , I'll show you around and introduce you to the department managers . __eou__
Front Desk , may I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I'd like to move to another room . __eou__ Is there anything uncomfortable in your room ? __eou__ Yes . The air-conditioner in this room doesn't work . __eou__ May I have your room number , sir ? __eou__ Wang Wei . Room 1212 . __eou__ OK . Mr .

Thank you . I'm very glad to be here . As Ms . Tina said , the purpose of my presentation today is to familiarize you with the new EBB . As you probably know , EBB stands for Electronic Book Player . Our company put the original EBB on the market a year ago , but we have since all developed an improved model which we believe will be a big seller in both China and the U . S . __eou__ Ms . Yang , can you tell us in what ways the new EBB is better than the old model ? __eou__ Certainly . First of all , the old model had a rather small screen , so not much information could appear at one time . So on the new model , we have made the screen much bigger and ... __eou__ Excuse me , but what are the Mbps mainly used for ? __eou__ Oh , there are many uses and I'll explain them in detail a little later . First , I'd like to ... __eou__ Before you go on , Ms Yang , could you tell us if the original EBB sold well in the U . S . ? __eou__ You were right , Mr . Tim . Your colleagues do want know all about it . __eou__
How do you want to advertise the opening ? __eou__ I've had good responses from the Beijing Times , help-wanted ads . __eou__ All right . I suggest posting the ad Monday through Friday . __eou__ OK . Monday is the big day for job ads . __eou__ And job seekers will certainly check the paper over on Tuesday . __eou__ Let's post on the Internet , too . Will get a better response . I'll post the ads . I know some good sites . __eou__ Such concern for the company , Craig ! I'm impressed . __eou__
I've just got Bean's new brand image . Let's make a T-shirt line with these pics . __eou__ Are you nuts ? It's the President of the United States in lingerie ! __eou__ Exactly ! With the war in Iraq , they'll sell like crazy around the world . __eou__ What's next ? Tony Blair in high heels ? __eou__ Sure . I'd rather show Bean in a garter belt , but all in good time . __eou__ Inspiration can come in the strangest ways ... __eou__
Would you like me to go into a little more detail about the free services we can offer you ? __eou__ Yes please . I really am an absolute amateur when it comes to this stuff . __eou__ No problem . First of all , we can provide a business licence . Secondly , Enterprise ID Certificates , Forex registration and ... __eou__ Forex registration ? __eou__ Yes , ' Foreign Exchange Registration ' , for Bank Drafts , Bills of Exchange and so on . Also , approval of RIB accounts , capital verification and so on . __eou__
Good afternoon , welcome to IBA . How can I be of service ? __eou__ I'd like to talk to somebody about the Group Account Deposit Service . __eou__ This refers to the deposit business offered to the level 1 account of group companies . __eou__ What is it used for ? I mean , why bother to get this special account ? __eou__ Group companies can use this to make their arrangement of funds flexible , when dealing with their subsidiaries . __eou__ I see , so this can really cut down on time and centralise management . Interesting ... __eou__
It's hot today , shall we go for a dip at the beach ? __eou__ That's a good idea . Let's bring our trunks and towels . __eou__ Would you like to swim in the swimming pool or at the beach ? __eou__ I'd prefer the pool . __eou__ OK . Let's pay the entrance fee and change our clothes in the dressing room . __eou__ What style do you use ? __eou__ Well , I use breast stroke for long distance , crawl or free style for short distance and back stroke just for fun . __eou__
Should I go now ? __eou__ Nice and easy . Just give it a little gas . __eou__ Nothing is happening ! __eou__ First you have to put the car into gear . Move this shifter so the arrow points at D for drive . __eou__ What do these other letters mean ? __eou__ R is for reverse , P is for park , and D1 and D2 are lower gears for going through snow , or up a steep hill . __eou__
Hey Annie , who is this picture of ? __eou__ Oh , that's my great , great , great , great , great , great , great grandfather . __eou__ I think you can say your seventh great grandfather ! Cutie ! What's his name ? __eou__ Peter Madsen . A great A if I do say so myself . __eou__ Nice pun . What is it you active about him most ? __eou__ He loved his family and his countrymen and his freedom . __eou__ He looks like a very personable man . __eou__ He was . He was friendly toward and showed concern for everyone he met . __eou__
I had a terrible journey back from Bangkok last week . __eou__ Really ? Why ? What happened ? __eou__ Well , first of all , the taxi that was taking me from the client's office to the airport broke down on the freeway . __eou__ Oh , no . __eou__ Yes , and the driver didn't speak any English or Chinese and he didn't have a phone on him-can you believe it ? - and his radio didn't work . So there was no way he could get in touch with the office to get them to send another taxi . __eou__ So what did you do ? __eou__ Well , I actually thumbed a lift . __eou__ You what ? __eou__ Yes , I stood on the side of the freeway and stuck my thumb out , and a passing truck stopped and took me to the airport . __eou__ Wow , good for you . __eou__ Yes , except he drove really slowly , and I missed my flight . __eou__ Oh , no ! __eou__ Yes , so I had to wait three hours for the next one . I didn't get home till four in the morning , and when I got home I realized I'd left my house keys in my hotel in Bangkok . __eou__ You really have bad luck , don't you ? __eou__ Seems like it . __eou__
Yeah . You don't need to rub it in . __eou__ And then she made the deal with MicroPower . Vince wanted to sell for fifteen million ... __eou__ Fifteen ? And Zina pushed them up to seventy-five ? __eou__ That's right . Vince still stops by her office every day to thank her . __eou__ Anyway , I'm still happy I left . I'm working as a freelancer now . __eou__ You really should have stayed with us , Dave . __eou__
Is that you , Dave ? Oh , my gosh ! The backstabber who left us to work for the evil WebTracker ! __eou__ Yeah , yeah , yeah . Hi , Mary . How are you ? __eou__ I'm filthy rich ! Haven't you heard about the MicroPower deal ? __eou__ Yeah , I guess I did . They're going to buy invoking ? __eou__ That's right . For seventy-five million . So how are you ? __eou__ I'm getting by OK . I heard MicroPower was going to make Zina president of their new invoking Internet division . __eou__
Are you going to leave school at the end of the term ? __eou__ Yes , I am . __eou__ What are you going to do ? __eou__ I'm going to be a clerk . __eou__ What does a clerk do ? __eou__ He works in an office . He writes letters and reports , and he types . __eou__ I want to be a vet . __eou__ A-what ? __eou__ A vet-a veterinary surgeon . __eou__ Good gracious ! What's that ? __eou__ A vet's a man who takes care of sick animals . He's an animal doctor . __eou__ I once read a story about a person who talked to animals . It was very interesting . __eou__
Good morning , doctor . I've been suffering very much from a toothache lately . __eou__ Well , let me have a look . Will you sit down in this chair and open your mouth wide ? __eou__ I think one of the back ones at the top is giving me the most trouble . __eou__ Yes . This big one is badly decayed . I'm afraid it must be taken out . __eou__ Oh , I hate having teeth pulled out . Will it hurt ? __eou__ No need to worry . You won't feel anything at all . I'll give you an injection to stop the pain . Just wash your mouth out with this water , will you ? __eou__ Will it take long ? __eou__ No , it'll be over soon . Nurse , get some X-rays of our patient's molars . Then we'll start . Open your mouth wide . Don't be so nervous . Now open wider ... now stay , that's over ... __eou__ Is it out ? __eou__ Not yet , but it soon will be . Now open again please ... It's out ! Look ! __eou__ Well , really ! That was wonderful ! I felt no pain at all . Thank you , doctor . __eou__
Hi , Zina . Lots of people are looking for you . __eou__ Like who ? __eou__ Like Elvin . He isn't too happy about what you promised Stars.com . __eou__ I've got it under control . __eou__ You do realize that it isn't humanly possible for us to finish by next week ? __eou__ What if you had three more top-notch programmers to help you ? __eou__ That would definitely make a difference . But Vince already said no . __eou__
And so , I just wanted to check in with you and find out where we are with this project . As you know , you ’ Ve missed a fairly significant deadline last week , and this will negativity impact the team ’ s ability to move forward with the next stages of this project . __eou__ I know , I ’ m really sorry that I missed the deadline . But really , it wasn ’ t my fault . You see , we had all of these unexpected technical problems at the last minute , and that I couldn ’ t get into the database and extract the kind of information that I needed for the data analysis . You know , if the tech guys would have done their job and kept the ARM stable , then I wouldn ’ t have missed my deadline . __eou__ Oh , come on ! An excuse like that is tantamount to lying . You ’ re essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues , rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks . __eou__ No , I ’ m not trying to pass the buck here ; I know that it was me who is ultimately responsible for getting this done . But the thing is , I could have finished on time if the system hadn ’ t gone down . And you know , with everything I ’ Ve got going on now , I can ’ t afford to waste time dealing with technical problems . I ’ Ve got a lot on my plate and there are only twenty-four hours in a day ... __eou__ I ’ m not going to accept this excuse . You ’ re using these small technical glitches as a crutch and trying to rationalize the fact that you ’ Ve missed your deadline . Look , we have standards and I expect you to live up to those standards . No more phoney cases . If you ’ re in over your head , you tell me . No more missed deadlines . Now , I want that data on my desk by nine am ! __eou__
It's Mrs Bardot , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it is . But I'm afraid we haven't met before . __eou__ I'm Greg Wu , Head of Consultancy . I see that you'd like a credit check done for your company . Is that right ? __eou__ Hello Greg . Yes , that's correct . You see , we have just acquired a new partner , the transaction is huge . It's to be signed next month , and we would really like to have some clearer information about them . __eou__ I see . So , it's not for your company , it's for the prospective partner ? __eou__ That's right . I feel it's always better to go in with both eyes open , if you know what I mean . __eou__ I couldn't agree more . If you have the company details with you I can get on with that right away . Is there anything else that you need from us today ? __eou__ The lady at the desk , Shelly I think , told me you offer many other consultancy services . __eou__ We do indeed . Such as making trade investments , financial consultancy , and of course the service you requested . __eou__ That's good to know . Thanks for your help today , I'll leave you with the details and you can get started . __eou__
My dear , what's for supper ? __eou__ Red cooked carp and rape with fresh mushrooms . __eou__ What about soup ? __eou__ Sour-peppery soup . __eou__ Which condiment do you use for ? __eou__ I'll use ginger , garlic scallion , hot pepper and vinegar . __eou__ Very good , need I help you ? __eou__ No , don't need , I can do myself . __eou__ Thanks . I can watch TV now . __eou__ But you must cook that dinner next time . __eou__ Okay , I'll do it next time . __eou__
Excuse me , I'm looking for a good novel . Can you recommend anything ? __eou__ Certainly . What kind of novel did you have in mind ? __eou__ I'm not really sure . I don't like romance novels , but any other genre is okay , as long as the book's good . __eou__ Well , let me see ... This Stephen King novel is a real thriller . __eou__ Sorry , I forgot to mention that I don't like horror much , either . __eou__ That's okay . Well , let me think . How about a mystery novel ? __eou__ Hmm ... I sometimes like mysteries , but I don't think I'm in the mood for one right now . __eou__ There are a number of science fiction and fantasy novels I can recommend . __eou__ I love science fiction and fantasy , but I've been reading a lot of both lately , so I'd prefer to get something else . __eou__ How about a good historical novel ? This one set in medieval France is excellent . The story is exciting and the characterization is very well done . __eou__ That sounds interesting . Okay , I'll get this one . Thanks for all your help . __eou__ Don't mention it . __eou__
I'm done . Can I watch TV ? __eou__ Here's some water . Take these multi-vitamins and Tylenol . __eou__ Uh ! I can't swallow them , Mom ! __eou__ Your throat must be swollen . __eou__ Do I have to take them ? __eou__ Here , I'll break them up , so they're smaller . And here's some cough syrup . __eou__ Yuck ! __eou__ I know , it tastes horrible . But it'll make you feel better . Try holding your nose . It won't taste as bad . __eou__
They're here ! Now that's speedy service ! And they arrived within two days of each other ! __eou__ What are you waiting for ? Rip ‘ em open ! __eou__ Wow ... this shirt is nice , but looks big . __eou__ It's nice , but how much did you end up paying ? __eou__ With the shipping included--seventy dollars . __eou__ Hmm ... not so hot . They sell them here for about that . __eou__
Have we handed out all the water ? __eou__ Yes . So what else to do now ? __eou__ Nothing . The teacher said the only thing left was to get back all the disposable cups later . __eou__ I see . How do you like the game ? __eou__ Terrific . There is one girl said , It is the best game I've ever watched . __eou__ Who do you think do better ? __eou__ Clive was really outstanding . Not only he put on a big show himself , but also he inspired the whole team . __eou__ Exactly . He is unbelievable . __eou__ On the other hand , I think the other team won everyone's respect . The leader said they could have crumpled at the beginning , but they just carried on and never lost their cool . __eou__ They were really tough . __eou__ The thing I like most about them is that they did not play with a heavy heart even though at that time the odds seemed to be against them . __eou__ I can't agree more . Okay , time is up . Let's do the last thing . __eou__
I ’ Ve always wondered , what ’ s the difference between English for Chinese students and English for native students ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . What do you think ? __eou__ I think a Chinese student concentrates on written English , and uses it as a basis for communicating . From start to finish he ’ s learning vocabulary and fundamentals of grammar . This is a very difficult way to learn . __eou__ What do natives get ? __eou__ They get higher level English , which is more formal than everyday spoken English . They also deal with matters of style and creativity . __eou__ Do you mean that a native doesn ’ t make any mistakes in grammar ? __eou__ Absolutely not ! Native speakers make a lot of grammar mistakes , especially if they come from a home where nonstandard English is spoken . __eou__ I suppose that only a small percentage of college students don ’ t know standard English in American universities . __eou__ Actually there are more non-native speakers than you think . That ’ s why it ’ s so important to quit worrying about making mistakes . Just talk to everyone every chance you get . __eou__
You'll soon graduate from your university . Do you have any plans for the future ? __eou__ I'm planning to go to graduate school , but I also want to find a job . Otherwise , I'll have nowhere to go if I fail the entrance exam . __eou__ Do you have a clear career path to follow ? __eou__ career path ? I'm not sure . __eou__ what kind of job do you want after graduation ? __eou__ I want to become a professor , a lawyer , an editor , a civil servant ... __eou__ wait ! You can't do so many things at the same time . What exactly do you want ? __eou__ I don't know . Do you have any advice for me ? __eou__ yeah , you should first decide what kind of career you really want , plan your career path , and then try your best to achieve your goal . __eou__ I think perhaps I need to buy a few years while I figure out about my career . __eou__ no , you can't waste your time wandering around . If you want a job that requires a higher degree or diploma , you should focus on your graduate school entrance exam ; if you want a job that needs working __eou__ thank you so much for your advice . I'll think it over . __eou__
Hi , Nicole . Did you have a good weekend ? __eou__ Yes , I did . But I feel tired today . __eou__ Really ? Why ? __eou__ Well , on Saturday I cleaned the house and played tennis . Then on Sunday I hiked in the country . __eou__ And I bet you studied , too . __eou__ Yeah . I studied on Sunday evening . What about you ? __eou__ Well , I didn't clean the house and I didn't study . I stayed in bed and watched TV . __eou__ That sounds like fun , but did you exercise ? __eou__ Sort of . I played golf on my computer ! __eou__
Every country should face the history . __eou__ Yeah , we don ’ t live in the vacuum . We have traditional values and long but different history . __eou__ Sometimes , we , human beings , really had done something wrong , so we should admit it at first . __eou__ But there is always somebody who wants to turn his back on the true history . __eou__ I believe such things won ’ t be realized , just daydreaming . __eou__
Let ' s got out tomorrow night . We can go to a bar and try to find you a girlfriend . __eou__ I don ' t think that ' s a good idea . I am just not good with approaching someone and starting up a conversation . __eou__ Maybe you just need a few pick-up lines , you know , break the ice . __eou__ Pick-up lines don ' t work ! __eou__ Come on ! You can just walk up to a girl and say “ If you were a booger I \ ' d pick you first . ” __eou__ What ? Come on ! That ’ s just lame ! No girl would fall for that ! __eou__ Fine , then you can say , “ So there you are ! I ' Ve been looking all over for YOU , the woman of my dreams ! ” __eou__ That ' s a good one ! I think that ' s pretty funny . __eou__ Yeah , so you make her laugh , you make a fool of yourself a little bit and then you buy her a drink . __eou__ Ok , how does this sound , “ I was so enchanted by your beauty that I ran into that wall over there . So I am going to need your name and number for insurance purposes . ” __eou__ Nice ! Let ' s go ! __eou__
Are you ready , honey ? __eou__ Sorry , not yet ! can you help me to select the dress ? i don , t what i should wear to fit thinner party . __eou__ Just dress formal . __eou__ How about transom ? __eou__ It is too loud , we ’ ll handle some official business first before the dinner . __eou__ Oh , i nearly forget it . __eou__ You can put on your white shoes , it fits every occasion . __eou__
Excuse me , Sir , May I have the time , please ? __eou__ Beg your pardon ? __eou__ Er ... I'd like to know what time it is now . __eou__ Oh , Let me see ... It's three forty-five . Er ... wait , My watch is five minutes fast . So it should be three forty __eou__ Thank you . By the way , what day is today ? __eou__ Today is Friday . Are you new in Beijing ? __eou__ Yes , I've just come from the States , yesterday in fact . I'm still a bit confused about the time . __eou__ Welcome to Beijing . This is my business card . I'm an engineer . If you need any help in Beijing , just give me a call . __eou__ Oh , that's very nice of you . I don't want to sound pushy , but I still l have one more question . __eou__ Go ahead . __eou__ What's the date today ? __eou__ It's October the 1st , our National Day . I'd like to talk some more , but I've got to get going now . It was nice talking to you , though . __eou__ Yeah , it was nice to meet you . Hope I run into you again sometime . __eou__
May I see your passport please ? __eou__ Yes . Here it is . __eou__ Are you travelling for business or pleasure ? __eou__ I'm going to visit some relatives here for several months . __eou__ Do you have anything to declare ? Jewellery or cash ? __eou__ The only things I brought were some cloths and my notebook computer . __eou__ Did you bring any fruits , vegetables , fresh meats or plants into this country ? __eou__ No , Sir , I did not . __eou__
This room is unacceptable . I want a new one , and I want a refund for tonight . __eou__ Would you please tell me the exact problem , sir ? __eou__ I'm being attacked by hordes of cockroaches ! __eou__ Oh , my gosh , they're back ? Another room at once , sir , plus a full refund , of course . __eou__ Thank you very much . This has been a most unsettling experience . __eou__ Sir , our guests are our reason for being . __eou__
Who's in charge of the construction project ? __eou__ We've taken on a civil engineer on a nine-month temporary contract . He'll oversee the whole project . In fact we're having a project meeting at 3 p . m this afternoon allocate responsibilities and finalise the time schedule . Why don't you join us ? __eou__ I can ’ t I'm afraid . I've got another meeting scheduled for 2:30 p . m . __eou__
Good morning , Helen . __eou__ Good morning , Steven . __eou__ So , what's the status of our advertising campaign ? __eou__ It'll be a national campaign starting next week . __eou__ What style will the ads be ? __eou__ I suggest that we focus on slice of life , showing how you can beat the summer heat by biting into a cool ice-cream sandwich . __eou__ Sounds like a good idea . Will we have a new slogan ? __eou__ Definitely . __eou__

I think that is because you have right qualifications and nice personality . __eou__ Thanks again . I will start on next Monday . I am sure I will have good performance . __eou__ I agree . __eou__

Could you let me have your card and the money to be deposited ? __eou__ Here it is . I usually use the machine , but there seems to be such a long queue at the moment . __eou__ Yes , it's the same every day during the lunchtime rush .

My friend once used it mostly to play chess , but now he has learnt how to do other things on the Internet . __eou__ There's no doubt the Internet will be a powerful commercial medium . It'll connect hundreds of millions of customers and open up huge markets for all kinds of products and services . __eou__ That's true . I can imagine companies sending advertisements directly to customers over the net . Customers , in turn , can examine and compare whatever goods they want to buy and tell their computers to find them at the best price offered . __eou__ Yeah . It'll be a shoppers heaven . That's the use of net in E-commerce . __eou__
Espresso is made with a machine that forces steam and boiling water through finely ground coffee . It's strong . __eou__ OK , OK , this is good . Keep talking .

We offer this to anyone who will study outside this country . __eou__ I see . What does it entail ? I'm not sure if we will be eligible . __eou__ This loan is specially provided for people who are studying overseas to pay for their tuition fee and other sundry items . __eou__ So , we could use it to pay for my son's living expenses , not just his tuition ? __eou__ That's right . The sundries could include accommodation , text books and so on . The guidelines are not so strict , you see . __eou__ That is good to know . Just think !

That's too late . __eou__ But why is it too late ? It's Saturday night.You have nothing to do tomorrow . Why not stay out and drink with us ? __eou__ Were you so wild when you were still in Taipei , Sharon ? __eou__ Yes , I was . And I like living here.People know how to party here . In Taipei , some people know how to party.But here , everyone does . __eou__ What is that they're doing on the couch ? __eou__ They're smoking pot . Don't worry about it . __eou__ Pot ? Isn't that marijuana ? __eou__ Yes , it is . __eou__ But , Sharon , that's illegal ! The police could come , and we could go to jail . __eou__ Don't worry about it . It is true that pot is illegal in America.But the laws aren't as strict as in Taiwan.If people are arrested , and they have a little pot in their possession , they don't go to jail . They just have to pay a fine . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I didn't know you had such wild friends . Do you smoke marijuana too ? __eou__ I tried it a couple times . But I don't like it . I like alcohol better.Don ' t worry about them , though . If you don't want to smoke pot , you don't have to . __eou__ I don't want to . __eou__ That's alright . But you really should have another drink.People will probably start dancing soon . __eou__ I don't know if I can drink more . I already had two drinks . __eou__ You had two drinks at nine o'clock . C'mon , Ann , you are in an American university now ! You have to learn how to drink . __eou__ I thought a university was for studying . __eou__ It is . We study hard all week.And then , on the weekend , we party hard . That's the best way to live . __eou__ Alright . I'll have another drink . __eou__
Mr . Black ? I'm from the Pacific Mechanical Company . __eou__ Oh , yes . Step inside , will you ? I'll give you an idea of what business I want to take up with you . Take a seat . We can go into details later . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Our speciality back in South Africa is wholesale supplying of screws , bolts , nuts , pins , studs , and that kind of things . __eou__ For wood or for metal ? __eou__ For both . Now , do you make machines for producing such things ? __eou__ Yes , we have a showroom not far away from here , Mr . Black . Are you free now ? __eou__ Yes , quite free until noon . __eou__ Fine . Then , shall we go right away ? I have a car outside . __eou__ Have you ? That's splendid . Just let me get my things together . I won't keep you long . __eou__ Take your time , sir . I can wait . __eou__
I am really exhausted , you know , I have been working without the weekend for two weeks . My boss always asks us to work overtime . __eou__ Does your boss pay you for the over-time work ? __eou__ No . But he provides free meals and sometimes gives us some small gifts . Many of us get very tired of this , and we'd rather have weekends than stay in the office . __eou__ He should know that this is against the Labor Law in our country . Legally , employees should get double pay if asked to do extra work during the weekend or on holidays . __eou__ We all know about that , but we have no choice . The chairman of the trade union says he is going to negotiate with the management . __eou__ I suggest that you go to the lawyers ' office to get some help . __eou__ That's a good idea . I think we will soon come to a solution to the problem . __eou__
Hey Lisa ... want to grab lunch with me ? __eou__ Sure , Emily . We haven't done that in a while . __eou__ Yeah ... actually , we haven't hung out at all recently . You seem sort of under the weather . Is there something going on ? __eou__ Well , keep this under your hat , but I think I'm going to quit after New Year . __eou__ Quit this company ? Oh ... wow . __eou__ I know I should be pretty happy here , but I'm not finding the kind of job satisfaction I need . I'm a good graphic designer ... __eou__ One of the best in the company . __eou__ That's kind of you to say . But ... the stuff we do here hasn't really challenged me very much at all . __eou__ Oh , I get it . Simply put , you're bored , huh ? __eou__ That's one way of putting it . For me , a job needs to stimulate my brain , otherwise it becomes a daily drudgery . __eou__
Hello , come in , I've been waiting for you . __eou__ Than you , I'm not late , am I ? __eou__ No , no , no , not at all.It ' s just that I've been looking forward to meeting you . __eou__ Well , thank you , but it's not all that hard to do , you know . I've been calling your office and sending you proposals for about two years now , and you've never responded before . __eou__ Ha , ha , ha ! Yes , I guess I deserved that . Let me explain , okay ? __eou__ Please , I wish you would . __eou__ Well , as you probably know I buy from a selected group of suppliers and don't , as a rule , deal with new people . __eou__ Yes , I know that . It's why Ive been trying to become one of those suppliers . I hear you're a good man to do business with . __eou__ I'm very old-fashioned . I believe in loyalty.Once I start a sales relationship with someone , I stay with him or her , and we so most of our business on the phone . I expect their absolute best price possible and don't haggle.But if I find out they screwed me over , then I find another supplier . __eou__ That's pretty much what I heard . __eou__ Well , those are my terms . As long as you honor them , we do business.If you break faith and try to take advantage , I'll find someone else to work with . Can you live with that ? __eou__ No problem at all , Mike . Just give me the chance . __eou__
As you know I ’ Ve been thinking about moving my career in a new direction . I am hoping that you will be able to provide me with a reference to help me jump-start my future . __eou__ I realize that I ’ m not in a position to offer you the kind of promotion you deserve I'll gladly do what I can to help . __eou__ Thank you . I ’ Ve really enjoyed my time here . I've grown both personally and professionally with this company . __eou__ And , as well as being a pleasure to work with , you ’ Ve been instrumental in helping us complete many key projects . __eou__ It will be hard to say good-bye . This office has become like a second home to me . __eou__ My feelings are mixed on the issue too . By helping you I ’ m losing a valuable and trusted employee . However I think you are taking a step in the right direction . __eou__
Mom , is there anything in the fridge I can eat before dinner ? __eou__ There's some leftover pizza from last night . __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ Um , I think there may be some leftover lasagna from the other day . __eou__ Do I have any other choices ? __eou__ There might be some birthday cake left in the freezer . __eou__ Is everything in the fridge leftovers ? I hate leftovers ! __eou__ You can wash the vegetables and cut the chicken and I'll make dinner ! __eou__
Who was the best teacher that you ever had ? __eou__ That would have to be Miss Baymler , my fourth grade teacher . __eou__ What was she like ? __eou__ She was patient , kind , fun , smart , caring , and yet strict , too . I really learned a lot from her . __eou__ What kind of things did you learn ? __eou__ She taught us that you can do anything that you want to do . __eou__ Anything ? Do you really believe that we can do anything ? __eou__ If you really want to do something and you work hard at it , I believe you can do it . __eou__ You said she was strict . Did she have a lot of rules ? __eou__ She had some rules that helped us to feel comfortable . For example , the students had to treat each other with respect , or they would be disciplined . __eou__ I see . She sounds like she really cared about her students . __eou__ Yes . She treated us all fairly . She don ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets . __eou__ Really ? Doesn ’ t every teacher have a teacher ’ s pet ? __eou__ Well . To be honest , I usually sucked up to teachers because I wanted them to give me good grades . However , Miss Baymler didn ’ t treat me any differently . She really didn ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets . __eou__ Do you know what she is doing now ? __eou__ As a matter of fact , I do . After she taught our class , she got married and moved to another city . Then , she started writing children ’ s book . __eou__ Have you ever read one of the books ? __eou__ Of course ! Both children and adults enjoy her books . __eou__ Why don ’ t you recommend one to me ? __eou__ ok ! I ’ ll bring one to you next time . __eou__

Please press that button if you need any help . __eou__ OK . __eou__
Excuse me , I need to get to Cambridge today . __eou__ Would you like to go by train or by bus ? __eou__ I am not sure , which one is better ? __eou__ The bus is cheaper but also slower . It will take about two-and-a-half hours . __eou__ And how long does the train take ? __eou__ If you take the fast train , it will take about 50 minutes . __eou__ Where do I catch the train ? __eou__ The trains for Cambridge leave from King's Cross Station . They run approximately every half hour . Most trains to Cambridge go from Platform 9 . __eou__ How do I get to King's Cross ? __eou__ The best way is to take an underground tube train directly to King's Cross . The Underground station is just round the corner from here . __eou__ Can you show me on the map ? __eou__ It is very easy . Just turn right when you leave and then turn right again at the first crossroads . The entrance to the Underground station is about 50 meters further on . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ You're welcome . __eou__

Hello , may I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I need some more cash for my visit in China . May I cash a traveler ’ s check here ? __eou__ Of course . We would be happy to cash it for you . __eou__ I was going to cash it at the hotel , but one of my friends said that banks always give better exchange rates . __eou__ Well , any bank will cash it at our present traveler's check buying rate , for which we ’ re somewhere cheaper than hotels because of the service charge . You see , hotels really aren ’ t in the money exchange business although they will cash traveler ’ s check for their guest . __eou__ You mean there is really not that much of a difference . __eou__ No , madam . Not very much . __eou__ Well , may I cash these three checks for 100 dollars each ? I think that will be enough . __eou__ Yes , I'll be happy to cash these for you . Would you please countersign them here ? __eou__ Ok . __eou__

You know what I mean ? __eou__ Yeah , I guess you're right . It's easy to get bogged down in the day to day , and forget to change things up once in a while . Let's break out and do something completely different tonight . __eou__ Okay , I'll look in the events section of the paper to see what's going on tonight . Hmm , we could go to a concert . There is a good one tonight . I bet it's not sold out . But , we'll have to drive an hour to the venue . __eou__ An hour ? That's a bit of a bummer . Let me take a peek and see what else there is . How about going dancing ? We haven't done that in a while . There's a club in Silver Lake that's supposed to be hopping on Friday nights . Eddie from work told me that they have a really good DJ and a big dance floor , and the cover charge isn't bad . __eou__ I'm not really in the mood for dancing , actually . You know what ? I just feel like staying home tonight and vegging , after all . How about you ? __eou__ Yeah , I was hoping you'd say that . It's nice to have the option to go out but I'd rather stay in . Maybe we can go out tomorrow night . __eou__ Yeah , definitely , tomorrow night . __eou__

Everyone's laughing ! __eou__ He said you obviously prefer Greek comedies to Greek tragedies . __eou__
Can you be serious for a moment , we've been dating for 6 months now , I really like you . I'd like to take a relationship to the next level . __eou__ So what are you trying to say to me ? __eou__ It feels like you are not dedicate to our relationship . It seems like you treat it as a just casual dating . __eou__ How should I say it ? __eou__ I don't want to be like this . I think we should get step further . __eou__ It has only been 6 months , our relationship hasn't had a chance to maturate . We are still have some hurdle we have to jump over . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ Last week I saw Brain kissing you on the cheek . __eou__ It was only the cheek . __eou__ That is ok , then ? Starts on the cheek ? pretty soon you french kiss in the back on his car . __eou__ Oh , that is ridiculous . __eou__ So is it ok if I kiss other women on the cheek ? __eou__ Definitely not . __eou__ You see , we still have hurdle . __eou__
What happened to that girl you were seeing ? __eou__ Oh Jackie ? We broke up last week . __eou__ That was a short relationship . You only started dating 2 months ago . __eou__ It was actually a long two months . She was a psycho . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ She would be laughing one moment , and if I said something insensitive , she would start crying . I didn't want to deal with that . __eou__ She sounds very emotional . __eou__ She was a psycho , man . One time we were suppose to get together . I was waiting for her call , and when she finally called , she was screaming why I wasn't at her place . __eou__ Were you suppose to be there ? __eou__ I thought she was going to call when she was done shopping . It was a misunderstanding . She was literally screaming on the phone over this . __eou__ Ok . You're right . She's a psycho . __eou__ I'm just glad it's over . __eou__
Are you going anywhere for your vacation ? __eou__ Yes , we're making plans for a tour . __eou__ That'll be lovely . Where are you going ? __eou__ Well start out from Long Island this Friday . We've planned a four day drive to Salt Lake City , where we'll join my brother and his family on his fortieth birthday . __eou__ Well , you've got to prepare a lot of food and enough sleeping bags then . __eou__ Oh , we'll spend the nights in hotels and enjoy local food as we pass by . How does it sound , David ? __eou__ It sounds good . You can do a lot of sightseeing , too . __eou__ Yes , we'll take our time .

Aren ’ t you going to swim ? __eou__ Are you kidding ? Don't you know I can't swim ? __eou__ You are not telling me that we drove 50 miles to come here for just sunbath , are you ? __eou__ Hey , don't shout . Come here ! Sit closer . Now , Jim , we ’ Ve had a lovely day . Don't spoil it now . __eou__ What about your beautiful bathing suit ? We shopped all day . Don't you want to show it off ? __eou__ Everybody who walks past me sees it . Besides , it's a good sunbathing suit . __eou__ All right . Suit yourself . I am going swimming . __eou__ Jim ! __eou__ Yes ? __eou__ Can you get me a beach umbrella and a deck chair ? I am really tired of lying in thousand . __eou__ I've got a better idea . Why don ’ t we hire a boat and go for a ride ? What do you think ? __eou__ Are you serious ? That will be wonderful ! __eou__
Will you be checking in any baggage today ? __eou__ Yes , I have two large suitcases and one box . __eou__ If you need baggage tags , they are found in the box on your right . __eou__ No , thank you.They are already tagged with my name and address . __eou__ You are allowed an additional two carry-on items . __eou__ Good , I have my backpack and my camera tripod . __eou__ I see . All carry-on items must be able to fit under the seat or in the overhead bin . __eou__ Both my items will fit under the seat or in the overhead bin . __eou__ You will need to send the tripod as luggage because it is too long to fit in our gauge box for carry-on items . __eou__ I cannot let anything happen to that tripod.Can you guarantee it will not be damaged if I check it in ? __eou__ No , I can't . Perhaps your stewardess will help you to find a place to store it . __eou__ Good idea . I will ask the stewardess to help me store my tripod . __eou__
But it's the White House . The president and his family live there.They won't let us see most of it . Probably we can only see a couple of rooms . __eou__ No , that's not true.The White House is very big . And there are a lot of historical exhibits there.The tour will take us through many different rooms . I read about it in the guide . __eou__ Hmm . If that's true , then the security there must be very good.Because it's strange to think they will let people walk around in the White House . __eou__ I'm sure the security is very tight.Probably they will make us walk through metal detectors like at the airport . __eou__ So I can't take my gun then . __eou__ Don't always joke like that ! You don't have a gun . __eou__ Yes , it's true I don't . __eou__ You shouldn't say things like that . You could get arrested ! __eou__ What ? Do you think someone will arrest me for making a joke ? Someone will arrest me here at the breakfast table ? __eou__ No . But if you say something like that in the White House , they may take it seriously . Sometimes I think you joke too much . __eou__ I'll be careful . Don't worry . I don't want to get arrested by the FBI.But how long does the White House tour last ? __eou__ I'm not sure . I think it lasts about one hour . __eou__ Alright . We should take a taxi over there right after breakfast . __eou__ First I want to look in the travel guide.Maybe they don't have tours in the morning . __eou__ That's a good idea . Do you want some more coffee ? __eou__ No , I'm fine . __eou__

Could you give me some advice ? __eou__ Not a problem . Which loan was it you were interested in ? Sorry , I must ask , because the interest rates can depend on the type of loan you apply for . __eou__ I understand . I'm interested in the Petty Consumer Loan . __eou__ One of our most popular ! The usual interest rate is fixed by the PBC . That is The People's Bank of China . But of course , with some loans , credit rating and loan amount come into play , too . __eou__ So , the rate could fluctuate a little , depending on the amount given by the PBC ? __eou__ That is correct . __eou__ I'm going to have to do some more research into this . Thanks for your help , bye for now . __eou__

I found some answering skills are useful . These questions are different from exams . __eou__ We can have a rest now after this tough interview . __eou__ Don't be rush .

I just saw Something About Mary last night . It was hilarious . __eou__ David took me to it last week . I thought it was a little sick . __eou__ What do you mean sick ? It was really funny , don't you think ? __eou__ It was entertaining in some ways . But in general I didn't like it . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ I just think the humor was too gross . There were too many disgusting things in it . I don't think a comedy has to have so much smut to be funny . __eou__ It wasn't a dirty movie . There wasn't even any nudity . __eou__ No , you're right . But nudity doesn't bother me . What bothered me were all the jokes about masturbation , stuff like that . It was too sick . __eou__ Oh , you are too conservative . It's just realistic . __eou__ I don't think it's realistic . I thought it was sick . Why does a movie have to use that kind of humor ? __eou__ People think it's funny . __eou__
Here is the draft contract , Mr . Brown . Let's discuss the clauses to see if we agree on all of them . Then I will make out an original of the contract . After that , what's left is to fill out the contract and sign our names . __eou__ That's OK . __eou__ The contract is to be written in Chinese and English . Both languages are equally effective . __eou__ Fine . If you'll excuse me , I'd like to go it over first . ( After about 15 minutes ) Hmm , you've done a pretty good job . It's well prepared . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Well , I suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time . __eou__ That's a good idea . __eou__ First , let's read Clause Two about packing . It's our usual practice to ship our products in containers . That'll save time and money , but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases . So , we'd like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract . __eou__ Agreed . __eou__ For shipment , you know we are producing a complete set of equipment for you and it won't all be finished at one time . So would you allow us to make partial shipments . __eou__ I understand your position . __eou__
have you finished going through the contract ? __eou__ yes , but I have a few questions for you . __eou__ Ok . Ask away . __eou__ first , I ’ d like to know if you offer employees sick leave . __eou__ yes , employees can take up to 10 days of sick leave per year . However , in order to get paid , you ’ ll have to bring in a note from the doctor ’ s . __eou__ even if I ’ m only sick for one day ? __eou__ that ’ s correct . __eou__ that ’ s pretty strict , if you ask me . __eou__ well , we ’ Ve had to add that to the contract because we found that many of our employees were taking almost one sick day a month , even though they weren ’ t sick . __eou__ I see . I guess that makes sense . __eou__ do you have any other questions ? __eou__ yes . Maternity leave is mentioned in the contract , but there ’ s nothing in the contract alout paternity leave . Do you offer anything to fathers ? __eou__ we do actually . We can add that as an amendment to your contract . __eou__ how many days of paternity leave do you offer ? __eou__ men are allowed to take 10 days of paternity leave for their first child . __eou__ why are women allowed so much more time for maternity leave ? __eou__ well , women are the ones giving birth . I think it ’ s fair to give them more time , don ’ t you ? __eou__ I guess so . I don ’ t have any other questions . Should I sign here then ? __eou__ yes , please . __eou__
Hello ? __eou__ Hi , is Heather there please ? __eou__ Sorry , I think you have the wrong number . __eou__ Is this 617-228-2289 ? __eou__ Yes . Who are you looking for again ? __eou__ Heather Johnson . __eou__ Oh , I thought you said Laura . Sorry about that . This is the right number , but Heather's not here right now . __eou__ Do you know where she went ? __eou__ She went to the store to buy some groceries . Would you like to leave a message ? __eou__ Yes , would you please tell her Eric Martin called ? __eou__ Hi Eric , this is her roommate Kathy . I met you a couple months ago at the Christmas party . __eou__ Oh , yes . How are you ? __eou__ Good . Heather will be back in about 20 minutes . I'll tell her you called . __eou__ OK . Thanks . __eou__ Bye bye . __eou__
What are you doing ? __eou__ I ’ m just looking for a nice pillow on Ebay . __eou__ You are shopping for a pillow online ? That ’ s absurd ! __eou__ Why ? I don ’ t have to leave the house or browse a dozen stores to find what I ’ m looking for . This way , I just search for it online quick and easy . __eou__ I see , but how do you pay for it ? How do you know you aren ’ t going to be ripped off by the seller ? __eou__ Well , the website handles a point system where if the seller does something wrong , people comment negatively and then you know that he or she may not be trustworthy . __eou__ Wow , that sounds pretty safe . So how do you pay ? Do you need a credit card ? __eou__ You can use a credit card or your debit card . They also let you use the Paypal system which is really safe and fast . I have never had any problems with someone hacking my information or anything . __eou__ Do you think I can find a sweater for my dog online ? __eou__ You can find anything ! Are you sure you want to start shopping online though ? Once you step into this world , there is no turning back ! __eou__ Let ’ s do it ! __eou__
What do you think is harder , reading or writing ? __eou__ Well , they ’ re completely different . Reading is passive , and writing is active . __eou__ I don ’ t think I understand what you mean . Could you explain a little more ? __eou__ In reading you need to recognize language by seeing the words on the page and knowing what they are . In writing you have to produce language , you have to create your own words on a blank page . __eou__ Oh , now I see what you mean . When you ’ re reading , you are just looking , but when you are writing , you are actually doing something ! __eou__ A reading knowledge of a language is larger and different from a writing knowledge . Don ’ t you think so ? __eou__ I think I see what you mean . I can read Shakespeare but I definitely can ’ t write it . __eou__ Exactly . __eou__ So I have another question for you . What do you think is harder , speaking or understanding ? __eou__ They ’ re both harder than reading or writing . __eou__ In what way ? __eou__ Because they are direct communication with another person , and there ’ s a time limit . This time limit is the most serious problem for foreigners , even for those who know lots of English . __eou__ You are making me feel really discouraged . __eou__ I ’ m not trying to discourage you . I ’ m trying to help you . You have to live with these difficulties . Isn ’ t it better to know about them ? The more you know about what you have to face , the better you ’ ll do . I promise ! __eou__
Have you seen this ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ They killed another hostage . __eou__ Oh , how awful . What a terrible thing to do . __eou__ I agree completely . I just don't understand what's wrong with them . Don't they have any humanity ? __eou__ Well , maybe they've got a point . I mean , I suspect that they think the same about us . __eou__ Yes , but that doesn't make them right , does it ? Just because they think so ? __eou__ I guess not . My view is that we should give in to their demands , so that innocent people can stop getting killed . __eou__ Come on , you can't be serious ! We should never give in to terrorist's demands , otherwise where would we be ? __eou__ Well , that's probably true , but I don't think we should be dogmatic about it . A colleague of mine was kidnapped once , so perhaps I have a different view of things . __eou__ Really ? What happened ? __eou__ Well , it was in the Balkans during the war . He was only held for three days , and then they simply released him . It was a case of mistaken identity , and they just let him go when they found out he was no use to them . It was lucky they didn't kill him . __eou__ Oh , sure . __eou__
Where did you get your mobile ? It's really cute . __eou__ Oh , this ? I got it in Singapore . Here , do you want to take a look ? __eou__ Thanks . Gee , it's really light ! __eou__ Yes , it is , isn't it ? A bit too light , really . What make have you got ? __eou__ I've got an old Ericsson . Here . Take a look . __eou__ Wow , that's really old . __eou__ Yes , I like collecting antiques . __eou__ Why don't you get a new one ? __eou__ I don't know . I like this one , and I don't have any need for all the bells and whistles you get on the new ones . __eou__ Really , what makes you say that ? __eou__ Well , I just need to make and receive calls , and it's quite reliable . I find that the more fancy stuff they put into these things , the more likely they are to break bown or go wrong , you know ? I mean , this camera function , for instance-how often do you use it ? __eou__ Sometimes , but I guess not very often . It's more for fun . Sometimes when I'm on a trip , for example , I can take a picture and send it to my kids . Or I can send a picture of a sample back to my office and get it costed up immediately . __eou__ Well , that's nice I guess . So how many kids do you have ? __eou__ Three . Two boys and a girl . __eou__
Tom has grown six inches within a year . __eou__ He has reached puberty . His mind and body both will change a lot . __eou__ Yeah , do you see his Adam's apple ? It becomes bigger . __eou__ Time is flying . I still remember everything when he was a child . __eou__
How about 15 % the first six months and the second six months at 12 % with a guarantee of 3000 units ? __eou__ That's a lot to sell with very low profit margins . __eou__ It's about the best we can do , Smith . We need to hammer something out today . If I go back empty-handed , I may be coming back to you soon to ask for a job . __eou__ OK . 17 % the first six months , 14 % for the second . __eou__ Good . Let's iron out the remaining details . When do you want to take delivery ? __eou__ We'd like you to execute the first order by the 31 st . __eou__ Let me run through this again , the first shipment for 1500 units to be delivered in 27 days by the 31 st . __eou__ Right . We couldn't handle much larger shipments . __eou__ Fine . But I'd prefer the first shipment to be 1000 units , the next 2000 . The 31 st is quite soon , I can't guarantee 1500 . __eou__ I can agree to that . Well , if there's nothing else , I think we've settled everything . __eou__ Tom , this deal promises big returns for both sides . Let's hope it's the beginning of a long and prosperous relationship . __eou__
DM210 is equivalent to 400 RIB . __eou__ Don't you wish to employ RIB of ours ? US Dollars might be adopted . __eou__ Are you afraid of losing money due to exchange rate fluctuations ? __eou__ I will give you a definite answer on the price terms two days later . __eou__
Mary , you have found several companies that are hiring , right ? __eou__ Yes , I have found three companies . __eou__ Have you called to inquire about the positions ? __eou__ Yes , but the results are not so satisfying . __eou__ What's the matter ? __eou__ I asked the first company about the vacancy , but they had already hired someone . __eou__ What a pity ! __eou__ The second one told me that the job information was released half a year ago , and had been overdue . __eou__ It's frustrating ! __eou__ The last company is still hiring , but not recent graduates . __eou__ Wonder why they do that ! __eou__ I feel terrible now . __eou__ Don't be discouraged . Just keep trying and you will find a job eventually . __eou__ Thanks for your support and care . __eou__
Why don't you begin by telling me something about yourself ? __eou__ What do you want to know ? __eou__ The usual , you know , something about your background and experience and anything personal that you feel is pertinent . __eou__ Well , I was born in Shanghai and went to school there , right up through college . My father is a lawyer , and my mother is a teacher . __eou__ Sounds as if you come from a professional family . __eou__ That right . One of my sisters is a doctor and the other one teaches at a university . __eou__ What made you decide to get into computers ? __eou__ Oh , nothing in particular , I guess . I always liked mathematics and tinkering with machines . __eou__ Now what about your experience ? How long have you been working with computers ? __eou__ More than five years now . After I did my engineering degree , I began to specialize in computer technology and I even had my own company for a while . __eou__ It certainly sounds impressive . Why don't you have your credentials sent to me and I'll show them to the board ? We'll probably get back to you in a week . __eou__ Thanks very much . __eou__

How much is the RIB trading at today ? __eou__ It's a shame you didn't come a little earlier , the exchange rate was reset yesterday afternoon . The American dollar is now worth 7.45RMB.If you would like to sell RIB , we can give you a rate of 7.35.Will that be all right ? __eou__ I guess , here , give me 5,000 RIB worth . I might as well exchange a little extra . Who knows what the exchange rate will be tomorrow ! __eou__

And , her mother is definitely the matriarch of the bigger family . __eou__ that ’ s interesting . What does your grandfather think of your step-mother ? __eou__ at first , she was quite critical of her , but now that they ’ Ve been married for a few years , she ’ s starting to accept the fact that my father divorced my mother . __eou__ that ’ s pretty much how you feel about your step-mother .

I don't know what to say . This can't be happening . Here's the obituary . __eou__ It's really there ? This all seems so surreal-like it's all one big nightmare . __eou__ But it explains why Taylor isn't answering and Femi took time off from work . __eou__ Poor Femi . Taylor's death must have made her realize that she still cared for him . __eou__ This says the viewing is at Myers Funeral Home today until five . __eou__ It's already half past four . We should go and pay our respects . Taylor's family will be there . __eou__
Did you watch the old-fashioned wrestling game last night ? __eou__ Yes , of course . And I'm amazed the those karate and judo boys were so helpless before the wrestlers . __eou__ You bet . The wrestlers had got sound defences and they simply couldn't make it . __eou__

You are way too picky ! __eou__ Unfortunately , you won ’ t be getting a rent check unless these problems are fixed by Friday . __eou__ You wouldn ’ t dare do that ! __eou__
That's good to know . We'll watch for crazy drivers . __eou__ Hey , guys . Ready for a pick-up game of touch football ? __eou__ Football ? Sounds dangerous . Maybe I'll just be a cheerleader . __eou__ C'mon , Yi-jun . It's lots of fun . You've seen football played on TV . __eou__ Uh , yeah . And I've seen guys in pads tackled . We have no pads .

My girlfriend will like it . __eou__ It's a beautiful drive . __eou__ Where are the keys ? __eou__ Just a moment , sir . We have to finish filling out the forms . __eou__
Excuse me , can you tell me the name of the book you read ? __eou__ Harry Potter . __eou__ Harry Potter ?

You will like it too . __eou__ I'll try to read it . Actually , I like literature very much . __eou__ Wow , that sounds like a scholar .

Would you like to go to work or continue your studies after graduation ? __eou__ I think I will continue my studies . Now it's not easy for a graduate with bachelor's degree to get a job since there are so many graduates with master's or doctor's degree . We are likely to lose in competing with them in the job market . __eou__ So you will continue to study for a master's degree ? __eou__ Well , I think so . But I am thinking of going aboard to get a master's and doctor's degree . If can get a Ph . D . abroad , it will be much easy for me to get a job at home . __eou__ How can you finance your education abroad ? It is very expensive to study abroad . __eou__ I think I will try to get the scholarship since I really don't have so much money to study abroad . Actually now I am preparing for the TEFL and GRE exams . If I can get high marks in the two exams and if I am lucky enough , I may get a scholarship . __eou__ It could be pretty tough studying abroad . Being so far away from home ... __eou__
The trouble is not that . It is that he may suddenly remember something I promised him a couple of weeks ago , out of a clear blue sky .

He only takes side with him . He seldom asks what Dick is doing . __eou__
Yuck . The carrots taste awful and salty . Hi sis , how do you like them ? __eou__ I like them very much . They are delicious . __eou__ Well , you can have all my carrots . __eou__ Daniel , hold on for a minute . What are you trying to pull there ? __eou__ Nothing . Just that I don't care for these carrots.Hi , sis . , I saw you buy some chocolate cakes . I am done with the main course . It's about time for some dessert . __eou__ Oh , you want my chocolate cakes , so to speak ! __eou__ No , no , I'm just thinking of some dessert . And I have had enough carrots . __eou__ Daniel , carrots contain much Vitamin C . It is good for you . __eou__ I know , but chocolate cake is even better . __eou__ Oh , stop it ! You know you need vegetables . You will end up fat if you don't watch your diet , now . __eou__ Well , actually , I don't mind eating carrots , but chocolate cakes are much better . You know I was born with a sweet tooth . __eou__
Sometimes I think television is too biased . None of them are completely objective . __eou__ That's unavoidable , but think , How would you keep up to date without television ? __eou__ Newspapers or the radio I guess . I just wish TV was more objective . __eou__ Look , you can still learn a lot from watching television , you just need to be smart when you're watching . Filter the information and decide if you believe what you are hearing or not . __eou__ The internet's a lot worse . __eou__ Really ? Why ? __eou__ There's no one moderating it . Anyone around the world can put information onto the net for anyone else to see . The information on the internet is mostly unsubstantiated and you can never know who has written it , or why . A lot of people get conned online . __eou__ Again , you need to think carefully . If you don't trust others online , have nothing to do with them . __eou__

How about you ? __eou__ I am sorry to tell you that I have lost the opportunity . __eou__ Why ? You are so excellent . I think you are the most suitable person for the job . __eou__ Yes , I know I am excellent , but I pay no attention to the etiquette you ’ Ve told me . __eou__ What ? Then what did you do ? __eou__ When I entered the room , I forgot to close the door . Later , I couldn ’ t help smoking , you know I am a heavy-smoker . What ’ s more , I forgot to polish my shoes . There is some dirt on it . __eou__ You are so careless . You know they are the basic rules you should follow before you attend an interview . Do remember not to smoke any more , otherwise , you can ’ t find a job . __eou__ Yes , I know . And next time I must make good preparations . __eou__ Good luck next time . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Mr . Dick . Does the recommendation of the university play an important role ? __eou__ Yes . In fact , the recommendation letter written by the university is an indirect self-recommendation . In the long period of cooperation , the university has established good relationship with the companies or organizations , they trust each other well . If your university recommends you , you can be approved more easily . __eou__ But I find that most of the recommendation letters written by universities are the same . So I doubt its authority . __eou__ More and more persons have the same discoveries since most universities do that in order to save energy . If your university also does like this , you can look for other methods , because such kinds of recommendations say nothing for you . __eou__ Could you tell me whether or not I send out my resume with it ? __eou__ It depends . If it has something special or useful , I suggest you send it out . __eou__

I mean , what payment methods are possible ? __eou__ We can transfer the funds each month , at your request , into each employee's account .

Oh , he said the usual things like “ Keep up the good work ” and “ Thanks for your hard work , ” but he also said that he's thinking about bringing some employees into my department .

Today more and more people advocate lifelong learning . But people have different views about lifelong learning . How do you understand lifelong learning ? __eou__ I think lifelong learning is the concept that it's never too soon or too late for learning __eou__ Does that mean studying all the time ? __eou__ I don't think so .

Lifelong learning is about finding learning opportunities at all ages and in numerous contexts __eou__ Yes , I agree with you . When I retired I will participate in programs to keep momentally active . __eou__ Me too . To keep up with the changing world , one must be involved in lifelong learning and be ready to accept new things . __eou__ You know what ? I've recently been teaching myself French . __eou__ Really ? That's great ! I know that your company has a lot of clients in France . __eou__ Yes , so I want to learn French to develop my career . __eou__

I notice you have a few newspapers there . Would you mind lending me one ? __eou__ no , not at all . Which one would you like--the New York Times or the Guardian ? __eou__ I prefer the British paper , but I'll read whatever one you aren't going to read right away . __eou__ I was just going to do a little Sudoku while we wait for the plane to take off , so the Guardian is all yours . __eou__ thanks a lot .

How can I help you ? __eou__ I was hoping to talk to you today about your business . __eou__ Very well . __eou__ How long have you been the owner of your computer shop ? __eou__ About five years . __eou__ And how many staff do you employ ? __eou__ There is my wife who does the accounts and my brother who helps with the sales . __eou__ So this is a family business . __eou__ Yes , we are a small family business . __eou__ And how many computers do you sell each day ? __eou__ That depends on the day . We sell from here and on the Internet . I would say about twenty to thirty per week . __eou__ That about one hundred a month . __eou__ That's correct . __eou__ Thank you B for your time . __eou__ Thank you and goodbye . __eou__
I really hope to reach an agreement with you today that is suitable and beneficial for us both . I've thought through a lot of these details , and I hope we can have a chance to discuss them and resolve any differences this afternoon . __eou__ Let's get start . What kinds of things do you have in mind ? If you let us know the requirements you have from the very beginning , we can work through each one until we can come to an agreement . __eou__ Firstly , we'd like to discuss a discounted price . If you can give us a discount of 7 % on the high volumes orders , we can pay in 60 days . __eou__ Huh ... I think 7 % is little high that might be hard to do . How about this ? We'll give you a discount of 4 % , but you can have 90 days credits . __eou__ Well , that might be acceptable , if you handle the insurance fees . __eou__ No , you have to take care of the insurance . But we are willing to pay the half transport . Can you accept that ? __eou__ We cover the insurance and half the transport fee , and only have a discount of 4 % . __eou__ But you'll have 90 days to pay your bill and I'll tell you what ... I'll also throw in the discount of 10 % on your up front deposit . __eou__ Done ... __eou__
May we see the wine list please ? __eou__ Sure . Our special wine today is a 1989 Chardonnay . __eou__ That sounds pretty good ! How much is it ? __eou__ It's $ 4.25 cents by the glass . The whole bottle is $ 22.5 . __eou__ I'd like a bottle please . __eou__ I'll need to see your ID please . __eou__ Here you go . __eou__ Sorry about the inconvenience , you look so young . I had make sure you are over 21 years old . __eou__
Do you drink much ? __eou__ Depending on what you consider a lot . __eou__ How frequently do you drink ? __eou__ Couple times a week . How about you ? __eou__ Only when I go out . I'm not a big drinker . __eou__ How much can you drink ? __eou__ I usually only have 2 beers . __eou__ You're a light weight . __eou__ How much can you drink ? __eou__ I'm usually drinking all night long . At least 10 drinks . __eou__ Don't you spend a lot of money then ? __eou__ No . We usually go to places that have specials . Dante's over on the Ave has $ 5.00 pitchers on Mondays . So for ten , fifteen bucks , I can get a lot of drinks . __eou__ That's true . __eou__ If you don't like beer , have you tried mixed drinks ? Some of them are pretty good . __eou__ I like beer , it's just that I get a headache when I drink more than 3 . __eou__ You just have to build up a tolerance . I used to be like that . But your body gets used to it . __eou__ It'll take awhile , but I'm working on it . __eou__ Hey let's go out tomorrow night . The Ram Bar and Grill is having a special on pitchers . __eou__ Alright . __eou__
Do you live in the red house at the end of the road ? __eou__ Yes , I live in that house with my parents and my sister . __eou__ We also have a cat and a dog . __eou__ Do you take your dog for a walk every day ? __eou__ No . My father takes the dog for a walk every Monday , Tuesday and Sunday . __eou__ And I take the dog for a walk every Wednesday , Thursday and Friday . __eou__ Who takes the dog on Saturday ? __eou__ On Saturday we all go to the park and the dog comes with us . __eou__ Do you help with the housework ? __eou__ My mum and my sister do the housework and cooking but I clean my room . __eou__
I'm hungry , let's order up something to eat . __eou__ Ok , maybe we can order a soup and a salad from the restaurant down the street . __eou__ I was thinking of getting a hamburger , fries and a chocolate sundae . __eou__ You eat too much junk food . That sort of stuff clogs up your arteries and is very high in cholesterol . __eou__ Well I never seem to gain weight so I don't mind . __eou__ It's not only about getting fat or not , it's about being healthy . You could really have some health problems later on . __eou__ How about pizza or maybe some fried chicken ! Better yet , let's order some hot dogs ! __eou__ You are a lost cause . __eou__
Wow . That girl who brings the fruit is really pretty ! I wish she wouldn't have rushed off so fast ... __eou__ Hey , it's an English song ! Sing with us , Ryan ! __eou__ " Tie a Yellow Ribbon on the Old Oak Tree " ? ! Where did you learn that song ? __eou__ Everyone in Taiwan knows it . Come on ! Sing with us ! __eou__ I'm sorry , but I can't ! That's something my grandmother would sing ! __eou__
I've heard that you've made a new strange friend recently , Sophie . __eou__ Yes . He is an old man with a great sense of humour . Not only can he play the piano , he also draws pictures very well . __eou__ So you can learn a lot from him . __eou__ Yeah , he has no children , so he sometimes feel s very lonely . I often go to his house to play and talk with him . That makes him feel very happy . __eou__

Did you keep on a diet ? __eou__ No , you know I can't bear eating less . __eou__ Then do the slim pills take effect on you ? __eou__ I've quit it already . I go to aerobics class everyday instead . __eou__ How's it going on ? __eou__ You see . I've lost my weight in spite of my good appetite . __eou__ I'd better exercise my body too .

Hurry up ! Mom , I can't wait any more . __eou__ Look out , honey . Let's come to the shoal waters . Follow me ! __eou__ OK , Mom . Can I swim now ? I want to learn butterfly stroke . __eou__ Honey , listen to me . First , you should learn how to breathe in and breathe out . __eou__ Mom , it's so terrible . Water went down into my throat and I almost got drowned . __eou__ Do be patient , Honey . Let's do it slowly and correctly . __eou__ Oh , Mom , I think I'm not the right person for swimming . __eou__ Come on , sweetie , you've done very well . It is the first step that is tough . __eou__ Right , I'll make up my mind . Please correct me if any of my movements go wrong . __eou__ Yes , well done . That's the way to go . How clever you are ! You've got it . __eou__ Really ? I can't believe it . Everything is possible to a willing heart . __eou__ Exactly , next , you should hold your legs together and extend your arms above your head . __eou__ Yes , like a dolphin . Am I on the right track ? __eou__ That's the way to go . Now , you are flying , my boy . __eou__

It's a cell phone , camera , PAD and mp3 player all in one . __eou__ if I had enough money , I'd buy one , but I don't even have enough to buy one of their shuffle spods . __eou__ how big is a shuffle iPod ? __eou__ the first generation iPod shuffle is about the size of a park of gum and the second generation iPod shuffle is about half the size of the first . __eou__ how many gigs of music can it hold ? __eou__ I think it's either one or two gigs . I can't remember . __eou__ how much do they cost ? __eou__ not much at all . I think it's about 100 dollars . __eou__ you're right , that's not bad at all . __eou__ do you have an iPod ? __eou__ I got one for my birthday when they first came out , but after the battery died out , I never brought another one . __eou__ why didn't you just buy another battery for it so you could use it ? __eou__ that's one of the problems with having an iPod . Though an iPod might have an above average battery life , once the battery is dead , so is your iPod . __eou__
I would like to know is it a direct flight to Dubai ? __eou__ Sorry . No . You need to transfer to a connect flight in the middle . __eou__ Too bad . I hate transferring during a flight . It is too complex . __eou__ You have to do it . But it takes only about 30 minutes . __eou__ Really ? It used to cost a few hours . __eou__ It has become more time saving . __eou__ Ok . Good . I want two side by side tickets in the Economy cabinet . Thank you . __eou__
Here we are , Room 215 . __eou__ It is very nice . __eou__ The telephone is by the end . Dial 0 for reception . __eou__ Can I order room service ? __eou__ Yes , here's the menu .

OK , so this is our newest machine . It was only installed last year . __eou__ What's the running speed of the machine ? __eou__ About 1,500 metres per minute . It's one of the fastest in the world . We had a few problems with it after start-up but it's running very well now . __eou__ And what's the maximum output ? __eou__ If we're running at full capacity , it's 160,000 tonnes per annum . __eou__
What's your plan for your future ? __eou__ I'd like to work in a law firm to enrich my experience and put what I've learned into practice . __eou__ Have you had any previous experience ? __eou__ Well . During the college years , I worked as a trainee every summer at lawyer's offices . Does that count ? __eou__ Of course it counts . What kind of work did you do there ? __eou__ I did clerical stuff and ran errands . __eou__ In this office , we encourage full attendance by offering a bonus . If you take any leaves , we'll deduct money from your salary . __eou__ May I know about the office hours ? __eou__ Office hours are nine to five-thirty . One hour for lunch . Do you have any questions ? __eou__ Er , may I know how much I will be paid monthly ? __eou__ We'll give you about 3000 to start . There'll be a trial period of three month . After six months , we'll have a job performance review and consider giving you a raise . __eou__ When will I know your decision ? __eou__ I'll call you in a day or two , did you write down your phone number on your resume ? __eou__ Yes , I did . Can you call after 7 p . m . ? I'm usually out in the daytime . __eou__ All right . Good-bye . __eou__ Good-bye . __eou__
How is your English ability ? __eou__ Not bad . I ’ m proficient in both written and spoken English . __eou__ English and computer skills are comparatively important to this position , especially in the starting period . What ’ s your ability in these two fields ? __eou__ I passed College English Test Band 6 , with good skill in listening , speaking , reading , and writing . I haven't got any certificate of computer skills , because I don ’ t think certificates are necessary if what ’ s needed is merely operating a computer . I think practically , to know how to use a computer is more important . And I am quite familiar with Microsoft Office . __eou__ What else do you have to prove your English ability ? __eou__ I took a part-time job last semester in translating and doing reception work for an exhibition . My work included hosting the visiting foreign exhibitors , communicating with them , arranging their agenda , and translating several materials . I think this activity well demonstrated my ability in English . And I will be glad to take any form of English test you arrange for me to prove my ability . __eou__ How do you deal with those who you think are difficult to work with ? __eou__ I stick to my principles and keep to the rules . Sometimes , they just lack enthusiasm . When I get them involved with something constructive , some of them change their attitude later . __eou__ Yes , I see . __eou__
This facility is great , don't you think ? __eou__ Yes , it is better than last year . They have done a very good job this time . __eou__ I'm glad our booth is on the first floor . More people can see our display . __eou__ If someone wants to find us , they can look at this floor plan.It shows where all the companies have their booths . __eou__ Let me see that . I didn't get one when I came in . __eou__ Really ? They didn't give you one with your ticket ? __eou__ No . __eou__ That's strange . __eou__ Where do you go for lunch around here ? __eou__ Are you hungry ? __eou__ Not too bad . But I will be soon . __eou__ I went across the street . There is a good Chinese restaurant next to the hotel . __eou__ I can't see Cortex on this floor plan . Don't they have a booth here ? __eou__ They must . Let me look at that.Here it is . Cortex . It's on the second floor , next to the Roll booth . __eou__ Oh , that will be uncomfortable for them . __eou__ For whom ? Cortex ? __eou__ Yes . Cortex just stole Darren McDowell from Rolly.And probably Darren will be here.So he will have to spend the whole show standing next to his old Cortex coworkers . __eou__ I've never met Darren.But you're right . That would probably be uncomfortable . __eou__ When you reserve a booth , you should check who your neighbors will be.Don ' t you think ? __eou__ Yes , maybe . If you're Darren McDowell , you should probably check . __eou__ Yes . Well , I think I'll go get lunch . Will you join me ? __eou__ No , I'll stay here at the booth . I ate earlier . Are you going to the Chinese restaurant ? __eou__ Maybe . I will look around . __eou__
Medicine Industry , this is Peter Bush speaking , can I help you ? __eou__ Good afternoon , could you connect this call with Mr Brown , please __eou__ May I know who's calling ? __eou__ This is Li Ping of ABC computer company limited . I'm calling on our Mr Wilson the general manager of our company . __eou__ I'm sorry , Mrs Li , Mr Brown is now in a meeting.May I have your number , and ask him to call you back later ? __eou__ I'm afraid Mr Wilson would like to speak to Mr Brown right now.He ' s got an urgent matter to discuss with Mr Brown without delay . __eou__ Ok , then would you please hold the line ? Mr Li , the line is through , Mr Brown is ready answering the call , go ahead . __eou__ Thank you for your assistance , Mr Bush . __eou__ You are welcome . __eou__
The portions here are man sized . We usually end up taking half of the meal home with us . __eou__ Everything looks so good . Is there anything in particular that you recommend ? __eou__ Hey , sis . You know me , if I don't like everything on the menu , I don't go back to the restaurant ! __eou__ So you're saying I can't go wrong with anything I order ? In that case ... __eou__ Wait , you love salmon , don't you ? They have the best salmon pasta . __eou__ That sounds really good ! Does it come with a soup ? __eou__ Soup and bread and salad bar ! I'm telling you , these people know how to keep you coming back ! __eou__ I see what you mean ! __eou__
Mom , what were movies like when you were a kid ? __eou__ Everything about them was different , even the theaters . __eou__ I'm really interested . Tell me about them . __eou__ Well , where I grew up , we saw movies at a drive-in theater in our car with the whole family . __eou__ That's cool . I bet you could bring your own food . __eou__ We did . On hot days , we'd take a blanket and lay in the back of dad's old pickup to watch the movie . __eou__ Why don't we do that anymore ? __eou__ Well , the weather might have some influence , during bad weather the theater didn't make a whole lot . __eou__
Daddy , I am so glad you come out with us . __eou__ Honey , I am sorry that I am too busy most of the time . __eou__ It doesn't matter . But I really haven't gone for a picnic for a long time . __eou__ What did you do last weekend ? __eou__ It was boring . Just did my homework and practiced the piano . __eou__ Did you play football with other children ? __eou__ Ahh , I was not available last Sunday . I was too busy almost as much as you . __eou__ Cool , we can take the football , shuttlecock and badminton racket to the park . __eou__ Hooray ! I can play football with daddy . Mom and sister can play badminton . __eou__ After that , we will have a picnic . __eou__ That's great . We can also take the dragon kite with us . After the picnic , we can fly it . __eou__ Okay , it sounds good . __eou__
I ’ Ve just found a mouse in the house ! __eou__ Ow ! Don ’ t shout so loud . Calm down . Please stop shouting and sit quietly down . __eou__ I found a mouse in our house , a grown mouse running around the dinning room . __eou__ Where is it now ? __eou__ It ’ s under the couch . __eou__ Now , move the couch around and turn it upside down . __eou__ Ok , I don ’ t want a mouse in our house . We have the tidiest house in the town . __eou__ Yes darling . You are quite right . __eou__
we are going out for dinner tonight . Are you coming , Betty ? __eou__ I'm not sure . I have to check my schedule . Where are you going ? __eou__ oh , Jake made a reservation at Friday's . __eou__ Jack ? __eou__ yes , the one with the R $ D team . Is that a problem ? __eou__ I will never go out with him anymore . __eou__ why did you say so ? __eou__ last time when we had dinner at the Smith's , it was a horrible experience . He had no manners at all ! __eou__ oh , really ? __eou__ he made a lot of noises while eating . He talked with his mouth full and sipped loudly . __eou__ are you kidding me ? How could he behave like that ? __eou__ it is true . Everyone kept looking at him . It was so embarrassing as I was sitting right next to him . __eou__ what a shame ! Didn't he realized that ? __eou__ I have no idea . He seemed to enjoy the dinner very much . __eou__ maybe he should really something about eating etiquette . __eou__ oh , he really should . __eou__
Hello , Bessie . __eou__ Hello , Jack.Happy birthday ! __eou__ My birthday ? I forgot it , Thank you for remembering my birthday . __eou__ I'd like to offer you my congratulations on your birthday and best wishes for your future happiness , good health and continued success . I've asked the Fairy Flowers to send you a bunch of flowers . I hope you'll like them . __eou__ Thanks a lot . I'm so touched . __eou__ Now let me sing " Happy birthday " for you . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__
Hey , Zina . You're here early today . __eou__ Yeah , I'm going to be making phone calls all day . What a blast . __eou__ I just wanted to say thanks for putting us on the map so fast . I appreciate it . __eou__ Save it , Vince . After I put my first million in the bank , I'll say you're welcome . __eou__ Fair enough.Keep up the good work . __eou__
Did you hear how cold it got last night ? __eou__ I heard the radio announcer say it was 18 degrees below zero . __eou__ It was so cold this morning . I could hardly start my car . __eou__ My car didn't want to start either at first . __eou__ Don't you have a garage ? __eou__ Not in the new apartment . We have to leave the car in the parking lot . __eou__ How much antifreeze did you put in your new car then ? You must have to keep it well below zero . __eou__ I do . Right now I have it protected up to 30 below zero . __eou__ Does it ever get that cold on here ? __eou__ Not really . It sometimes gets to 20 below . __eou__ Speaking of cold , how about going for a cup of coffee to warm up . __eou__
Where do you want to go this weekend ? __eou__ Let's go to the lake and camp on the south side . __eou__ Do you want to take the jet ski ? __eou__ Let's just rent one this time .

Renting is good ! __eou__ Should we call the Olsen's and ask them if they want to join us ? __eou__ Okay , you call them . __eou__ Then you go out to the garage and check out the camping gear . __eou__
Northward Airways , good morning . May I help you ? __eou__ Yes , do you have any flights to Sydney next Tuesday afternoon ? __eou__ One moment , please ... Yes . There's a flight at 16:45 and one at 18:00 . __eou__ That's fine . Could you tell me how much a return flight costs ? I'll be staying three weeks . __eou__ Economy , business class or first class ticket ? __eou__ Economy , please . __eou__ That would be 346 Euro . __eou__ OK . Could I make a reservation ? __eou__ Certainly . Which flight would you like ? __eou__ The 16:45 , please . __eou__ Could I have your name , please ? __eou__ My name is Mary Jones , that's M-A-R-Y J-O-N-E-S . __eou__ How would you like to pay , Ms .

Can I help you , sir ? __eou__ Hello , may I make an appointment for sometime early this afternoon ? __eou__ I'm sorry . All the appointments are filled . __eou__ Oh , what a pity . I'd like to see the doctor as soon as possible . I have a sharp pain in my chest . __eou__ Let me see ... Perhaps I could fit you in at five thirty . __eou__ Five thirty ? I have a dinner appointment at six . __eou__ What about tomorrow morning , then ? __eou__ No . I can't wait . I feel awful . The dinner appointment has to be canceled . __eou__ I guess it can't be helped . __eou__ You are right . Did you say 5:30 ? I'll make a note of it . Fine . __eou__ All right , then . See you this afternoon . __eou__ How kind of you ! Good-bye . __eou__
Mrs . Phoebe , let's talk about the delivery arrangement for our goods . __eou__ Sure . What's your date of delivery ? __eou__ I informed my company and was told that the first five thousand by the end of this month . __eou__ What about the balance of the order ? Can they also arrive at our company quickly ? __eou__ We can deliver the balance at the price already quoted in 10 days . __eou__ Can you deliver them earlier ? __eou__ I am afraid we can not do that . Would you be willing to sign an annual contract on the basis we discussed ? __eou__ Possibly , subject to quality and delivery guarantees . __eou__ Of course . Well , in that case we could offer a 5 % discount for a confirmed monthly order for the next 12 months . __eou__ I was looking forward to something a bit more substantial . As you know , we have long-time cooperation . __eou__ I'm afraid that's as far as we could go . We'd already be stretching ourselves to the limit . __eou__ Well , let's shake on that and draw up the details of the contract . __eou__
Quality is very important to us . We work to very low tolerance levels . We need to have guaranteed supplies of consistently high quality raw materials . Over the years we've built up very good relationships with our suppliers . __eou__ Do you have many different suppliers ? __eou__ Yes . There are about fifty names on our approved supplier list , but for raw materials we tend to deal with three local companies . __eou__
I've read your report , and I'm not sure I agree with you.You think you can get attendance improved by requiring salaried employees to take their all of their sick days ? __eou__ That's right . I know it must sound crazy to you , but we believe there will be fewer absences this way . __eou__ We give them 10 or 15 sick days per year . Surely requiring people to take them couldn't possibly help . It sounds like a counter - productive policy change to me . __eou__ Right now , we have incentives encouraging employees to come to work as often as possible.But employees with colds and the flu are coming to work and infecting their colleagues . __eou__ I see . So our current policies are encouraging sick people to come to work , resulting in more sick employees . __eou__ That's right . If sick days were mandatory , sick people would stay home . We wouldn't have these company-wide epidemics . __eou__ Let's give it a shot ! __eou__
Good afternoon , you look a little stuck . Can I help ? __eou__ The thing is , I've got all of this information here , all of these leaflets , but I can't make head nor tail of them ! __eou__ I see . What is it exactly that you are interested in ? __eou__ I'm not sure which would be better for me ; buying some insurance or putting my money in a Savings Deposit . __eou__ Well , that all depends on how much you want to invest . __eou__ I was thinking of around 10,000 RIB . __eou__ That's a nice round figure to deal with ! OK , if you were to buy this insurance policy , your yearly fixed income from it would be 94.35 RIB . __eou__ And for the Savings Deposit ? __eou__ For the Savings Deposit you could actually get more . You see , in time deposit , the interest rate is 1.58 % after the 20 % interest tax . So , technically you could get more than a third more . __eou__ Wow ! A third more ? Very good . __eou__
Flip it to channel 9 , will you , Janet ? There's a big basketball game on in a couple of minutes . __eou__ Sorry , turkey . I have already got dibs on the TV for tonight , remember ? And I'm watching ' Disco Fever ' on channel 6 . __eou__ Oh , yeah , smarty-pants ? Over my dead body . Now , don't be such a brat and ... __eou__ Hey , what's wrong with the TV ? __eou__ I don't know ! The picture went blank all of a sudden . It's probably the picture tube . __eou__ Looks like the TV wins that argument . __eou__ Yeah . Oh well , how about a game of cards instead ? __eou__ Sure , why not ? __eou__
Excuse me , I ’ d like to buy a guitar.Could you recommend one ? __eou__ Sure.Do you want an acoustic one or an electric one ? __eou__ An acoustic one . __eou__ Are you looking to get a steel-string or a classical ? __eou__ What ’ s the difference ? __eou__ Well , a classical guitar has nylon strings and its neck is bigger than a steel-string guitar ’ s.It ’ s best suited for finger picking . A steel-string is best for playing chords . __eou__ I ’ m mainly interested in learning to play rhythm guitar . __eou__ In that case , I ’ d suggest a steel-string guitar.The best one we have is the Ovation . __eou__ This one ’ s a little too expensive for me . I ’ d prefer something cheaper for now.When I ’ Ve learned to play , I might get a better one . __eou__ In that case , how about this one ? It ’ s inexpensive but it ’ s still well made and easy to play . __eou__ Hmm.All right , I ’ ll take it , and this book on how to play the guitar as well . __eou__ You should also get a couple of guitar picks . __eou__ Oh , right.Thanks for your help . __eou__ Don ’ t mention it . __eou__
I want to know how to buy something from this machine . __eou__ Yeah , the new ones can be tricky . What are you trying to buy ? __eou__ I want to buy one of those snack things . __eou__ Are you ready to go ? __eou__ I'm clear so far . __eou__ The money goes in the slot over there . It has to be smooth to go in . __eou__ It won't go in ! __eou__ Just remember that you might have to feed the money in a couple of times to get it to work . __eou__ Yes , next step . __eou__ Make your selection and hope for the best . Vending machines aren't all that reliable . __eou__ They're totally unreliable . __eou__ You seem to have it down . Have a good day ! __eou__
Jack I hear you have a chance to go to college without taking a test . Is that right ? __eou__ The news goes so fast . Ah , yes , I haven't decided yet . __eou__ Don't hesitate . That's a very famous university which a lot of students are longing to attain . __eou__ Maybe you are right . But the major is not fit for me . I like architecture more than computers . __eou__ But this chance is really precious . __eou__ Well , I know . So I am thinking now . __eou__ I hope you can make a clever choice . Anyway , the opportunities around you are not that By . __eou__ Thank you for your kindness . I will think about it carefully . __eou__
What sport do you like the most ? __eou__ I like baseball the best . __eou__ Me too . Did you play when you were a kid ? __eou__ Yeah . I played until I graduated from high school . __eou__ What position did you play ? __eou__ I think I tried every position , but the last few years , I played third base . __eou__ I hate third base . It's scary when the ball is coming at you so fast . __eou__ It was scary at first , but after awhile , I got used to it . If you have fast reflexes , then it's not really a problem . What position did you play ? __eou__ I played outfield . I hated the infield because I never figured out all the bounces . __eou__ I wish I could play again , but there isn't much opportunities around here . __eou__ I'm on a softball league . It's not fast pitch , but it's still fun . You wanna join our group ? __eou__ When do you guys play ? __eou__ We play either Tuesdays or Thursdays . __eou__ Sounds pretty fun . I'll come out and join you next time . __eou__
I feel confused by all the diet options out there . I don ’ t know which one actually works . __eou__ Most of them are not so practical . It will be very bad for your health if you skip lunches or supers as the recommended . I think making an exercise plan can be more effective . __eou__ Maybe you ’ re right . It is very expensive to go to a weight-loss center . I ’ d better join in a fitness club . __eou__ You don ’ t need to lose weight , you are not fat . __eou__ I bought an exercise dress yesterday and I found it was hard to dress it up . __eou__
Is this your umbrella , miss ? __eou__ Oh , yes , it is . Thank you . I was looking for it just now . __eou__ You look a bit familiar to me . I wonder if I have seen you somewhere before . __eou__ Have you ? __eou__ May I ask where you live ? __eou__ Just two blocks away , in that tall building . __eou__ That ’ s it . I live there , too . I live on the sixth floor . __eou__ My family move in just two weeks ago . We live on the fourth floor . __eou__ It ’ s a small world ! May I know your name , miss ? __eou__ I ’ m Chen Ming . __eou__ How do you do , Miss Chen ? I ’ m Song Mei . __eou__ I ’ m glad to meet you , Mr . Song . __eou__ Are you going to your office now , Miss Chen ? __eou__ No , I ’ m going to the airport to meet some friends from Beijing . __eou__
The consignments of chemical instruments have just reached us . We have to lodge a claim against you for inferior quality I am afraid . __eou__ Is there anything wrong ? __eou__ We bought 1,000 sets of chemical instruments from you , but there are 40 not up to the standard . __eou__ It's hard for us to believe it . Our instruments have been the best quality for years . Have you any reliable evidence ? __eou__ Here is the survey report from a well-known public surveyor in London . You may inspect the defective instruments personally __eou__ Well . According to the contract , we are responsible for repairing or replacing those defective instruments . We ’ ll send our technicians to repair them . __eou__ Forty faulty instruments means that 4 % are not up to the standard . You should compensate us for 4 % of the total account on the contract , as well as for the inspection fee . __eou__ I am sorry about the quality problem , but I propose we compensate you for 3 % of the total value apart from the inspection fee . __eou__ All right . In that case we are still willing to do business with you . __eou__
Can I borrow five bucks ? __eou__ No ! __eou__ Come on ! I'll pay you back on Tuesday . __eou__ Last time I lent you money , you never paid me back . __eou__ I promise if you lend me five dollars today , I will repay you in full next week . __eou__ Ok , but I'm taking your skateboard as collateral . __eou__ Fine ! I can't believe you don't trust me . __eou__ It's nothing personal , just business . __eou__
so , how's your course going ? Do you like it ? __eou__ i like my professors and the classes , but it's a lot of work . __eou__ what are you specializing in ? __eou__ right now , I'm doing some research into the languages of different African tribes . __eou__ that sounds really interesting . Can you speak Swahili ? __eou__ yes , I learned how to speak it when I was little . __eou__ really ? How did you do that ? __eou__ well , I grew up in Africa , so I learned quite a few different languages . __eou__ that's amazing . Are you doing well in your classes ? __eou__ I don't know because I haven't received my test results yet . __eou__ when did you take your exams ? __eou__ about two weeks ago . __eou__ how do you think you did ? __eou__ I left feeling pretty confident about my score , but I heard that my professors are very strict graders , so I'm a bit nervous . __eou__ I'm sure you'll do well . Did you study hard ? __eou__ You know me ; I'm always studying ! __eou__ don't worry . If you don't do well , no one can ! __eou__ Thanks for the vote of confidence , Justin ! __eou__
Did you watch the movie program on Channel 6 last night ? __eou__ Yes , I did . It is a horrible movie . __eou__ I wonder why TV programs often show much violence . __eou__ Actually , more and more people have realized that violence on TV may lead to the increase of crime rates among teenagers . __eou__ They are especially harmful to teenagers . __eou__ But anyhow there are many worthwhile programs . __eou__
Hey Jack . What's going on ? __eou__ Hey Matt . I'm going to ask Martha to marry me ? __eou__ Really ? When did you decide this ? __eou__ I always knew she was the one , but I decided to pop the big question about 2 weeks ago . I'm just debating on how to do it . __eou__ That's exciting , man . __eou__ So how did you propose ? __eou__ You shouldn't use my example . It wasn't special . I kind of wish I made it more special but it's too late now . __eou__ What do you think I should do ? __eou__ There are a lot of options . You can surprise her over dinner , or ask her in a public area , or if you have the balls , ask her father in front of her . __eou__ I never thought about that . __eou__ Thought about what ? __eou__ Asking her father in front of her . How do you think she will react ? __eou__ I don't know . You should know how she's going to react . She is your girlfriend . __eou__ I think that's the idea I was looking for . Thanks , man . __eou__ Don't mention it . Good luck . You're going to need it . __eou__
I could get along fine without all the office politics . __eou__ What's going on ? __eou__ There is a position I've had my eye on for several months now and I had good reason to believe that it was mine for the asking . __eou__ So what happened ? __eou__ We were awarded government funding last year and in order to keep it we have to hire so Ay new employees . __eou__ So what does that have to do with this position ? __eou__ Someone in the main office has a nephew who he thinks can slide right into the Management position I wanted . __eou__ All under the precept of keeping the funding ? That stinks . __eou__
Have you gone bowling before ? __eou__ No . Could you tell me something more about it ? I want to play well . __eou__ There are 10 frames in a bowling game . Each player is allowed to bowl two balls in each frame . __eou__ You just said 10 rounds . __eou__ ' Round ' and ' frame ' are two different terms . __eou__ Perhaps you can tell me a little more about this . __eou__ Hey , slow down . I'll tell you more while playing . __eou__
What a lovely day , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it's nice and bright . __eou__ I hope it stays like this . __eou__ I hope so too . __eou__ Is the weather usually like this here ? __eou__ It's usually a bit hotter than today . __eou__ What's the weather like in winter ? __eou__ It's pretty cold and it often snows . __eou__ I wonder what it ’ s going to be like tomorrow . __eou__ Let's hear the weather report later . What's the weather like in your hometown ? __eou__ Neither too cold , nor too hot . __eou__ That's quite a lovely weather . __eou__ Yes , especially in spring . __eou__ Have you ever seen a hurricane ? __eou__ Once , when I was a child . __eou__ Do they often happen in your country ? __eou__ Now and then . __eou__ Oh , it's time for the weather reporter .

Second , your superiority in sales and profits in addition to the amount of capital and the number of employees . Third , the diversity in your production line is second to none . __eou__ In what business are you most interested in this organization ? __eou__ In particular , I'm interested in marketing in the domestic field . __eou__

Most health food are good for you , but don't taste good . __eou__ Do you prepare some dessert for me ? __eou__ I am clear about your sweet tooth , so I made a mixed fruit dish for you . __eou__ Are you trying to change our eating patterns ? __eou__
Mom , where are you going ? __eou__ I am going to buy some food to cook for supper . __eou__ Good . I wanna come with you . __eou__ How strange !

It's dark outside , Let's hurry up . __eou__
You want to go get a facial with me today ? __eou__ Dude , what are you talking about ? Only girls do that . __eou__ Not at all , guys also get facials , manicures and pedicures . There is nothing wrong with looking after your skin and looking good . __eou__ True . So what do they do to you at your beauty spa ? __eou__ Well , first they exfoliate my face , getting rid of all the dead skin . Then I get a face mask with nutrients that keep my skin healthy and young . Afterwards , they apply some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a million bucks . __eou__ That doesn't really sound like something I would be interested in . In any case , I just wash my face every night and use sunscreen during the day . __eou__ Well you should come with me one day , I'm sure you'll love it . __eou__ Uh ... no . __eou__
What do you think about studying in the U . S . ? __eou__ Well , for many international students , coming to the United States and living here and studying can be quite a daunting experience , especially when finding a house on campus or off campus . __eou__ Do you have any advice ? __eou__ I think first of all for first-time students , coming and living on campus in dormitories can provide a certain level of security . __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ Uh , when you live off campus , there might be a certain amount of flexibility in choosing roommates that you might not have when living on campus . __eou__ I will think over your advice . __eou__ Well , of course , the choice is up to you . Good luck ! __eou__ I really appreciate your help . __eou__
Are you ok ? You seem a bit anxious . __eou__ Yeah , I'm OK , I have been having a lot of mood swings lately . I think it has to do with the pills my doctor prescribed that are causing chaos on my hormones . __eou__ So you mean you feel ecstatic one minute and then blue the next ? __eou__ Yeah , it's weird . For example just this morning I was feeling detached and lonely , even though there was really no reason to feel that way . __eou__ Well , maybe your mood will swing positively and you will feel confident , brave and hopeful ! __eou__ I hope you are right . __eou__

Hello , welcome to Credit Services . How can we help you ? __eou__ I'm interested in applying for a credit card with you . __eou__ Are you an existing customer ? __eou__ Yes , I've had a Current Account with a debit card with you for years . Now , I'm looking at upgrading to a credit card . __eou__ May I ask why you didn't think of applying for a credit card with us sooner ? Most young people jump at the chance . __eou__ When I opened the account with you , I was a student , I graduated a couple of years ago and have a steady salary , so I figured now would be the best time to go ahead . __eou__ That's very sensible of you . We have many fresh graduates applying for credit cards , getting them and then going on a spending spree and being unable to meet the repayments . __eou__ As you can see from the statements for my Current Account , I have never been overdrawn . I'm always very careful about that . __eou__

We need to elect club officials before the summer starts . __eou__ I guess we should start with nominees first . __eou__ Let's make it the first item of business in our next meeting . __eou__ We should probably let everyone know ahead of time so they will be prepared . __eou__ Can you take care of sending out a bulletin by e-mail to all the club members ? __eou__ Yes , I can do that this afternoon . __eou__ Let's schedule the actual election times the week after the nominations .

Did you ever take History 231 ? __eou__ Yeah . Last semester . __eou__ Who was the professor ? __eou__ It was Professor Johnson . __eou__ I have him this semester . What do you think about him ? __eou__ He's a terrible instructor and demands a lot , but fortunately , he's an easy grader . __eou__ What did you end up getting ? __eou__ I got an A - . Sounds good , but none of my test scores were that high , so I don't know how I got a decent grade . __eou__ That's probably because he grades on a curve . __eou__ Are you enjoying the class so far ? __eou__ I hate it and I was about to withdrawal . But after hearing your experience , I think I will tough it out . __eou__ Yes . Definitely stay in the class . You will get a better grade than your test scores . He does that deliberately to make all the students study a lot . __eou__ Thanks for letting me know . I feel relieved now . __eou__

It seems that only it can blossom in the cold winter . __eou__ You have a perfect taste ! __eou__ It is the symbol of laughing at hoar frost and fighting with snow . I admire the bravery of plum blossoms . __eou__ But it used to be ignored by many people . __eou__ The bright people will remember it forever . __eou__ Well , it's snowing . Let's enjoy the plum blossoms when snowing . __eou__
Annie , what is troubling you ? You look unhappy . __eou__ A man is pursuing me . He was my schoolmate in college , and he has been carrying a torch for me for three years . __eou__ Do you like him ? __eou__ Yes , I do like him . __eou__ Then why are you hesitating ? __eou__ You know that I have had a series of miserable relationships .

I just can't set my mind at rest because of the child . She's little . She cannot understand us and accept such truth . __eou__ Yeah , child is the matter .

Last week , we had a performance review on all the staff in our department in last quarter . Stevens , can you provide more information about the performance review ? __eou__ Yes , sir . Most of us had positive review in last quarter . Take Fred and David for examples . Both of them try their best to achieve the best .

Did you put this morning's faxes on my desk ? I'm waiting for some urgent faxes from headquarters , I'm pretty sure they came in last night . __eou__ Everything that came in off the fax machine last night is all on your desk . But I noticed that some of the faxes came through pretty blurred . Maybe you can take a look at them . If the copy is unreadable , I'll call them and ask them to relax . __eou__ Yeah , you're going to have to call them and get them to be re-faxed . These copies are so dark , I can't make out any of the words . __eou__ What about that one ? __eou__ This one ? This one is so light I can barely read it . How can that be ? __eou__ You know , I think the fax machine is out of toner , I can change the toner cartridge . That should solve the problem . __eou__ Yes , but this one will have to be re-faxed as well . And look , there's about three pages missing ! It looks loke the fax machine ate half my important faxes , and the ones that made it through are so blurred or too light , they're unreadable ! __eou__ I guess the fax machine is out of paper , too . Don't worry , I'll have someone look at it this afternoon , and in the meantime , I'll have your documents re-faxed to our other fax machine . __eou__

In fact , prior to their boarding the bus and their getting off the bus , I will make an announcement to remind them that they should check their belongings . __eou__ Well , it seems that you have all the practical experience to handle these cases . I am very glad to welcome you into our company . __eou__ Thank you . It's my honor . __eou__
Hello , Frank . __eou__ Hi , Steven . What's new with you ? __eou__ Not too much . I'm looking to rent an apartment . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ I dislike my roommate . He really turns me off . __eou__ What happened ? Did you have a fight ? __eou__ No . He likes to leave his things about and never cleans the room . __eou__ I hate that , either . Did you tell him your feelings ? __eou__ Yes . But he doesn't care . I really wouldn't want to move , but I simply can ’ t stand him . __eou__ It's a problem . You'd better move . __eou__
Can you help me set up my voicemail message ? I just got this service and I am not really sure what I am supposed to say . __eou__ Sure ! You just basically gotta let the caller know who they called , and ask them for their contact information so you can call them back . __eou__ Ok , so can I say , " This is Abby's voicemail . I will call you later , so leave me your name and number " . __eou__ That's more or less the idea , but try something that sounds more friendly . __eou__ Ok , so how about this , " This is Abby and I am really happy you called ! I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can , so please leave me your name and number . Talk to you soon ! " . __eou__ A little too friendly Abby . Just say this , " Hi , you have reached Abby . I am unable to answer your call right now , but if you leave me your name and phone number , I will get back to you as soon as possible . Thanks " . __eou__ That's perfect ! Can you say that again and record it for me ? __eou__
Only one . But I wanted to make sure I'd get it . __eou__ Yeah , I really wanted that Chanel bag , too . But just in case you should bid low . __eou__ But there are only two more days until the bidding closes ! __eou__ I bid on a Chanel watch at the last minute , and got it sixty percent off ! __eou__ Oh ... I'm such a newbie . But at least I'm sure I'll get that tennis racket . __eou__ Don't count on it , Babe . eBay is always full of surprises . __eou__ Well ... guess how low the bidding starts on the tennis racket ? __eou__
What is this ? I didn't order that . __eou__ I ’ m terribly sorry . May I have your order again ? I'll get it right away . __eou__ I've ordered savory pork and coleslaw . __eou__ I'm sorry .

Hi Mark . __eou__ Oh , hi Stacy . __eou__ How was your summer vacation ? __eou__ I worked over the summer at a restaurant . Have to make tuition money , right ? What did you do ? __eou__ I took summer school . I withdrew from two of my classes last year so I wanted to make them up . __eou__ So are you officially a junior now ? __eou__ Yeah . And I have 5 credits to spare . I only needed to take 10 credits over the summer , but I took 15 because the price was the same . __eou__ That makes sense . So where is Nicole ? __eou__ She dropped out of school completely . __eou__ Really ? Why ? __eou__ She worked at a startup company as an intern and since the business did well , they asked her if she wanted to work full time . __eou__ Wow . She's so lucky . She doesn't have a degree and she already has a job . __eou__ It sounds good now , but I'm traditional . I want the degree , so I wouldn't have accepted the offer . __eou__ Do you know how much they are paying her ? __eou__ I don't know . But I bet it must have been a good offer , or she wouldn't have accepted it . __eou__
For the 100th anniversary of the opening of the library we are going to have a party . __eou__ That's a wonderful way to celebrate this grand old library ! __eou__ I hoped you would be willing to brainstorm with me for party ideas . __eou__ That is right up my alley . You say party and I'm there . __eou__ Perfect . It will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about five to seven hundred people . __eou__ Will it be an all day event ? __eou__ Yes .

How is your business on the Internet , Steven ? __eou__ Don't mention it . I lost a bunch of money on it this year . I think it is on the brink of bankruptcy . __eou__ I am sorry to hear that . It shows that you should buy companies , not ideas . __eou__ I changed my strategy around too . I am investing in good companies now . __eou__ Yes , I agree with you . I am going to find a good company and invest in it soon . __eou__ It's a good idea . But please be careful when you invest this time . __eou__ Yes , I will . I should learn more from you .

Let's chat next time . Bye-bye . __eou__ Bye . __eou__
Daniel , you can't spit the gum everywhere . __eou__ Come on , just a little piece . __eou__ Do you know how many people chew gum everyday ? __eou__ I have no idea . __eou__ Just in Beijing , people consume 300,000 pieces of gum every day . __eou__ That's amazing . __eou__ If all the people spit out the gum like you , the whole world would become a big trash can . __eou__ Come on , you are making too big deal out of this . __eou__ I just want to remind you to behave yourself . __eou__ OK , dear sister , I see . This kind of thing will not happen again . __eou__

I think you'll have to do some replies . __eou__ Thank you , Anne . You've done an excellent job . Did they mention the date for the next meeting ? __eou__ No , they didn't . The chairman said he would send a memo to all managers by the end of this week informing them of the date of the next meeting . __eou__

But may I ask what line of business you are in ? __eou__ I'm in the electrical appliances . __eou__ I see . Would you be interested in seeing the audio-visual products ? They are made by our company . __eou__ Thanks , they are rather attractive . But I think there is nothing better than seeing things In actual operation . __eou__ Yes , of course . Would you like to make an inspection tour of some factories ? __eou__ Yes , very much , if it wouldn't add inconvenience to you . First hand information is always more valuable than reading pamphlets . __eou__ I'll make the arrangement and let you know the time tomorrow . __eou__ That would be great . __eou__
Your request for compensation makes me surprised . What happened ? __eou__ It is because of the quality . __eou__ Could you tell me the particulars ? __eou__ I told you that we want first-class goods . So the quality , specification and price are clarified in our contract . Do you remember those details ? __eou__ Yes , I do . __eou__ The re-examination results indicate that one-third of the goods are not up to standard . __eou__ Really ? We began to load the goods after we made sure they were qualified . __eou__ I told you the truth . According to the contract , if you fail to honor the contract , we are entitled to cancel it . __eou__
Can you believe her ? She is not even a hundred pounds and she is going off on how she wants to go on a diet . __eou__ Tell me about it . If I was as small as her , I wouldn't think about going on a diet . __eou__ Me too . But what are we going to do ? I have been on 4 different diets and I can't seem to lose weight . __eou__ That's because you don't exercise . If you were more active , you wouldn't have a dieting problem . __eou__ What do you know ? You are over weight too . __eou__ I'm not on a diet though . __eou__ I know . But I don't have someone to diet with . If we help each other and motivate each other , then I think we can lose some weight . __eou__ I like ice cream too much though . __eou__ C'mon . You'll feel better and look better and as a reward you can eat a little bit of ice cream here and there . __eou__ It does sound appealing . __eou__ It's a great idea . I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier . Going on a diet with a friend to back you up is a great way to succeed . __eou__ Okay . I'm in . Let's do it . __eou__ Great . I'll get our plan started right away . __eou__ Can we start tomorrow though ? __eou__

Good day ! What can we do for you ? __eou__ I'm considering buying a new car , the old one hasn't been running too well recently , and was wondering what kind of credit you can offer me . __eou__ Buying a new car is a big expense ; we understand that , so we have a variety of loans to suit your needs . __eou__ That's great . I'm looking to borrow quite a large sum , though . __eou__ With our Personal Automobile Consumer Loan , the borrower can borrow up to 80 % of the purchase price . __eou__ That's good news . The car I'm interested in is priced at 120,000 RIB , but I think I can get a bit of discount on that . I can afford to put up around 40,000 RIB myself . __eou__ That's great . You will need to make an initial down payment of 20 % , and then we can get going with this . __eou__ The funds are all ready to go in my personal account , so let's transfer it . __eou__

Is the dollar up or down ? __eou__ Today's rate is 823 . 71 RIB to 100 USD . __eou__ To be honest , I have no idea about these things ! But I'm sure that's alright . __eou__ Yes , it's not bad . I will need to see your passport though . __eou__
Welcome to IBA . What can we do for you today ? __eou__ Hello . I'm a Financial Manager in a local company and we'd like to open a Foreign Currency Account with you . __eou__ I see . That shouldn't be a problem , Sir . Which currency would you require ? __eou__ We have recently started doing a lot of business with British companies , so we'd like to open a GAP account . How should we go about this ? __eou__ The first step is to fill in the Account Opening Application and the accompanying Seal Card , stamped with your company's seal .

We value all of our customers , regardless of circumstances . What can we do to help ? __eou__ We are going to need a loan . I'm not sure what loan is suitable for us , though . __eou__ If you think it will be very short-term , I would recommend you go with the 60 - day loan . Then it can be paid back quicker , so you won't have to consider it in the future . __eou__ That seems like a good idea , it's for wages , you see . __eou__
I love your little Lulu dolls.How much for a batch of 6,000 ? __eou__ For a batch of 6,000 we would charge two dollars a doll . your total cost would be $ 12,000 . __eou__ That ’ s a little steep for our company.Do you offer any discounts ? __eou__ Well , we ’ d like to work with you . If you ordered a larger quantity we could drop the price a little .

That still might be a little hard.Couldn ’ t you discount it further ? We ’ Ve been pricing other suppliers , and this discount might __eou__ We do value your business . I think I can offer a further discount – say 5 % ? __eou__ I think we can handle that . Let me confirm with my boss and touch base with you again tomorrow . __eou__

is that your rabbit ? __eou__ yes , I just adopted her from the humane society this weekend . __eou__ that's good of you . why did you decide to get a rabbit . __eou__ well , i wanted to get a pet that wouldn't disturb the neighbors . at the same time , I wanted a pet that would be affectionate . __eou__ rabbits aren't usually that affectionate , are they ? __eou__ if you cuddle them a lot when they are very young , they can be just as affectionate as dogs or cats . __eou__ i didn't know that . Are rabbits difficult to take care of ? __eou__ not really . I went to the veterinarian to get her vaccinated and she told me that all I needed to do was to make sure to trim its nails from time to time , to give her food and water , and to clean its __eou__ that sounds pretty easy . Do rabbits make your house smell ? __eou__ No , rabbits aren't very stinky . As long as your clean the cage on a regular basis , it's not too bad . __eou__ can you train a rabbit to do things ? __eou__ you can't train them like you can train dogs , but you can train them to do some things . For example , you can train them to go the bathroom in a special rabbit toilet . __eou__ that's amazing ! Has she bitten you yet ? __eou__ not yet . She's pretty tame . I think she must be used to being around lots of different people . __eou__
I really think all Americans look alike . __eou__ You ’ re crazy ! You haven ’ t been here long enough . __eou__ But they do . __eou__ What makes you say that ? __eou__ They wear the same clothes , they ’ re all blond , they all drive cars , they all own Parker fountain pens ; they all drink Coca Cola , and they all chew gum . __eou__ I disagree with you . They don ’ t all wear the same clothes ; they ’ re definitely not all blond ; they don ’ t all own Parker fountain pens ; they don ’ t all drink Coca Cola , and they don ’ t all chew gum . I do think they all drive cars though ! But that doesn ’ t have anything to do with how they look ! __eou__ Maybe I am just homesick . I know you ’ re right . I just miss China , that ’ s all . __eou__
Did you check the internet for next week's weather forecast ? __eou__ I sure did . You're in luck ! It's supposed to snow all week in the mountains ! __eou__ Yes ! Somebody up there loves me ! I knew it wasn't too late for snow . __eou__ It is kind of strange though , to have snow in April , and so much of it . __eou__ There have been so many dry winters lately that it's about time , don't you think ? __eou__ When you put it that way , I guess the skies can't hold out on us forever . __eou__ This will be the best ski trip I've ever taken . I can't wait to use my new hoard . __eou__ It will be the best as long as the weatherman is right . __eou__
May I invite you for a dance ? __eou__ With pleasure . __eou__ You dance well . Do you breakdance ? __eou__ Me , what brought that on ? __eou__ There's a story about breakdancing in the paper . __eou__ What does it say ? __eou__ According to the story , it's some sort of modern dance style . __eou__ Like disco ? __eou__ Well , breakdancing is more a physical exercise than a dance . __eou__ And disco a kind of nightclub . __eou__ Right , a disco is a place where people dance according to nonstop recorded music ... __eou__ So ... disco is what the music is called and a disco is a place where people go to dance to it.And breakdancing is a different sort of thing altogether . __eou__ You are witty . __eou__
Let's go over this plan again . __eou__ From Vancouver , we bike along the border all the way to Winnipeg . __eou__ And that is mostly flat , right ? __eou__ Relatively , once we're out of Alberta , anyway . Then it's hills again in Aitoba . __eou__ And from Winnipeg we go around the lakes through Toronto , right ? __eou__ That's right . And up in to Quebec . And that's where we stop . __eou__ It doesn't sound like that much when we go over the plan but that's a long , long ride . __eou__ Are you ready for the cross country of a lifetime ? __eou__
This Olympic park is so big ! __eou__ Yes . Now we are in the Olympic stadium , the center of this park . __eou__ Splendid !

You know , I really don ’ t think Americans are very romantic . __eou__ Where did you get that idea ? __eou__ That ’ s the impression I get from the movies , and from looking around .

But go ahead . __eou__ No , this will help answer your question . In American society boys and girls are raised together . They ’ re not segregated in their activities ! Boys and girls go out together from an early age . __eou__ OK , go on . __eou__ After being raised together , men and women can be business-like in each other ’ s company . It really doesn ’ t have anything to do with the way a man and woman behave toward each other when they are in love . Does that answer your question ? __eou__ Not exactly , but I see your point . __eou__ I think Americans are pretty romantic when they are in a relationship and a lot of flirting goes on in every office . After you ’ Ve been in America for a while , you will probably see what I mean . __eou__

Ok , it works out for my schedule . Thanks a lot ! __eou__ You are welcome ! __eou__
Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work . It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other . __eou__ If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company . __eou__ Beneficial ? I don ’ t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating . __eou__ But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency . __eou__ I doubt that . __eou__
Hello . 9-1- 1 . Can I help you ? __eou__ I need the police . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ My neighbor hit my brother on the head .

It's in mint condition ! __eou__ That's why I can profit from it ! __eou__ You're going to re-sell it on eBay Taiwan ? __eou__ You bet . eBay Taiwan doesn't have it ! And bidding will start at two thousand NT . This baby's worth about six thousand to real tennis fans ... __eou__ I've created a monster ... you're a better bayer than me ! __eou__
Who is it ? __eou__ Supervisor . Open the door . __eou__ Wait a sec . __eou__ What are you doing here ? __eou__ We're watching a football match . What's the matter ? __eou__ Your neighbors complained that you were so noisy that they can't sleep . __eou__ I'm sorry about this . __eou__ Please turn down the TV .

Are you ok , Chuck ? You look pale . __eou__ I'm fine , Katherine . I just stayed up late last night working on my Chinese . __eou__ Oh , poor you . You know what ? I found a new way to learn Chinese and it works very well . __eou__ You did ? Do tell me . I've spent all these months trying to learn something new about it , but I've made little progress ! __eou__ Sure . I'm learning Chinese through songs . __eou__ So you're learning Chinese songs ? __eou__ You can say that . I can actually sing some of them now . __eou__ That's a real achievement . How did you do that ? __eou__ I start by listening to the song a few times and after several times I am able to follow the singer . __eou__ It makes sense . __eou__ It does . I've learned some Chinese folk songs this way . They are clearly presented and easy to follow . __eou__ Can Join you , Katherine ? I do want to have a try . __eou__ Why not ? I downloaded a beautiful song the other day . We can learn it together now . __eou__ Great . Do you think we need a Chinese dictionary ? __eou__ Yes , just in case we run into me new characters . __eou__ Ok . I will bring it with me . __eou__
Will you help me take these things to the car ? __eou__ OK , which car do you want me to put them in ? __eou__ Bring them to my wife's car . __eou__ Which one is hers ? __eou__ The blue SUV in front of the Honda . __eou__ What should I take first ? __eou__ That chair over there , but please be careful with it . It was a gift from my mother-in-law . __eou__ Don't worry , I won't drop it . Wow , it's really heavy . I don't think I can move it by myself . __eou__ Let me help you with that . I don't want you to hurt your back . __eou__ Where are you taking all this stuff ? __eou__ Didn't I tell you ? We're moving to Florida ? __eou__ You're moving now ? I knew you were moving , but I thought you said you were moving next month . __eou__ Yes , that's true , but my wife found a new apartment on the Internet the other day and she wants to move right away . __eou__
This is how a holiday should be . Relaxing on the beach with a nice cool drink . __eou__ Isn ’ t it wonderful here ? The kids are enjoying themselves in the swimming pool . I hope it ’ s safe . __eou__ Don ’ t worry about them . They ’ re very responsible . Besides , there are many people there and there ’ s lifeguard employed by the hotel . Waiter ! Could I have another drink pleas ? Thank you . So , what shall we do this evening ? __eou__ The kids said that they wanted to go to a party at the hotel . There ’ s a special one just for kids . __eou__ So , we could try that restaurant that was recommended in the guidebook . Then we could go to a club . We haven ’ t been to one for ages . __eou__ That ’ s a great idea . We can really enjoy ourselves without worrying about the kids . __eou__ Now , how about going for a swim in the sea ? We shouldn ’ t sunbathe all day . __eou__
Liu , two days later , you will be in England . Don't you feel excited ? __eou__ Yes , of course . I can't wait to be there . __eou__ Have you got everything ready ? __eou__ I think so . I won't forget anything important . As long as I have my passport , VISA card and airline ticket . It will be OK . __eou__ By the way , have you double checked your flight time ? __eou__ More than 100 times . The flight takes off at 12:00 . __eou__
Hi , Francis , morning ! How are you doing today ? __eou__ I had a bad start of the day . I was stuck in a bad traffic jam on my way and I missed my morning meeting . __eou__ Indeed , I agree that is not a good start . How about the meeting ? You missed anything important ? __eou__ It is ok . My boss briefs me later on . __eou__ Was he unhappy with you not attending the meeting ? __eou__ Err , kind of . You know this traffic jam is really bad with so many new cars hitting the streets these days . __eou__
You look great ! __eou__ Thanks to you . I'm totally pumped up . __eou__ So you are happy that you made the decision to join us . __eou__ I surely am . But still there is one single problem . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ I eat more and more these days . And it puts even more weight on me . __eou__ It's not good to start with too much work-out at the beginning . What about trying something else ? __eou__ I'd love to do that . What do you recommend ? __eou__ More and more people are warm up to Yoga these days . Do you want to have a try ? __eou__ Do you think it's a good option for health and relaxation ? __eou__ Absolutely . But it takes great perseverance to master . __eou__ I can so that . __eou__ Here is a free class going on right over there . Go and join them . __eou__ How did it go ? __eou__ Everything was okay when it started , but the music made me drowsy . So I think I may have dozed off for a minute over there . __eou__
What kind of person do you think you are ? __eou__ Well , I am always energetic and enthusiastic . That's my strongest personality . __eou__ What are your strengths and weaknesses ? __eou__ Em , as I have said , I'm diligent and industrious . On the other hand , sometimes I'm too hard-working and I put myself under too much pressure to make things perfect . __eou__ What qualities would you expect of persons working as a team ? __eou__ To work in a team , in my opinion , two characteristics are necessary for a person . That is , the person must be cooperative and aggressive . __eou__ How do you spend your leisure time ? __eou__ I like playing games and having sports . They are my favourite hobbies . __eou__ So , what kind of sport do you like most ? __eou__ Oh , it's hard to narrow it down to just one . I mean , I like all kinds of sports , basketball , swimming , bike riding and so on . Maybe it is just the reason why I am so energetic and vigorous . __eou__
How do I get to the EDD ? __eou__ Actually , you do not need to go into the office to file a claim . You can do it over the phone or the Internet . __eou__ Can I go in to look for a job at their office ? __eou__ That ’ s a good decision . They have many good job search tools there . __eou__ Is there an office near me ? __eou__ The Internet has a list of Employment Development Offices listed online . __eou__ Do you know where the local office for this area is ? __eou__ Our office is over on Green Street , just west of the college . __eou__ If I go there , will I be able to collect money right away ? __eou__ Everyone has a one-week waiting period before they can collect . __eou__

They must be packed in a proper strong box . Your light cardboard box won't do . __eou__ Have you got boxes for sale ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Is it all right this time ? __eou__ Yes . Now fill in two customs declarations and one despatch note in English . You'll have to take your parcel to the next window for examination when you have completed the forms . __eou__ OK . __eou__ Have you written down your return address ? __eou__ Yes , I have . __eou__

Will you quit or not ? __eou__ Yes , ma'am . Whatever you say . __eou__
Home at last . Tonight we have a lot of homework though . __eou__ Are you saying we don ’ t have time to watch our favorite show tonight ? Jane , you know I really don ’ t like our teacher all that much . He gives far too much homework . He criticizes me in front of everyone all the time . __eou__ To tell the truth , I don ’ t really like him either . He ’ s kind of boring and not very active . He always looks unhappy too . __eou__ Yes , and he also ... __eou__ Do you think we should be talking about him like this behind his back ? __eou__ Probably not . After all he is our teacher . We should try to find something nice to say . If you can ’ t say something nice you shouldn ’ t say anything at all . __eou__ I absolutely agree . It ’ s getting dark . We should finish our homework now . __eou__ All right . I want to take a shower first , I ’ m exhausted . __eou__

Where are the other guys ? __eou__ It's a bit disappointing that they are all out for a movie . __eou__ Bad timing . I want to see them so much . How are they ? __eou__ Not bad . I heard you are going to graduate this coming summer , right ? __eou__ Yes , that's why I'm here . I'm thinking about buying a second-hand apartment . __eou__ Did you go to a real estate agent ? __eou__ No , that will be too expensive . __eou__ That's true . By the way , what kind of apartment are you looking for ? __eou__ My first job's salary will be a bit low . So the cheaper the better . Just one I can afford . __eou__ Sure . I'll try my best to find a satisfying one for you . __eou__ I'll appreciate it so much . __eou__
What's in the box ? __eou__ Sandy , I think we made a mistake ... __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ It's a cute little teddy bear ! __eou__ How sweet !

You guys will really have an interesting love story to tell everyone ! __eou__

Good morning , sir . __eou__ Good morning . I'd like a business suit made with this material . __eou__ Do you have a particular style in mind ? __eou__ The kind that never goes out of fashion , I guess . __eou__ I think you should realize that even the most conservative style changes . __eou__ I'm sure you're right . I just dread the idea of making a new suit every year . __eou__ The changes are usually not that dramatic . We just got some pictures of the latest fashion . Would you like to take a look ? __eou__ Good . I think I'll choose this single breasted one . When can I get it ? __eou__ Next Friday . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__

I ’ ll take it . __eou__ Very well , I can ring you up over here , sir . __eou__
What's wrong , Dave ? You look down today . __eou__ I didn't pass the English exam . How to learn English well ? Can you give me some suggestions ? __eou__ Well , English is a " paper tiger " . Its natural enemy is adequate practice . __eou__ I have done a lot of reading comprehension exercises , and I also spend much time in memorizing English words . __eou__ I suggest you read English texts aloud every day , and try to speak more . That will be beneficial to cultivate your sense of the language . __eou__ Really ? I'll have a try . Maybe I will get high marks next time . __eou__
You mustn't touch the wet paint , Bill . __eou__ I'm sorry . I won't do it again . __eou__ Try to be more careful in future . __eou__ I shall . I wasn't as careless as John Sampson . He walked across that wet cement over there . __eou__ The workmen oughtn't to leave it without a no tice . __eou__ The headmaster asked them not to do so . __eou__ Then why isn't there a notice ? __eou__ They went to their stores to get one . Here they come with it now ! __eou__ But look at them ! They've forgotten about the wet cement and they're walking across it to put up the notice ! __eou__
My elder aunt feels like vomiting , she is pregnant . __eou__ She'd better drink plenty of hot water and lie in bed . __eou__ But she feels like having no appetite at all if she stays at home all day . __eou__ Don't worry . She will be all right . __eou__
Hi , Kenji . __eou__ Hi , Debbie . Have a seat . How's it going ? __eou__ I'm OK . How are you doing ? __eou__ Pretty good . Listen ... have you heard about the new Thai restaurant over on University Avenue ? __eou__ Do you mean The Bangkok ? __eou__ That's the one . A bunch of us are going there for dinner tomorrow night.How about coming with us ? __eou__ Sure , I'd love to . __eou__ Great . I'll call and make reservations . __eou__ Any time after 6 o'clock is good for me.Oh ! I'm late ! I have a class . __eou__ All right . I'll call you tonight and tell you the time . __eou__ Great . Talk to you then . __eou__
He thought he could take Jimmy in , but you know , Jimmy is no fool . __eou__ So ? __eou__ So Jimmy just took him in instead and it cost him an arm and a leg . __eou__ You mean finally Henry bought the broken car himself . __eou__ Exactly . Herry is almost broken now . __eou__
How do you celebrate national day in your country ? __eou__ There are parades in many cities and people fly the national flags from almost every public building . __eou__ What kinds of parades are there ? __eou__ The parades are usually military ones , but sometimes there are procession of people carrying flags and singing patriotic songs . What do you do on national day in your country ? __eou__ We don ’ t have a national day . __eou__ Really ? That ’ s unusual . __eou__ I guess it is . Most countries have on , but we don ’ t . __eou__ Actually , even though we have parades , most people just use the national day holiday to visit family or go shopping . In the evening , many people watch special TV shows which celebrate national day . __eou__
Welcome ! Welcome to Little Italy . We're the most Italian family here ! __eou__ So I've heard . That's why I'm having such a great time . __eou__ If I hadn't married an Italian man , I probably wouldn't be pregnant so often . And maybe I could raise pigs instead of bambinos ! __eou__ Huh ? Um ... well , it's nice to see that some people still have big families . __eou__ It is nice , but it would be nicer if my macho husband would get off his tush and help me . Ha-ha ... Have this . It's from Italy ! __eou__

How much did you pay ? __eou__ $ 14,500 . It only has 10,000 miles on it , so it ’ s like a new car . __eou__ Does that mean you ’ re not going to take the train to work anymore ? __eou__ Well , sometimes , I think it ’ ll be nice to drive to work instead . We ’ ll see . Want to go for a ride ? __eou__ Yeah , sure . __eou__ Come on . __eou__

How can you get such a good opportunity to be trained overseas ? __eou__ Actually , it is a policy in my company .

OK , Mr . Wu . You may come in . I'm Anne Smith and on my right , my colleague , Anna Duncan , and on my left , Angela Lamb . Do please sit down . __eou__ Thank you . Good afternoon Mrs . Smith , Miss Duncan , Miss Lamb . __eou__ Your English is fluent . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ How do you think of the weather today ? __eou__ I don't like the weather like this . Cold and rainy . Hope it become sunny as soon as possible . __eou__
How was your date recently ? __eou__ Not too bad . It is seemingly too hard for me to find a place for our date . __eou__ I guess so . Going to watch a movie and having dinner at a restaurant are usual . __eou__ She said she wanted to go Dutch in dating . __eou__ Yes , now many girls want to be independent , so it is a little popular , especially among white collars . __eou__ But I am still traditional , so I felt weird when she paid for herself . __eou__ Forget about it ! __eou__ Are you satisfied with your girlfriend ? __eou__ It will be a long story . We have many differences , for example , she usually puts all her clothes into washing machine . That is the sort of thing I can not bear . __eou__
Hey Jackie . What are you doing ? __eou__ Nothing much . I'm just relaxing today . Why ? What's going on ? __eou__ I was thinking about heading to the mall . Do you want to go ? __eou__ Are they having a sale ? __eou__ Yeah . Both Bon and Nordstrom's is having there annual sale . It's a great time to buy some clothes you've been holding out on . __eou__ That sounds great . Where should we meet ? __eou__ I'll meet you in front of Nordstrom's in 30 minutes . __eou__ Sounds good . See you there . __eou__ What do you think about these shoes ? __eou__ They're cute . But do you think you'll wear them much ? __eou__ No . Not really . __eou__ This sweater is so pretty . I love the low neck design . __eou__ I bet it's expensive . __eou__ It's on sale for $ 80 . What do you think ? Should I try it on ? __eou__ For 80 bucks it looks great . Go try it on . __eou__
Do you know that the dolphin is the most intelligent animal in the world ? __eou__ Yes . Dolphins have a big brain and they are very smart . They are also the fastest swimmers in the world . __eou__ They must be amazing animals . __eou__ They are . I read a story about a dolphin saving a A from drowning in the sea . __eou__ I read that story too . They seem to be able to understand men . __eou__ They sure can . Maybe they can interact with men better than monkeys and apes . __eou__
Has Alan shown up yet ? __eou__ Nope . I guess something might have come up . __eou__ I wonder what happened . __eou__ I don't know . I hope it's nothing serious . __eou__ Last week his sister was admitted to the hospital . __eou__ Oh ? What happened ? __eou__ His sister had a car accident last week . __eou__ Is she fine now ? __eou__ She is still in a coma . __eou__ Oh , poor Alan ! His sister is the only one he has left since his parents died last year . __eou__

I have added your name to the waiting list.We will call you as soon as possible . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
I'll be checking out of the hotel in about 30 minutes . __eou__ Thirty minutes or 30 seconds , sir , it doesn't matter , I'm ready for you . __eou__ Great ! As you know , however , the day in New York has hardly begun . __eou__ There's nothing like getting an early start , sir . __eou__ What can I do with my baggage while I visit a few more tourist spots ? __eou__ You can leave your baggage in our storage space , with a deposit . __eou__ Isn't my baggage enough of a deposit ? __eou__ I wish it was , but it isn't . They will still want a credit card . __eou__ It's always something , isn't it ? Let me think about this for a second . __eou__ Don't forget that you have very little time , sir , before you have to check out . __eou__
Here I raise a question for you . Just imagine we will have a foreign guest from Japan . Can you tell me how I ought to be to the most comfortable and polite ? __eou__ Firstly , we can provide our meeting agenda before he comes . And then on the day when he is coming , we wait for him at the gate of our company's gate . __eou__ Well , that's right . How about on a formal occasion ? What should I say to show my gratitude ? __eou__ It's an honor and a privilege to receive a visit from such a distinguished group . __eou__ And then , what should we do next when you meet the guests ? __eou__ Maybe we should send them to the reserved hotel for a short break , meanwhile we can also raise a question on what they want to have and know . __eou__ That sounds good , Fred ! __eou__
Alan , I believe you have studied our catalogue and price list . Are you interested in some of our products ? __eou__ Yes , I'm thinking of buying some T-shirts , but I find your price is on the high side . __eou__ I'm very surprised to hear you say that . I think our price is very favorable . You can hardly get such an attractive price from other suppliers . __eou__ I'm not so sure of that . I think it's difficult for me to push sales at such a price . __eou__ What's your proposal then ? __eou__ I think to get the business done , you should at least reduce the price by 20 % . __eou__ We could take a cut on the price if your order is a large one , but a 20 % reduction is really more than we can do . What quantity are you going to order from us then ? __eou__ As a trial order , I'll take 5,000 dozen this time . __eou__ 5,000 dozen is by no means a large order . In that case , the best I can do is to give you a 5 % reduction . __eou__ That's really a big change from 20 % . I really can't accept that . __eou__ What's your counter-offer then ? __eou__ To conclude the deal , I'd say a reduction of at least 15 % would help . __eou__ 15 % is impossible . That'll leave us almost no profit . __eou__ If that's the case , I'll have to go somewhere else to meet my needs . __eou__ How about doing it this way ? You increase your quantity to 8,000 dozen and I'll give you a l0 % reduction . __eou__ 8000 would be too large a figure to be used for a trial . __eou__ Well , to encourage future business , I'm prepared to reduce the price by 10 % . We can't go any further . __eou__ Ok . Let's call it a deal . __eou__
Good morning , Sir . Are you here to get some advice about our new Personal Financing Program ? __eou__ I am indeed . What can you tell me ? __eou__ The account is a compound savings account , which is in RIB and Forex . __eou__ Do I get a card ? __eou__ Yes , you can have a Money Link card . You can also base the account on time deposits . The choice is yours . __eou__ How about the interest ? I'm not really happy with the interest I'm receiving through my Current Account . __eou__ The interest on this new account is higher than any of the accounts in our Personal Financing . __eou__ That sounds better . Also , can I use the one card for several accounts ? Say , if I have two or three accounts and want to transfer money from one to the other ? __eou__ Yes , you can have multi-accounts on the card , you can also make transfers from the account and securities companies and various other benefits . __eou__ That's wonderful . __eou__

Where can I add some air to my tires ? __eou__ Right here . I'll do it for you . ( Three minutes later ) Your car's ready . __eou__ Good . How much does it come to ? __eou__ Nine gallons of premium . That's $ 15.32 , please . __eou__
Excuse me . Do you think I can get there in time to catch the 11:30 train ? __eou__ Well , let me see . Now it's 11:00 sharp . It's a long way to go.If I take the shortest route , we may come across a traffic jam.If I take a less heavy route , it will save us 10 or more minutes , but you'll have to pay more . Which do you prefer ? __eou__ Are you sure that I can get there in time if we take the less heavy route ? __eou__ Generally speaking , we can if we go at this speed and nothing unexpected happens . __eou__ How much more do I have to pay ? __eou__ Compared to the shortest route , you may pay around 5 Euro more . __eou__ That's acceptable . No one wants to miss a train . __eou__ OK ... Here we are . We'll turn left at this cross . To go straight ahead is the shortest route . __eou__ Thank you ! __eou__

It's too soon to say really . __eou__ What about your friend Zoe __eou__ She's from Australia . She lives in Sydney .

Hi , I made a reservation for a mid-size vehicle . The name is Jimmy Fox . __eou__ I ’ m sorry , we have no mid-size available at the moment . __eou__ I don ’ t understand , I made a reservation , do you have my reservation ? __eou__ Yes , we do , unfortunately we ran out of cars . __eou__ But the reservation keeps the car here . That ’ s why you have the reservation . __eou__ I know why we have reservations . __eou__ I don ’ t think you do.If you did , I ’ d have a car.See , you know how to take the reservation , you just don ’ t know how to hold the reservation and that ’ s really the most important part of the reservation , the holding . Anybody can just take them . __eou__ But we do have a compact or an SUV if you ’ d like . __eou__ Fine . I ’ ll take the compact . __eou__ Alright . We have a blue Ford Focus for you , Mr . Fox . Would you like insurance ? __eou__ Yeah , you better give me the insurance , because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car . __eou__
The weather is terrible . __eou__ Yeah . It's been raining a lot these days . __eou__ I have been watching a lot of videos at home because of the constant rain . __eou__ Have you heard when it's supposed to get better ? __eou__ I saw the weather report , and it's going to rain for the next eight days . __eou__ That sucks so much . What are we going to do ? __eou__ I'm getting pretty bored . We should do something despite the rain . __eou__ I'm with you . What do you have in mind ? __eou__ I haven't been to the Mall in a long time . Let's go there . __eou__ That sounds good . They have a movie theatre there , so if we get bored , we can watch a movie . __eou__ Great . I'll stop by your place now . __eou__ Ok . Don't forget to bring your umbrella . The rain can start up again anytime . __eou__
At their last meeting , the stockholders voted unanimously to block the merger of our company with Blycore . All the executive committee was in favor of the merger ... I don't understand how the stockholders could have so much power to throw a wrench in the plans ... __eou__ If they all unite on a certain issue , it's the stockholders who have the final say . You'd think it might be our CEO or the workers , but in fact , the stockholders control the money so they have the most power . __eou__ Is it really that simple ? It doesn't seem very efficient to run things that way ... __eou__ It might not be the most efficient , but if you think about it , it makes pretty good sense . The stockholders are our investors . They own the capital in our company , so they should have say about what is done with the company . __eou__ I guess I'd buy that ... __eou__
Well , that's it . 7 appointments in Paris at beginning of next week , and 4 in Frankfurt at the end of the week . __eou__ It's certainly a tight schedule . __eou__ Now it's a question of getting there . I need a flight to Paris on Sunday evening and a hotel in Paris for 3 nights . I have to be in Frankfurt by 11 on Thursday morning . And I will need a hotel for one night . I will head home on Friday . __eou__ At what time ? __eou__ My last appointment is at 3 , so I should be free by 5 at the very latest . I think I could get to the airport by 6 . __eou__ Do you know how far you will be from the airport at 5 ? __eou__ No , not really . __eou__ So you are not sure how long it will take to get there ? __eou__ No , but I am sure it won't take more than an hour . __eou__ Don't forget it's Friday nighty . If Frankfurt's anything like London , everybody will be leaving for the weekend . It will be a rush hour and traffic might be moving very slowly . __eou__ You are a pessimist . __eou__ I am a realist . __eou__
What are the best places to visit here please ? __eou__ It depends If you are interested in the city.you might like to tour it by car I can be your guide , We'll leave the afternoon free.You can do some shopping in the mall if you like . __eou__ Great .

It's more fun , I think . __eou__ Okay . Let's go . __eou__ Well , that was tough . __eou__ But we made it . __eou__ This looks great . When was it built ? __eou__ It was first built about twenty-five hundred years ago . __eou__ That's remarkable . __eou__ There are so many ancient relics in China . __eou__
Madam , I made a close study of the draft contract yesterday evening . I think there are something needs to modify . __eou__ Which terms ? __eou__ First , about the terms of payment . Your draft contract says that payment is to be made by D \ A . This is not our practice . We prefer to have the payment made by L \ C through a negotiating bank in America . __eou__ Good . I will add this to the contract . __eou__ The second thing I would like to point out , that is packaging . It's stipulated in the contract that all the computer parts should be packed in cardboard boxes . But I think the wooden cases are much safer . __eou__ Well , you are right . Is there anything else ? __eou__ As far as the contract stipulations are concerned , there is nothing more . Thank you very much . __eou__ Well , we have agreed on all the major points . __eou__
I've just got a new printer . How often do I need to replace the print heads ? __eou__ Well , under normal conditions each head lasts about 5 000 copies or so . It depends on the user , but about once a month is average . __eou__ So if I don't print out very much , it could last a lot longer ? __eou__ That's right . It could last six months or more . This model's designed for heavy use . Don't worry - you'll get an error message telling you when to change the head . __eou__
I think these patterns are quite good . Can you give me a price indication of these ? __eou__ Of course , it's my pleasure . We'll quote you the lowest price prevailing . __eou__ Thank you very much . If your price is suitable , then we can make further discussion of contract . __eou__ Here is our price list , our terms are cash within three months of date of delivery , if you can pay it within one month . we'll give you a discount of 10 % . __eou__ Very good . How many goods do you have ? __eou__ Can you tell me how many goods you intend to order ? __eou__ We want to order 900 dozen . __eou__ The most we can offer you at present is 600 dozen . __eou__

It only costs me 280 dollars . __eou__
Nowadays fewer and fewer people go to the movie theaters to see films . So I am afraid that the film studios are really getting hard time to survive . __eou__ What you said is true . But the film producers there are more flexible ways to get more audience . For example , to make more movie Ccds , so people will spend money buying them . __eou__ But it is true that cinemas are losing the attraction they used to have in the past . __eou__ Yes . Take myself for example . I seldom go to cinemas , but it doesn't mean I no longer see films ; instead , I see films at home-watching Ccds . __eou__

But have you heard the proverb that if one gets married too hurriedly one may regret it for a long time ? __eou__ Yes . However , I believe that marriage comes by destiny .

What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ My stomach hurts , Doctor . __eou__ Has this been a problem before ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ For how long ? __eou__ I have had it on and off for the past three years .

Our productivity has been down for more than six months now . I'm seriously considering pulling in an outside consultant to diagnose the cause of our problematic areas . I think we'd all benefit from an outsider's perspective . Sometimes we're just too closed to the problems to see the forest for the trees . __eou__ I think that's a good idea . You know I got a golfing buddy that runs a consultant firm . He's an expert in organizational comunication.He does't come cheap , but he's an expert in this field.Maybe he could help get things on track . __eou__ Do you have his card ? What's in his portfolio ? Which firm has he worked for in the past ? __eou__ He's done staff for Microsoft and Boeing . I think he's been involved with Siemens ' training evaluations as well .

Ann , it's terrible ! __eou__ What's up ? __eou__ Look , this is a pimple ! __eou__ Oh , I think it is . __eou__ How come ? __eou__ I think it's because of your bad habits ! __eou__ I have no bad habit . I sleep eight hours a day , never eat spicy food , clean the face twice a day and so on . I have done a lot . __eou__ I know you have done a lot , but you always sleep very late . Sleeping eight hours a day doesn't mean it is healthy . Sleeping after 12 is hurtful to our body , and I think this is your problem . __eou__ I wasn't aware of that ! __eou__ You should do better later . __eou__
Why is there no water coming out when you turn on the faucet ? __eou__ Not even a single drop ? __eou__ Well , it's just drip drip drip . But that's not water . __eou__ I don't know .

Can I borrow your Cds for our school dance ? __eou__ Oh , you don't ask much , do you ? __eou__ I promise I will personally guard every single one and they will come back in perfect condition . __eou__ I'll tell you what . Your class can rent them from me for the night and buy back any damaged ones . __eou__ That sounds fair . That's still cheaper than paying a band to come play for us . __eou__ Not as fun though . A live band is way more exciting ! __eou__ Our class doesn't have enough money . We already checked into it . __eou__ Let me know with your next dance . I know a band that may give you a break for the publicity . __eou__
Good morning , Paul ! __eou__ Hi , good morning , you are so early today . __eou__ Yes , traffic wasn't much today , so I made it to the office earlier . __eou__ I see . How long does it take you to reach the office every day ? __eou__ Well , about an hour or so . __eou__ Wow , that ’ s quite a long journey . Do you drive a car ? __eou__ No . I take public transportation . It's safer . __eou__ You are right ! But I get up a little late . That gives me no other option but to travel by motorcycle . __eou__ Well , both have advantages and disadvantages . __eou__
Oh , my ! It's really hot . I've never seen such scorching weather in my life . __eou__ Tell me about it ! It's like the whole world is broiling . __eou__ Oh , look at the thermometer ! The temperature has hit 98 . __eou__ I hope it's not gonna break into three digits __eou__ But it's already awfully close . __eou__ Well , I just hope it'll level off . __eou__ I guess you can ’ t do anything until after dark then . __eou__ I guess so . What else can we do ? You can ’ t stay in the heat for long . __eou__
I enjoy the folk song and dance show very much . __eou__ I'm glad you appreciate our folk music . But a live performance is much more interesting . __eou__ I can't wait anymore . When does the performance start ? __eou__ The show starts at 7 and is over at around 10 o'clock p . m . __eou__ ( After the show ) It's an excellent musical . The acting was very expressive and the songs and dancing were superb . __eou__ I'm glad you enjoyed it . It's had long run , but the house has always been full . __eou__ What do you think of the leading actors ? __eou__ Personally I liked the main character . He was true to type . __eou__ You are a better judge . I don't know the play well enough . __eou__
Plaza Hotel , good morning . Leo speaking . __eou__ Ah yes , I'd like to book two rooms for myself and my father . Could you tell me the cost of a single room per night ? __eou__ Certainly .

Three nights ? __eou__ That's right . __eou__ Just a minute please . __eou__ Yes , we have rooms available then . You require two single rooms ? __eou__ Yes , thank you . __eou__ Can l have your name please ? __eou__ My name is Mona White . __eou__ And your father's name , Ms White ? __eou__ Jack Webber . __eou__ Could you spell the surname please ? __eou__ Sure .

We'll send them to your room in 20 minutes . __eou__
Has everything been OK with you lately ? __eou__ I haven ’ t been able to get a good night ’ s sleep lately . I ’ m exhausted ! __eou__ Have you been too busy to get enough sleep ? __eou__ I try to go to sleep , but I just can ’ t stay asleep . __eou__ How late do you try to go to sleep ? __eou__ I go to bed when I finish my work . __eou__ Has anything in your day-to-day life been bothering you lately ? __eou__ I am worried about how I am going to pay my tuition . __eou__ You might consider listening to relaxing music as you go to sleep to clear your head . __eou__ Doing something relaxing before I go to sleep sounds like a plan . __eou__
Would you mind answering a few personal questions ? __eou__ Of course not . __eou__ OK . Does your present employer know that you are going to leave ? __eou__ Yes . I gave her my resignation a few days ago . __eou__ Will she let you leave your present job ? __eou__ Yes , I think she will . __eou__ Why do you want to leave your present job ? __eou__ Well , there are several reasons . I don't think my present job is suitable for me . That's the first reason . Secondly , your company has a good reputation . I think it can offer me more challenging opportunities . Last , frankly speaking , I wish to get higher pay . __eou__ I appreciate you frankness . Do you know anything about our company ? __eou__ Yes . It's a Korea company and it was built in Beijing five years ago . __eou__

But baby showers as we know them today were not common until after World Warri . __eou__ In any case , I like baby showers , because they allow friends and family to share the joy and excitement of welcoming a new life into the world . __eou__ So you will come , won't you ? __eou__ Of course . I will prepare a good gift for the new arrival . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__
Two people were robbed last night near the park . __eou__ Again ? The area around the park is too dark at night . There should be more lights there . __eou__ I am afraid of the dark .

It is too dangerous . __eou__ I Know . And you should be more careful , too . __eou__
Julia , I saw two men fighting beside our door this morning . __eou__ I know them . They are the two brothers living next door . __eou__ Brothers ?

I ’ Ve prepared some party games for the children too . __eou__ I ’ Ve brought a tape with lots of children ’ s songs on it . __eou__ Hopefully , that will keep everyone happy . __eou__
My amenities bill says that I owe $ 10 for a movie , but I never ordered one . __eou__ Let's see . It says that you were charged Monday at 9:00 p . m . for the movie ' Titanic . ' __eou__ That's absolutely wrong ! I was out exploring the city Monday night . __eou__ Okay , let me see what I can do for you . __eou__ Thank you . I didn't think it would be this simple . __eou__ I can take the $ 10 off your bill , but I need to charge you $ 2 for the service . __eou__ Are you serious ? I have to pay $ 2 for a movie I never watched ? __eou__ Unfortunately , sir , it's how the computer is programmed . __eou__ This is outrageous ! I'm never coming back to this hotel again ! __eou__ I'm sorry , sir . Perhaps you'd like to write a letter to headquarters . __eou__
Look at this fair . This is my first chance to be involved in the fair . It is so gorgeous and amazing ! __eou__ I felt dizzy when I stare at those shining lights .

Are you an outgoing person , or more reserved ? __eou__ I wouldn't call myself outgoing . I used to be very shy when I was little , and it seems that I get a little more relaxed a-round people year after year , and have more fun in groups . __eou__ Are you more of a follower or a leader ? __eou__ I don't try to get in front of people and lead them , particularly . I'd rather cooperate with everybody else , and get the job done by working together . __eou__ What basic principles do you apply to your life ? __eou__ Not to put off till tomorrow what you can do today . I've found out that time and money get away very easily — you think you have them , and they're gone ! Putting things off just makes it worse later , so even if it's hard at the time , I try to get things done that day and not let them go . __eou__

David , we have been doing business for three years , haven't we ? __eou__ Yes , I'm glad we've had very pleasant cooperation in the previous years . And your achievement for promoting our clothes was great in the three years . __eou__ So , I wish to apply for the sole agency of your product in our local market . If you give us the agency , that will be more substantial for our cooperation . __eou__ To be frank , you are not the only one who applies for an agent for us in your country . I'd like to know some ideas of terms on which you would be willing to operate as our agent . __eou__ As we are a well-established company , we are very familiar with the customers ' needs . Besides , we can make full use of our good connections with the wholesalers and retailers here and develop a good market for your products if appointed as your agent . __eou__ Sounds reasonable . I will tell my boss about you agent application . Another question , what do you think is the minimum annual sales you can guarantee ? __eou__ To be on the safe side , and for garment of all materials , sizes , and styles , I think the amount will be 50,000 pieces a year . __eou__ Well . As our sole agency , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own . __eou__ No , certainly not . __eou__
How can I be sure your products are of superior quality , as you promised ? __eou__ One of the reasons for our good quality products is because of our quality inspection system , which is the best of its kind . __eou__ But a quality inspection system does not mean that each unit will always be up to the standard . __eou__ We have trained analyzers to do quality analysis at the end of each part when we make the product . This means that no mistakes are made . __eou__ Your salesman also told me that each worker is trained to do quality analysis . Can you tell me a little about that ? __eou__ Certainly . We provide quality analysis training as part of the training for all new workers , plus a week of further training every year . __eou__
