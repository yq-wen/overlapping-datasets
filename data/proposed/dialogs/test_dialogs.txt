IBA , how can I help ? __eou__ Ah , yes , hello . I'm calling to get some info about your PIN services . You see , my friend also has an account with you and also enjoys shopping on the Internet . She recommended I sign up for this service too . __eou__ That was a wise decision , if I may say so . Our Personal Internet Banking Service offers online shopping transactions , payment of household bills online , account management ... __eou__ I will probably just use it for online shopping . At the moment , I have to meet the seller in person and pay cash , if it's a local seller . __eou__ This will fix all of that for you . If you use our online payment service , the money will come straight out of your account and go directly into the seller's account , in a secure way . __eou__

I work five days a week . __eou__ Do you enjoy work here ? __eou__ It is hard to say.But I've to start by working as a trainee before I really become an experienced marketing assistant.Sometimes , I am really under great pressure when it gets busy . __eou__ Take it easy . I'm sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant .

So how did I do ? __eou__ Not too good , I'm sorry . __eou__ I lost ? __eou__ It was close.To be honest , you had the lowest price by three cents per hint , but they didn't like your delivery date.Acme promised them almost a full month sooner . __eou__ So the price was good ? __eou__ Yes , they loved the price , the delivery date was the problem . They just didn't want to cut the delivery date that close.If something went wrong and you didn't deliver , we might not be able to get stock in time for Christmas.If you could have been two or three weeks faster on delivery , they might have gone with you . __eou__ So I didn't miss by much then . __eou__ No.It was very close and they argued over the bid for a long time . Better luck next time . __eou__ I knew the delivery was slow but I figured the price would win it for me . __eou__ That's possible , Bill.But the price would have to have been a lot lower , like around fifty cents per unit . __eou__

How often do you use the internet ? __eou__ I use it almost every day , but I usually only use it to check my email . I don ’ t often surf the net . You use the internet a lot , don ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes . I use it to find products and components at the lowest price for my company . It can be frustrating when the connection is poor . __eou__ So , you ’ re online eight hours a day . __eou__ Yes , I like the job though . Sometimes , I help other people in the office if they ’ re having trouble online . __eou__ How useful do you think the internet is as a source of information ? __eou__ I think it ’ s fairly useful , but there are two big problems . First , a lot of the information you find online is false . Second , when you buy something online , you don ’ t see it until you actually get it . __eou__ How do you solve the website problems when you ’ re buying something online ? __eou__ What I do is find the website of shops . Then someone from our company visits the shop and buys when they ’ re seen that the products are genuine and suitable . __eou__

He wouldn't tell me anything without a signed contract . __eou__ Well , no surprise there . __eou__ No ! Not at all . But I did find out they have more than one position with different clients , so at least one would probably work out . __eou__ Great , so are you going to sign a contract with them ? __eou__ I ’ m going there tomorrow . __eou__ Great ! Good luck . __eou__ And I think I'll look in on a few other Employment Agencies while I ’ m downtown , to see what they have . __eou__ Good idea . The more people you ask , the better your chances are . __eou__

Television is undoubtedly a great invention , but one of the main criticisms of it is that people just aren't selective enough . Lesley , got a television . how do you pick out the sorts ofprogrammes you want to watch ? __eou__ I try and look at the programmes that are on to decide which particular ones interest me , rather than you turning it on a seven o'clock and you leaving it on until half-past eleven when the programmes finish . __eou__ Do you think of television though as a great time-waster ? __eou__ Un ... I think it can be a time-waster and it depends on how particular people are about what they want to see ... Mm , it can just be a sort total amusement for someone and totally consuming without reallyconsidering what it is they're watching . __eou__ Aha , but how do you prevent it coming into your life and taking oversour evenings and at the same time perhaps get . . . get out of thetelevision some of the sort of best things ... best programmes that ... that undoubtedly are on television ? __eou__ Well , I suppose one of the problems is ... will depend on what a person's life style is , and that if he has other outside interests which are equally important to him as television , he will then , you know , hmm . be more careful about which programme she wants to watch because he has time which he wants to use for other things . __eou__ Do you think though that ... that in . . . in a sense television skilled people's own er ... sort of , creativity or their ability entertain themselves because if they're bored all they do is justturn on the television ? __eou__ Yes , I think that is a danger , and I think that . . in fact is what mishappening to a lot of people who use it as their ... their main ... um field of amusement and ... because they don't have other outside interests and even when people come round they'll leave the television and not be , you know , particularly interested in talking to them , you Know the television will be the main thing in the room . __eou__

It says that I can get rich quickly while working at home ! __eou__ Do you also believe in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I mean that you're gullible . You shouldn't believe everything you read , especially on the Internet . __eou__ But it seems like a good idea . All I have to do is first send some money to the person who sent me the letter . After that he'll tell me how to earn much more money . __eou__ Sounds like a pyramid scheme . Have you heard of those before ? __eou__ Pyramid scheme ? What is that ? __eou__ It's a scam 7 that's based on a hierarchy , like a pyramid . The person at the top asks the people below him for money , and then tells them to go and ask other people for money while sending some of it back to him . __eou__ Sounds good to me . The guy at the top gets money and so do the people below him . __eou__ Not exactly . The scam keeps on going , with the people at the bottom paying more and more money until they reach the very bottom . __eou__ What happens then ? __eou__ Nothing . The people at the bottom give their money to the people above them , and they get nothing . They end up losing . That's why it's a scam . __eou__ I see . I guess I should be more careful about what I read , especially on the Internet where you have no idea who anybody is . __eou__

Last weekend I didn't want to go out either , so I stayed at home and played video games by myself .

I'll see you at 11:30 am . __eou__
The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here ! __eou__ Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up . __eou__ That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying ! __eou__ Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded . __eou__ I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day !

Hello . Can I talk to David ? __eou__ One second , please . ( a few seconds later , the receiver comes back and says ) Hello ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I ’ m sorry .

Good morning . I ’ d like to ask some questions about your insurance policies . __eou__ Of course . Please sit down . How can I help you ? __eou__ I bought a house recently and would like to insure it and its content . __eou__ I see . Here ’ s a pamphlet about our home insurance policy . We ’ Ve named our policy ” umbrella ” . May I ask how much you paid for your home and where you live ? These are the two main thing that decide how much your premiums are . __eou__ I understand . I live in the Oakfield area and paid $ 100,000 for my home . __eou__ Let me just check that on my computer . Oakfield is a low risk area , so your premiums will probably be around $ 100 a month . The other thing to take into account is deductibles . __eou__ In this pamphlet it says that the minimum amount for deductibles is $ 2000 . what does that mean exactly ? __eou__ It means That the first $ 2000 of any claim you make must be paid by you . The insurance policy covers any amount above that , up to the agreed limit . __eou__ Oh , I see . That ’ s fine . What is the advantage of having higher deductibles ? __eou__ If you have higher deductibles , your premium are lower , because you will pay more of the claim and we will pay less . __eou__ It seems that I should do some calculations before deciding . I presume that the insurance period can be for as long as we agree . __eou__ We initially sign one-year policies with our policyholders . These are renewable after the first year . __eou__ If I have a claim , how long does it take to make a settlement ? I ’ Ve heard that with some insurance companies , it can take months . __eou__ That is of great concern to out clients . We aim to satisfy all claims within a month , but we can ’ t guarantee that __eou__
What do you think of the speech the man delivered just now ? __eou__ Don't believe him.He ' s a liar . __eou__ We cannot expect politics to be true anyway . __eou__

That ’ s something unusual . __eou__
When I was at school , I was quite good at track and field events . I was on the school team for the long jump , 100 and 200 meter sprints and the javelin . __eou__ Really ? I was quite good at the hurdles and the discus . __eou__ I wish that I were good at the discus , but I could rarely throw it in the right direction ! I was awful . With the hurdles , I could never jump over them ! __eou__ I thought you were good at the high jump ! __eou__ No , I was good at the long jump . I liked the sprints best . __eou__ Did you ever win any competitions ? __eou__ I was regional champion for the 100 and 200 meters . I usually did well in the dong jump competitions , but I couldn ’ t compete with kids from other schools in the javelin . How about you ? __eou__ I came second and third a few times in the regional championships , but I never won . Did you ever take part in the national championship for the sprinting events ? __eou__ Yes , I did , but I didn ’ t do very well . I made the final in both events , but came last . At least I made the final . I was very pleased with that . __eou__

So get out there , Tiger ! __eou__ Was she really ? So you're telling me there's a chance ? __eou__ Can't hurt to try . Carpe diem . Who can say if we'll be here tomorrow or not ? __eou__

They will be ready in a few minutes . __eou__ Great ! I ’ ll just sit here and wait . __eou__

Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ? __eou__ I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ’ s better to get to know it . What about you ? __eou__ I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays . __eou__ Oh , my God ! John , I didn ’ t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory . __eou__ Come on , Han Maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion . __eou__ But I ’ m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ? __eou__ Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world . __eou__ I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ’ t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ? __eou__ That ’ s a little complicated . You ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ’ s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England . __eou__ Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ? __eou__ Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans . __eou__ How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ? __eou__ That ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries . __eou__ So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ? __eou__ Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College . __eou__ Why did they want to found a college ? __eou__ Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__ Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name . __eou__ When did it begin to be called Harvard University ? __eou__ In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman . __eou__ It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion . __eou__ Therefore , it ’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard . __eou__ Wow , I didn ’ t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history . __eou__ Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S . __eou__ I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard . __eou__ Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related . __eou__ That ’ s right . I have a lot to learn from you . __eou__ You can ask me any question at any time . __eou__
Excuse me , do you know where the visa office is ? __eou__ Yes , I do .

I have an interview with the visa official today . __eou__ I see . Is it your first interview ? __eou__ No , I've already been to here for three interviews . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ I was denied a visa ? __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Like most students . I want to work in America after graduation . __eou__ I see . Well , good luck ! __eou__

I'll see how to goes . __eou__

You know I do need the scholarship . __eou__ I'm afraid I can't I advise you to try again next year . __eou__ Thank you . I will . __eou__
It ’ s a beautiful day here in New Zealand at the Men ’ s Volleyball world championship . My name is Rick Fields and I ’ m joined by the man with the plan , Bob Copeland . __eou__ Thank you , Rick . We ’ Ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams , Brazil and China , face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round . Without a doubt , both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match . __eou__ The ref signals the start of the game and here we go . Ribero serves and China quickly receives the ball . Chen bumps it to the setter , and ... a very nice set by Chen ! __eou__ Xu spikes it ! Wow , what a great hit ! The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in ! __eou__ It ’ s China ’ s service now . What a superb jump serve by Li , oh , and we have a let serve . The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net . __eou__ Brazil calls for a time out and we ’ ll be right back , after a short commercial break . __eou__
Hello . Can I help you , ma'am ? __eou__ Yes . Could you tell me how to send some money to someone with an account with a bank in Germany ? __eou__ Well , you can pay by mail , telegraphic or SWIFT transfer . Or you can have a banker's draft and mail it yourself to the beneficiary . __eou__ Which is the best way ? __eou__ It depends on the amount and how fast you want that person to receive the money . A SWIFT transfer is the fastest method but a banker's draft is usually the cheapest . How much do you wanna send ? __eou__ $ 800 . __eou__ Why don't you send it by mail payment order ? __eou__ How long does it take ? __eou__ About a week . __eou__ I don't know . Can I send it more quickly ? __eou__ Sure . You can have a Telegraphic or a SWIFT transfer . __eou__ And how long do those take ? __eou__ Both a Telegraphic Transfer and a SWIFT transfer will normally be credited to the payee's account within three or four working days , depending on whether the beneficiary's bank is among our correspondent banks or we have to route the transfer through a third bank . __eou__ I see . How can I pay by Telegraphic Transfer ? __eou__ You have to fill out this form , ma'am . __eou__

I am very interested in a new apartment near the Taxing Plaza , but the price is very high , I really can't afford it . __eou__ How much is it for each square meter ? How large is the apartment ? __eou__ It's 7500 yuan per square meter , and I really like the one with three bedrooms and a large living room . Its total area is about 80 square meters . __eou__ That surely will cost you a lot of money . Are you going to make a full payment ? __eou__ Do you think I am rich enough to make it ? I am thinking about buying the apartment by installments . The real estate agency says if I pay a 25 % down payment , I can move in at once . __eou__ If sounds so tempting . Why not go applying for a loan from the bank ? They charge very low interest , so you can choose whether to pay up the balance in 10 or 20 years . __eou__

Look , here is a very special business card from an illustrator . Every time I go through my book of business cards , I will notice it . It is an eye-catching one . __eou__ Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal . __eou__ Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations . __eou__ I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ’ t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ’ ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow . __eou__

I swim just for fun . __eou__ That's good . __eou__

I'm proud of you ! __eou__ Thank you , mom . I love you so much ! __eou__
Now that you have learned Kung fu for a few months , what are your general impression of it ? __eou__ I think , maybe , it takes a real Kung fu master to give a more fair assessment ; meanwhile , I am no more than a beginner . But I really doubt whether kung fu would be of any great help when it comes to defending oneself in real life . __eou__ You mean , kung fu may not be so powerful as it is imagined ? To some extent your idea holds water . Kung fu was originally intended for self-defense , but with time it became something more than defense skills . Now we are apt to treat it as an art . __eou__ An art ! You have a good point there . So it is called martial arts in English . The Chinese are really capable of doing things nicely . They even made fighting a great enjoyment , so marvelous and fascinating . __eou__ Thanks for your compliment ! Perhaps the Chinese culture as a whole has a special inclination towards aesthetics . Do you know Jin Yong ? __eou__ I know he is a martial arts fiction writer . But I've read none of his novels . __eou__ All of his works have been translated into English . I recommend you to read one or two works of his . You'll get a general glimpse into Chinese kung fu culture . When you go through the pages , you are likely to feel they are not about kung fu alone , but cover all walks of life . __eou__ I see . They must have incorporated a series of Chinese cultural elements . __eou__ Yes , take philosophy , for instance . What makes a true , respectable da via , or a warrior hero ? It's not enough only to be formidable . It also involves a man's character , sense of justice , and values of life . __eou__ So kung fu is also a means of self-cultivation , isn't it ? __eou__ Indeed , you're exactly right ! __eou__
Julia , what do you think of the network ? __eou__ Network is omnipresent nowadays . It's quite convenient for people . You see , we can download music and information from the Internet ; I can study from it , too . And the most of all , we can compose , send , and receive e-mails . __eou__ Yeah , you are right . Internet makes our lives easier . But it's a two-blade sword . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I mean Internet brings benefit a lot , but also some disadvantages . For example , many youngsters are addicted to the games and they neglect their study ; or some bad guys steal people's money online , etc . __eou__ I agree . But I think although it has some negative effects , on the whole Internet does more good to us than harm . __eou__ Yeah , you are right . But we have to know how to make good use of it . __eou__
I really want to switch things up . __eou__ What were you thinking ? __eou__ I think I want to try a new style . __eou__ What would you like me to do ? __eou__ I want you to cut my hair shorter . __eou__ How short ? __eou__ I want my hair to be only a few inches long . __eou__ Do you really want it that short ? __eou__ Yes , I've been wanting it short for a while now . __eou__ If you really want me to , then I'll do it . __eou__ I'm absolutely sure that this is what I want . __eou__ Let's do it . __eou__
What is the proper way to sit at a dinner table ? __eou__ Ideal posture is to sit straight , but not stiff , against the back of the chair . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Hands , when one is not actually eating , may be in the lap . Tipping one's chair is unforgivable . __eou__
Good afternoon , sir . You are really a regular customer here . May I ask you why you come here so often ? __eou__ I'm a newspaper columnist . I write comments for a living . I enjoy working in a coffeehouse . __eou__ I see . But isn't it a bit too noisy ? __eou__ I don't mind . By contrast , I quite like the circumstances , as I can see a variety of people here , who can always give me tremendous inspiration . And the most important thing is coffee as it is my life . __eou__ I can see that . Then what is your favorite coffee ? __eou__ Irish coffee is my favorite . But I can drink any other . I'm not particular on it . __eou__ All right . Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home ? __eou__ Not very often . Making coffee is a bit troublesome . Most of the time , I just buy takeout at Starbucks . And also , I quite like instant coffee . __eou__ I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular . Though its taste is not perfect , it's really cheap and convenient . __eou__ Exactly . Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee . People love it all over the world ? __eou__ Which country makes the best coffee in the world ? __eou__ Many people think Brazil makes the best coffee . Brazil exports a lot of coffee . But I love Irish coffee . So it's hard to say . Just depends on your taste . __eou__ I agree . I heard in the western countries , almost everyone likes coffee . Is that true ? __eou__ Yes . No doubt about that . For us , coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink . I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee . __eou__ No , we don't , especially the old people . But more and more young people fall for coffee . __eou__ I suppose so . That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffeehouses in China now . __eou__
My mom is three years older than my dad , and they are like night and day.My mom is 5 footsweet and very nice , and very caring , and very cute , everybody tells her how young she looks , and how she resembles my sister , perhaps.My father is very much completely opposite that.He is a very bi 4 , on a good day , 5 foot 2 , I think in real life , and she is very nice . __eou__ When is the last time you talked to you parents ? __eou__ I talked to them probably about two weeks ago . Yeah , everything is going well . __eou__ Are you going to see them soon ? __eou__ I am going to go home after the holidays and we're going to have a Christmas kind of in January or February . Yeah , depending on when my brother can come in . __eou__ OK . And who are you more like , your mother or your father ? __eou__ I think I have traits of both , actually . I look more like my mother . __eou__

Our new production control program's going live on Monday . The old and the new programs will operate in tandem for four to six weeks . That should give us time to iron out any little problems . __eou__ Hope it all goes well .

We usually go for the irrevocable one , it's the most popular . __eou__ So , I should choose that one ? __eou__ I would recommend it , yes . Then you just need to complete that form . __eou__ I see . It's very nice of you to help me . Is this form alright ? __eou__ Yes , that's all in order . Let's get this processed for you , then . __eou__

I've also been buying organic fruit and vegetables , which is more expensive , but much better for you because they don't have any pesticides on them . __eou__ You've really turned into a health nut , haven't you ? __eou__ I guess you could say that .

You want to go get a facial with me today ? __eou__ Dude , what are you talking about ? Only girls do that . __eou__ Not at all , guys also get facials , manicures and pedicures . There is nothing wrong with looking after your skin and looking good . __eou__ True . So what do they do to you at your beauty spa ? __eou__ Well , first they exfoliate my face , getting rid of all the dead skin . Then I get a face mask with nutrients that keep my skin healthy and young . Afterwards , they apply some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a million bucks . __eou__ That doesn't really sound like something I would be interested in . In any case , I just wash my face every night and use sunscreen during the day . __eou__ Well you should come with me one day , I'm sure you'll love it . __eou__ Uh ... no . __eou__

Some people pile on their agonise and try to seek other ’ s sympathy by telling them how miserable they are . __eou__ Yeah . They take the advantage of other people's hospitality and generosity . __eou__ I was fooled once . A lady told me she needed some money to keep the pot boiling .

You should have seen through her . __eou__ Nothing rang a bell . __eou__
what kind of music do you like listening to ? __eou__ I like music that has a fast beat and is lively , like dance music . You know , I go to a disco almost every week .

I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work . __eou__ I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music . It ’ s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music . __eou__ classical music is supposed to be good for you brain . Research suggest that it makes your brain more active . Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better . __eou__ really ? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often . I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress . __eou__ yes . That ’ s why I listen to it in the evenings . I usually play it as background music while I ’ m cooking or doing other housework . __eou__ I ’ Ve got a few classical music CD ’ s . I should follow your lead and increase my brain power . __eou__ you can find plenty of recording on the internet too . You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . You should do the same with some music . You might find something you like . Classical music might make you clever , but dance might make you livelier and happier . __eou__ that ’ s true . There ’ s clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people . Music can influence a person ’ s feeling and character . __eou__
hi , betty ! __eou__ hi , Andy , how are you finding your new job ? __eou__ pretty good . My colleagues seem alright . So far everything is great . __eou__ that's nice .

Before , when I was assigned a task , I was totally on my own but here most of the work is don __eou__ that ' s really good . It's very important to feel like you are part of the team at work . __eou__ indeed . Team work is highly valued in this new company . I like our boss too . He is easy to get along with treats everybody with respect and appreciation . He's highly respected by all his employees . __eou__ that's great , that's good for a positive work environment and helps motivate employees . I wish my boss was like that . __eou__ true , take my former supervisor as an example . He was extremely controlling and overbearing . He always had to micromanage everything . __eou__ well , now you don't have to worry about that . This new place sounds really good . __eou__ yeah it is . __eou__
So the company decided to cancel your trip to Hong Kong ? __eou__ Yes , The SARS epidemic is not under effective control yet . So I'd better not risk it . __eou__ Maybe it's a good things . If you don't have to go to Hong Kong , you can take a break and take things easy for a while . __eou__ You are right . Maybe we should work out a fitness plan and start to do more exercise . Sitting around in the office all day is no way of keeping fit . __eou__ That's a good idea . Let's see if we can get more people in this plan . There isn't much business these days anyway , so I think many people will be interested . __eou__
Hide me , Yi-jun ! The kids all think I'm the real Easter bunny ! __eou__ Aw , that's sweet ! I knew your costume would be a success . __eou__ It's a success all right .

I never understand why these shops have so much liquor . __eou__ What do you mean ? It's because it's much cheaper to buy liquor duty-free . __eou__ But why ? Why don't people like to buy shirts duty-free ? Or shoes ? I just don't understand why it's always liquor . __eou__ Well , it's because in most countries liquor has a higher tax on it . __eou__ You mean liquor has a higher tax than other things ? __eou__ Yes , of course . Didn't you know that ? __eou__ No , I didn't . How high is the tax ? __eou__ Well , it is different in different countries.But it's because of the high tax that buying liquor duty-free is such a good deal . __eou__ Why would the government want to tax liquor so much ? __eou__ Liquor is considered a luxury item.And also , it is considered as something that isn't very healthy.So if people want to buy it , the government thinks it has the right to tax it . __eou__ That's why a lot of people buy cigarettes here too , isn't it ? __eou__ Of course . Cigarettes are also taxed very heavily . __eou__
I'd like to taste some local dishes . What would you recommend ? __eou__ That's fine . You must try this dish . __eou__ Could you tell me how this thing is cooked ? __eou__ It's fish steamed and served with our special sauce . __eou__ Is it good ? __eou__ Sure . It's a most popular dish . __eou__ I think I'll try it , and give me some green salad together . __eou__ We have two dressings for salad . Which one would you like ? __eou__ What kind do you have ? __eou__ We have French and Thousand Island . __eou__ Make it Thousand Island . __eou__

I told Jennifer she had to drop me off before ten , but she wouldn ’ t leave the party ! __eou__ I don ’ t care ! You are grounded for life , mister ! __eou__ Mom ! That is so unfair ! __eou__ You know the rules and you broke them . No allowance and no TV for a week . I usually never ground you but this time I have to put my foot down ! __eou__ What ! For being a couple of hours late ? You have to be kidding ! __eou__ I don ’ t want to hear it ! Now go to your room ! __eou__
We've got very good workshop facilities here . We do all our own servicing and most repairs . We have separate areas for welding , grinding and sawing . __eou__ Is there anything you don't do in-house ? __eou__ Yes . If we don't have the facilities to deal with it here , we send it out for maintenance . __eou__ Is that more expensive ? __eou__ It depends on the job . It's actually more cost-effective than buying specialist equipment that we don't use very often . __eou__
That's brilliant ! We can name the grades of motor oil by where they come from . __eou__ Mr . Mechanic , I'd like a nice Venezuelan blend this morning . __eou__ I think the Saudi Arabian will hit the spot today . __eou__ But really , maybe this can work .

Do you want to go out to celebrate my good news ? __eou__ sure , where would you like to go ? __eou__ perhaps we could go to the library festival that's going on at the local bookshop . __eou__
What are you working on ? __eou__ I'm figuring out my budget . __eou__ What budget ? __eou__ I'm making a shopping budget , so that I don't spend too much money . __eou__ How much money can you spend ? __eou__ I can only spend $ 300 a month . __eou__ Why only $ 300 ? __eou__ I need to save the rest . __eou__ For what ? __eou__ I need to pay my bills . __eou__ Your budget is a good idea . __eou__ I know .

Would my bank do ? __eou__ Certainly . A simple letter from your bank would be quite satisfactory . __eou__

The ghosts were scary . __eou__ I like scary movies . __eou__ That's Gucci's influence . I love science fiction movies ! __eou__ Of course you do .

Good morning , Jason . How did you sleep ? __eou__ Pretty well , thanks . Still feeling the effects of jet lag a bit , but last night I got at lease six hours of rest . __eou__ Great ! So , are you ready for a full day of shopping ? __eou__ Yep . Let's do it . I'm pretty excited ! __eou__ I know a place that should be perfect . It's called the China Friendship Shopping Center and it's pretty much like an American mall - except with more variety . You can even buy a live chicken there if you want . __eou__ Live chicken ? Thanks , but no thanks . So ... tell me about bargaining . How can I do it like a local ? __eou__ Well . I'll be honest and say you'll never be as good at bargaining as a local person . You're a foreigner and the sellers can see that . But ... if you're smart , you can get bargains that are not too far away from the local price . __eou__ Cool ! Teach me ! __eou__ For starters , you want to do a lot of scouting first . You've got to know what things cost . __eou__ Someone told me to go to a convenience store and see how much a soft drink or a tube of toothpaste costs . The idea is that by comparing the prices of those items , you can figure out the relative prices of everything else . __eou__ That could be helpful . But when you go into a shopping center ... prices become very flexible . You have to be able to read the market . __eou__
So , where can I start my work ? __eou__ Well , your job is to compile and analyze financial information to prepare entries to accounts .

Do you want to order some pizza ? __eou__
Let's have lunch together today . __eou__ It's a good idea . __eou__ I want a Hamburger and ice cream . What about you ? __eou__ I don't like Hamburgers . They have no taste . __eou__ What about cheese cake or apple pie ? __eou__ Maybe I want an apple pie . __eou__
You seem depressed these days . What's the matter ? __eou__ I went bankrupt and I'm flat broke now . __eou__ If I can do anything for you , don't hesitate to let me know . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Come on , you are left behind ! __eou__ Wow , I can't catch my breath . You are running too fast , honey . __eou__ You just need more exercise . __eou__ Yes , but you need to slow down . This is jogging , not racing ! __eou__ I don't care . I want to burn up my fat . __eou__ But running so fast is not good for people over forties . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ We are not as athletic as we were when young . Mild exercise is more suitable for us . __eou__ But I want to burn up more calories ! __eou__ In fact , in order to burn up your fat , you must take it slowly for a longer time . __eou__ Really ? I will slow down then . __eou__
Sorry . I didn't mean to be late . Can I come in ? __eou__ What's your excuse this time ? __eou__ Have I used the one that my sister is sick ? __eou__ Yes , twice last week . __eou__ Are you sure ? I thought I said it was my mother . __eou__ I don't think so . But it could've been . __eou__ Well . You can trust me this time . My sister is definitely sick . I'm just coming from the hospital . They say she might even die . __eou__ I don't buy your story . Try not to have any more sick relatives this week , all right ? __eou__ I'll do my best . __eou__ Just try to be a little more punctual in the future . __eou__ I'm working on it . Really ! __eou__
Can you help me please ? __eou__ Certainly sir . __eou__ Do you know if there is Japanese restaurant near the hotel ? __eou__ Actually there ’ s one on the same street as this hotel . __eou__ Is it far ? __eou__ Not at all . Turn left out of the hotel and it's about a five minute walk . __eou__
Congratulations ! You've just won a car ! __eou__ It's too good to be true . __eou__
I just got a letter from an old high school buddy . __eou__ Really ?

Brian and Christina were mentioning that maybe it would be fun to go on vacation together this year , John . __eou__ I thought that I already told you that I am going with Mark to Alaska . __eou__ Are you kidding me ? __eou__ You know what ? You and I had no plans , so I made plans with Mark . What's the problem ? __eou__ We have been together for a year and usually , people who've been together a year , take their vacation together . __eou__ I don't think that I ever heard of that rule before . Any more rules that you would like to tell me about ? __eou__ Go on your vacation with Mark and when you come back , why don't you just move in with him as well ! __eou__ I am really looking forward to getting away from you . Far away from you ! __eou__
What do you think of Frank ? __eou__ He is all right . But I think he seems to have no back bone . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ Whatever things get tough , he gives in . __eou__
are you looking for a course ? __eou__ yes , but I'm not sure which one to sign up for . __eou__ what kind of program are you looking for ? Full-time or part-time ? __eou__ I have to work during the day , so I want to find a part-time course that I can do in the evenings . __eou__ what kind of course are you looking for ? __eou__ I need to improve my English . __eou__ do you want a one-to-one private tutor or a group class ? __eou__ I think a one-to-one course will be too expensive for me , so a group class would be fine . __eou__ have you ever considered taking one of our online courses ? __eou__ I think I prefer face-to-face instruction better . __eou__ that's fine . If you want , you can sign up for a pre-sessional interview . __eou__ what's that for ? __eou__ one of our qualified teachers will interview you so that they can find a class that suits you best . __eou__ do you have a brochure about the course that I can take home to read ? __eou__ sure . Here's a brochure about out English classes that meet in the evenings . __eou__ thanks . I'll read through it tonight and get back to you tomorrow to sign up for a course . __eou__

It seems to be clearing up . __eou__ It's such a nice change . __eou__ I really don't think this weather will last . __eou__ Let's just hope it doesn't get cold again . __eou__

Please sit down . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ From reading over your resume , I assume your English is quite good . Have you had any experience in the writing field ? __eou__ No , I haven ’ t had any professional experience , but I have always been interested in creative writing . __eou__ Have you ever had a foreign instructor in English composition ? __eou__ Yes , my college teacher was an Australian . She was also our adviser on our English language newspaper . I was the editor for two years . __eou__ That ’ s very interesting .

I wrote the editorial each time . __eou__ What is your aim in going into the field of journalism ? __eou__ To be frank with you , I would like nothing better than to be an overseas reporter some day . __eou__ That can be a rough job , you know . __eou__ Yes , I know that . But I like adventure and excitement in my writing . __eou__ Well , working in an editorial office may not be exciting enough for you . What do you think ? __eou__ I would be glad to do routine work sometimes , if I could be assured of making advancements in the future . __eou__ I think this type of position would be a very good start for you . I am quite sure we can work something out for you , but I cannot give you a definite answer today . We will let you know within just a few days . __eou__ Fine . Thank you very much . __eou__
Hi , my name is Pete . You are Ann . Isn't that right ? __eou__ Hi Pete , how do you know my name ? __eou__ Do you see that girl in the red top ? She told me who you were . __eou__ Oh Andrea , the Spanish girl ? __eou__ Yes , that's her . __eou__ I met her last week at a party . Anyway , you must be from the United States ? __eou__ Actually I live in London , but my family lives in Seattle . __eou__ Oh , I am from London as well . __eou__ Where in London do you live ? __eou__ In Wimbledon - quite close to the tennis courts actually . Which is very nice because I love tennis . __eou__ I play tennis there every week . Shall we have a game one day ? __eou__ That would be lovely . But now let's go and get a drink . __eou__
Sir , may I please see your license and registration ? Do you know how fast you were going ? __eou__ No , I ’ m not sure . I think about 65 mph , right ? __eou__ You ’ re not sure ? You were going at 90 miles per hour ! That ’ s 25 mph over the legal speed limit ! Have you been drinking ? __eou__ No , Officer , not at all . __eou__ Then how can you explain your behavior ? __eou__ Well , I guess I just wasn ’ t paying attention to the speedometer . __eou__ Not paying attention to the speedometer ? Why not ? __eou__ Um , because I was busy talking to my friend . __eou__ On a cell phone ? __eou__ Yes , I was using a cell phone . I just bought it , so I decided to give my friend a phone call to tell him about it . While I did that I also turned on the radio and was listening to one of my favorite songs , and eating some food I had bought at a fast food restaurant , and , um ... guess I had too many distractions . __eou__ That ’ s definitely true . I ’ m going to have to give you a ticket . Please remember to drive more carefully next time . __eou__
I was wondering how you are going to calculate our final grades . __eou__ Grades are based on many things __eou__ What counts the most ? __eou__ Actually I look at all of it and let's not forget class participation . __eou__ Do you grade on a curve or use percentages ? __eou__ Homework , attendance , and quizzes are sixty percent ; the mid-term and final are worth twenty percent each . __eou__ What if we miss something ? __eou__ I will allow one unexcused absence ; after that you need to contact me ahead of time . __eou__ Will you tell us if we are failing during the year ? __eou__ You will be able to track your progress during the year . __eou__
Now , what seems to be the trouble ? __eou__ It's nothing serious . But I always have a headache , and I haven't slept properly for several weeks .

Now , let me listen to your pulse . Mm , do you feel weak ? __eou__ Yes , I never seem to have any energy . __eou__ I'll give you a blood test . Would you roll up your sleeve ? Just as I thought . You're anemic . You'd better pay more attention to your diet . Eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and food high in protein . And don't stay up late working . Try to get more rest . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
How smart of you to book the tickets before hand ! __eou__ Oh , do you really think so ? __eou__ Of course , otherwise you ’ ll just have to wait for hours . __eou__ But I just got a call from my sister and I have to cancel the movie tonight . __eou__
What's the news on our website ? How effective do you think it is from a marketing standpoint ? __eou__ We've been able to survey and track some of the information of our website users through some cookie technology , and it's surprising to see the results . __eou__ What kinds of hits are we getting on our company's website ? __eou__ From the numbers , it seems nearly half of the visitors who stumble onto our page pick up the link not from network browsers or search engines , but from our circular insert . That means our consumers are purposefully and actively seeking information about our products and services through the web format . Based on these findings , I am completely convinced the internet is the marketing power of the future ! __eou__ You really think that many people turn to the internet to find product information.What about the old standbys of word mouth and print media ? __eou__ Well , these mediums are still important ... they aren't a thing of the past ... But I think they might be less important now than in the past . The technology age has arrived ! __eou__
Have you decided what you are going to take next semester ? __eou__ Well , I'm an English major , you know.So I came here to make sure I'm taking the right things . __eou__ Good . I think it's a good idea . Our department should require meetings like this . __eou__ I want to finish my degree in four years.So I don't want to forget to take classes I need . I have a friend who has to stay in college another year.She didn't know until recently . There were some classes she needed to take to graduate.She didn't know about them . __eou__ Yes , that happens . __eou__ I brought my transcript from my first year.Here . And here is the list of courses I plan to take in the fall . __eou__ Alright . Good . I see you've already taken six credits of your breadth requirements.You have one botany class and one chemistry class . And political science.So that's nine credits . Did you take English Composition 201 ? __eou__ No , I don't need to . I took Advanced Placement English in high school.So I'm not required to take composition . __eou__ Excellent . I see you have the 18th century poetry class for next semester.And the modern novel class . You haven't taken a Shakespeare class yet . __eou__ No , I thought I would take it later . __eou__ Actually , I recommend you take Shakespeare sooner rather than later . __eou__ Well , I suppose I could cross out the 18th century poetry class . I have to see when the Shakespeare class meets . __eou__ Let me look at the timetable.Shakespeare meets Monday , Wednesday and Friday at 11 __eou__ I can take it then . I have that time slot free . __eou__ Good . I recommend it . Shakespeare is of course enormously important.We want our students to take the class as soon as they can.And Professor Friedman is an excellent teacher . __eou__ I'll take it then . __eou__ Tell me , Lisa , what made you decide to be an English major ? __eou__ I want to be an English professor in the future . I love studying literature , and I want to teach it . __eou__ Really ? That's great to know . __eou__ That's the reason I want to finish my B . A . in four years.Because I know I will be in school a long time . I want to start the M . A . and Ph . D . program as soon as possible . __eou__
Would you talk to me about taking one of Dr . Miller's classes ? __eou__ Yes . Have you ever been in one of his classes ? __eou__ I'm thinking about taking his class next semester . __eou__ He was a very easy teacher . Are you thinking of taking a class with him ? __eou__ I'm not sure because I really need to learn something , but I also worry about grades . __eou__ Grades are important , but don't you think that gaining the knowledge is important , too ? __eou__ I really need to learn this stuff . __eou__ He made everything so interesting that the time just flew by . Do you know what I mean ? __eou__ Yes , that sounds right for me . __eou__ Did you know that he came here last year after 10 years in the military ? __eou__ Yeah , I already knew that . That could be a good thing . __eou__ I think you know that you have to make the best decision for you . Enjoy your year ! __eou__
What can I do for you ? __eou__ I would like to open another account . __eou__ What kind do you want to open ? __eou__ I want to open a savings account . __eou__ Do you have an account opened with this bank already ? __eou__ Yes , I do . __eou__ You can always transfer money from that account into your new one . __eou__ That would be great . __eou__ How much money do you want to transfer ? __eou__ I want to transfer $ 100 . __eou__ I ’ ll do that right now . __eou__ All right .

And do not forget to take two sleeping pills before going to bed . __eou__
How many people are traveling with you today , miss ? __eou__ Just me .

Excuse me , what's the screen near your steering wheel for ? __eou__ It's a portable TV . It's a popular thing now . __eou__ Oh , that's new to me . So what's on everyday ? __eou__ News about current affairs , documentaries , music , movies , noncommercial ads and so on . __eou__ Is there anything interesting ? __eou__ Yes , there are something good and informative . I think that many people underestimate the value of TV in education . __eou__ I agree . Are there any commercials on the TV ? __eou__ Of course . Because the TV stations need to make money from commercials between the programs . __eou__ That makes a lot of sense . Does the TV work well ? __eou__ Not always . It depends on the transmission of the satellite signals . __eou__ I got it . Do you pay for the programs ? __eou__ Yes , 50 Yuan per month . __eou__

If they don ’ t have it , no one will . __eou__ After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I ’ m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice . __eou__

They are a bit sticky . __eou__ I can fix those for you . Is there anything else wrong with it ? __eou__ Well , my saddle is too low for me . Do you know how to change the height ? __eou__ That's easy .

Just amazing ! __eou__ No doubt , it's not a simple thing to put on a ' phantom show ' . __eou__ Exactly . __eou__

Where is the bus ? __eou__ I think it's running late . __eou__ It should've been here 30 minutes ago . __eou__ It should be coming soon . __eou__ It better , because I'm already late for work . __eou__ I can't stand riding the bus . __eou__ Me too , it's so unreliable . __eou__ That is true . __eou__ It's also horrible having to be at a bus stop in any kind of weather . __eou__ Exactly.That ' s the worst part . __eou__ I think it's time we started driving . __eou__ Yes , I agree . __eou__

Lily thinks that the job takes a back seat to the family after she is married . __eou__ She must be a good wife . __eou__ Not necessarily . This is only what she says , not what she does . __eou__ I see . __eou__
Susan , Is the manager in this office ? __eou__ Yes . But he is meeting a client . __eou__ Oh , that's too bad . I just got a phone call saying that my wife is now in the hospital .

Mary , you have found several companies that are hiring , right ? __eou__ Yes , I have found three companies . __eou__ Have you called to inquire about the positions ? __eou__ Yes , but the results are not so satisfying . __eou__ What's the matter ? __eou__ I asked the first company about the vacancy , but they had already hired someone . __eou__ What a pity ! __eou__ The second one told me that the job information was released half a year ago , and had been overdue . __eou__ It's frustrating ! __eou__ The last company is still hiring , but not recent graduates . __eou__ Wonder why they do that ! __eou__ I feel terrible now . __eou__ Don't be discouraged .

What ’ s the life expectancy in your country ? __eou__ I ’ m not sure , but probably about 75 years . How about in your country ? __eou__ About 70 , I think . This newspaper article talks about the problems of an aging population . It ’ s a problem that will soon affect most of the world . __eou__ I heard that the government might need to increase the retirement age , because otherwise there will not be enough workers to support the young and the elderly . __eou__ Perhaps we need to have more babies ! Tina gave birth to a baby boy yesterday . __eou__ Did she ? That ’ s great . However , if we have too many children , that will have a bad effect on the enviroment . __eou__ How ’ s your son these days ? __eou__ Oh , he ’ s fine . Kids seem to grow up very quickly nowadays . __eou__ He ’ ll be a teenager before you know it ! Teenagers are often rebellious ! When do you mine it is a good age to have a child ? __eou__ I had mine when I was 24 . that ’ s a little young . I ’ d suggest you wait until you are in your late twenties . , or even in your early thirties if you have a good career . __eou__ Yes , I think you ’ re right . I ’ m thinking about having a child , but not just yet . __eou__ Is there a big generation gap between parents and their children in you country ? __eou__ Yes , there is . Teenagers do not want to live traditional lives . They want to go out , have fun , and explore the world . They want to develop their own view of life . Parents usually try to discourage them , but they don ’ t often succeed . __eou__ Parents usually give their children more freedom in my country . Sometimes they give them too much freedom . __eou__ It ’ s almost impossible to get the right balance . If you are too strict , kids might ignore you . If you are too lenient , they might go wild . __eou__
This looks wonderful , Madame Culot . __eou__ Yes , it's very nice . All our foreign visitors enjoy it . The food is wonderfully well-prepared .

It sounds horrible but it's actually really good . __eou__ Mmm . Maybe another time . __eou__ You could try the ravioli . They are rather like your Chinese dumplings , and the sauce is delicious . __eou__ Sounds good . I think I'll have the lamb for my main course . What does it come with ? __eou__ Well , you can have fries-French fries-or simple boiled potatoes . __eou__ I'll have the potatoes . What are you having ? __eou__ I'm having my usual . I like the fish here . Would you like some wine ? __eou__ Oh , yes . That would be lovely . __eou__
Is there anything I can do for you ? __eou__ Yes , I joined your group of bus tour this morning .

We will look into this matter . Would you please wait a moment here ? __eou__
What do you expect of the position ? __eou__ I hope to apply my knowledge and experience on the job and make further improvement . __eou__ What do you think about occupational planning ? __eou__ It is quite important for all of us .

And whatever job I may take , I will make the best efforts . __eou__ If confronted with difficult task , what will you do ? __eou__ I will make full use of the chance and get myself ready for the challenges all the time . __eou__ Would you care much about your salary ? __eou__ Salary is , admittedly , important , but I will care more about what I can learn from the job . __eou__ If you were assigned some work which you are not so interested , would you take it or not ? __eou__ I would take it . After all , interest is not the only thing one should care about . __eou__

Oh , yeah , you'll see . __eou__ Come on , grow up . Have you seen Vince around ? __eou__
Ms.Green , are the schools more or less similar everywhere throughout the United States , or do they differ in various sections ? __eou__ The system of public schools is fairly uniform everywhere throughout the United States . __eou__ Do most students in the United States attend private schools or public schools ? __eou__ Most public schools in the United States are very good , and the majority of students attend the public schools . __eou__ Which students go to private schools , then ? __eou__ Children needing special instruction . Children whose parents can afford to send them to private schools , and children whose parents want them to receive a religious education . __eou__ But are the public schools good everywhere ? __eou__ No , public schools can be very different . Even in the same city . __eou__ Dose it cost anything to attend the public schools ? Are there any restrictions as to who may and may not attend ? __eou__ The public schools in the United States are free to everyone and there is no cost to the student . In most states , even the textbooks are free . There are no restrictions as to color , race , or religion.Any student wishing to attend the public schools may do so . __eou__

From me you won't hear another peep . I hope you wreck your jeep . __eou__ Right . That one . Did it work ? __eou__

What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ I have a really bad toothache ! My cheek is swollen and I can ’ t eat anything . __eou__ Let ’ s have a look . Mmmm . This doesn ’ t look too good . I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth . It ’ s pressing against your molars and that ’ s one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain __eou__ When you pull my tooth will you also have to extract the nerve and the root ? __eou__ First we will take some x-rays and see what we ’ re dealing with . I also noticed a small cavity up front here , so you are going to need a filling . __eou__ I guess that ’ s what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day . __eou__ It could be that , or maybe you are eating too many sweets . In any case , I ’ ll administer an anesthetic and you won ’ t feel a thing ! __eou__
Can you imagine having a million dollars ? __eou__ Yes , and I know a few things I'd spend the money on . __eou__ Yeah , me too . __eou__ A new car for a start . __eou__
What should we do this Saturday ? __eou__ Rocky six is suppose to come out this Friday . __eou__ Yeah , but I don't know if it is going to be any good . __eou__ The only reason I want to see it is because I have seen the previous five . __eou__ True . Ok . Let's see it this Saturday . __eou__ How about we hook up for lunch at 12:00 , and then go see the movie afterwards . __eou__ Sounds like a plan . Let's meet in front of Tower Records at 12:00 . __eou__
( A stranger stops to help ) Everything OK ? __eou__ No ! My tour bus got a speeding ticket not ten minutes ago . Now my engine is on fire ! __eou__ I think that's just steam . Your engine's overheated . __eou__ Do you know a lot about cars ? __eou__ A little bit . I'll take a look if you want me to . __eou__ Please . Thank you so much for stopping . __eou__ Yeah , she's hot . Radiator's leaking . Looks like you were running her pretty hard . __eou__ That must have been just before I got the speeding ticket . __eou__ Did you have an accident recently ... Hey , wait a second ! I know this car ! __eou__ You do ? __eou__ I ran into it a couple of weeks ago . What do you know ? Name's Hal . __eou__ I'm Akimbo . Nice to meet you , I guess . __eou__ Boy , I'm sure sorry about your car . Hey , Akimbo , I wonder if you'd like to make a deal ? __eou__ What kind of deal ? __eou__ I'd like to give you cash for the damage to your car . __eou__ You don't want your insurance company to pay for it ? __eou__ I'd rather not . They'll raise my rates . It'll cost me more in the long run . __eou__ If you give me cash , do you care if I don't fix the car ? __eou__ Hell , I don't care . Just don'T submit a report to your insurancecompany . __eou__ It's a deal , Hal . Thanks again for stopping to help . And thanks for smashing my car ! __eou__
Hi , John . What brings you to town ? __eou__ Hi , Mary . Lily wanted me to buy her some things for the party . __eou__ What do you think of the traffic today ? __eou__ It ’ s pretty bad . __eou__ Yeah . You can say that again . It ’ s noisy too . __eou__ I am glad I did not drive a car . __eou__
I'm sorry . Is that bicycle yours ? __eou__ Yes , it is . What about it ? __eou__ I backed into it while I was trying to get into the parking lot . __eou__ I see . __eou__ I'm really sorry . I'll face the music . __eou__ Where did you hit it ? __eou__ Right here . See the scratch ? __eou__ Oh , Yes , I see it now . __eou__
What would you like for dessert ? __eou__ What do you have ? __eou__ I have apple pie , ice cream , chocolate cake and fruit cocktail . __eou__ Can I have apple pie with ice cream ? __eou__ Of course . I made the apple pie this morning , so it ’ s lovely and fresh . __eou__ I love your home-made apple pie.It ’ s delicious.Can I have another glass of lemonade as well ? __eou__ Sure.Can you get it yourself , it ’ s in the refrigerator . __eou__ Ok.Would you like a drink too ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ ll have an ice tea.You see it next to the lemonade . __eou__ Are you having any dessert ? __eou__ I ’ ll have apple pie too , but without ice cream . I have to watch my weight . __eou__

You will find our price comes in line with the prevailing market . __eou__ Your price is rather high . We cannot accept it . Can you bring the price down a little ? __eou__ In fact , if it weren't for our good relations , we wouldn't consider making you a firm order at this price . __eou__ I can't agree with you . We have quotation from other sources too . Their prices are lower than yours . __eou__ But you know our design is superior to any other products from other companies . In fact , there is no room to negotiate the price now . You should be aware that the production cost alone has doubled in the past year . __eou__ It doesn't seem very hopeful to close the deal on this price . __eou__
How ’ s it going ? __eou__ I ’ m great . Thanks . __eou__ What do you need ? __eou__ I need to know if I have any fees to pay . __eou__ Actually , you do owe some fees . __eou__ How much do I owe ? __eou__ Your fees total $ 235.13 . __eou__ That ’ s crazy ! __eou__ You need to pay these fees soon . __eou__ Can I do that right now ? __eou__ Will you be paying with cash or check ? __eou__ I think I ’ ll be paying with cash . __eou__

Hey , Jordan , is that you ? Long time no see ! __eou__ Oh , hey , no kidding ! I haven't seen you since orientation three months ago ! So how've you been ? Settling into college life OK ? __eou__ Yeah , I think so ! I pledged Phi Iota Alpha , so I'm living at the frat house now . __eou__ Oh , so you're a frat boy now , huh ? __eou__ Yeah , yeah , I know , it's totally cliche , but really , I think it's been a good decision . I've got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys . What about you ? What have you been up to ? __eou__ Not much . I'm still living at home and commuting to school . I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about . It just wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped . The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count . __eou__ That sounds smart ... but kind of boring . __eou__ Yeah , it is , a little bit . I joined the Great Outdoors Club , though , which has been a lot of fun . We've gone on two camping trips already , and I've made some good friends . __eou__ That's cool . Hey , so have you decided on your major yet ? __eou__ Definitely pre-med . What about you ? __eou__ I still have no clue ... but we don't have to declare a major till our sophomore year , so I've got time ! Oops , I'm late for class . Gotta run ! __eou__ OK , take care ! Hey , nice running into you ! __eou__ Yeah , you too ! __eou__

Well , Yuri , tell me about it . __eou__ I'm sorry I can't bring better news , sir . The site is a disaster . __eou__ That's what I was afraid of . __eou__ It is not only the earthquake , sir . But the mudslides.Much of the north half of the site has been covered over by mud . __eou__ Mud ? But Ivan told me there were no mudslides in that district . I thought all the mudslides were down in Chichitango . __eou__ That's what we thought , sir . That's what the news reported.But there was one little mudslide in our district too . Right above our site . __eou__ Oh , that's terrible ! What bad luck ! I wish we had never come to this country.But , if it isn't the strikes and the revolutionaries , it's the earthquakes.Our operations here are finished ! __eou__ I'm sorry , sir . __eou__ It's not your fault , Yuri.But tell me . When will Ivan be able to get out there ? __eou__ Well , it took me about nine hours to get back here by car.If Ivan leaves tonight , I think he should be there by tomorrow lunch . __eou__ Good . I want an estimate of damages as soon as possible . __eou__ But sir ... __eou__ Yes , Yuri ? __eou__ I wouldn't recommend sending Ivan now.Especially not at night . The roads aren't safe . __eou__ Has the earthquake damaged the bridges too ? __eou__ No , sir . The bridges are fine.But I've heard rumors that the revolutionaries are coming down from the mountains.There has been fighting , sir . __eou__ Are you serious ? Fighting ? But I didn't hear anything on the news . __eou__ You know the government controls the press here , sir . They don't want it reported . __eou__ Oh , this is terrible , Yuri . Terrible ! So we can't even assess the damages . How can we do business in this country ? Either we're buried under mud , or we're in danger of getting kidnapped.No , I can't believe this mess ! __eou__ I'm sorry , sir . __eou__ You don't have to keep saying that , Yuri . It's not your fault.But me--I'm the one who should be sorry.It was me who suggested operations here in the first place ! Oh , what can we do ? __eou__
Are you doing anything tonight ? __eou__ No , nothing . Why ? __eou__ Do you like western music ? __eou__ Yes , I do , very much . __eou__ There ’ s a concert tonight . Would you like to go and listen to it ? __eou__ Oh , yes . I ’ d love to . __eou__

Let ’ s play a little game . I ’ ll describe someone and you try to guess who it is . __eou__ Ok . I ’ m really bored at the moment . __eou__ Ok . This man is tall and slim . He ’ s got blue eyes and curly brown hair . __eou__ Does he have a moustache or a beard ? __eou__ Good question . Yes , he has a moustache , but no beard . __eou__ Sounds like Mike , is it ? __eou__ Yes , it is . You describe someone we both know . __eou__ Right . She ’ s not very tall and she ’ s quite plump . She ’ s got blonder hair , but I don ’ t know what color her eyes are . __eou__ Is she attractive ? I don ’ t think I know anyone like that . __eou__ Well , I don't find her attractive , but I'm sure you will disagree . __eou__ I like slim girls , so I doubt I would find a plump girl attractive . You ’ ll have to give me some more information . __eou__ She ’ s got tiny feet and wears really unfashionable shoes . In fact , she wears unfashionable clothes too . __eou__ This doesn ’ t sound like anyone I know . I give up . Teel me who she is . __eou__ She ’ s your mother ! __eou__ How embarrassing ! I don ’ t even recognize a description of my own mother ! How important do you think appearance is ? __eou__ I think that unfortunately it ’ s more important than a person ’ s character . Advertising and stuff tells us that we have to be attractive . I think it ’ s wrong , but that ’ s the way the world is now . __eou__ I ’ m afraid you ’ re right . I chose my girlfriend because she has a wonderful personality . __eou__ Well , you certainly didn ’ t choose her because of her looks ! Hey , I was joking ! Don ’ t hit me ! __eou__
Wow ! What a beautiful scenic spot ! It's so open . And just breathe that fresh air , you can almost taste its freshness . __eou__ You can have a bird view of Guiling City from the top of the mountain . __eou__ Wonderful ! I'll often come here for mountain climbing . __eou__ You should . Many Guiliners , especially the old and the young , will climb mountains here in the morning . __eou__ No wonder people say __eou__ Quick ! Pass me your binoculars . Look at that bird ... I've never seen one of those before . It's indigenous to Guiling , and an endangered species too . This is lucky ! __eou__ I didn't know you liked bird-watching . __eou__ I don't really . I just like wildlife , and you don't get to see too much of it in the city . This place is full of it . __eou__
Hi ! What are you watching ? __eou__ It ’ s a programme about islam . It ’ s very interesting . __eou__ Wow ! So many people ! Where are they and what are they doing ? __eou__ They are muslims on a pilgrimage to mecca . Muslims call this pilgrimage haj . __eou__ Why do they go there ? __eou__ Muslims believe that every man who is able should go on a haj at least once in his life . Mecca is the spiritual centre of the muslim faith . __eou__ When muslims pray , they face towards mecca . __eou__ That ’ s right . Unfortunately , so many people go on the haj each year that there are often stamped and people get killed . __eou__ I heard about that . The pilgrims must walk around a large , sacred black stone . __eou__ That ’ s right . That ’ s when accidents often happen . The Saudi government tries to limit the number of pilgrims , to reduce the chances of accidents . __eou__ Pilgrimages are common in many faiths . __eou__ Yes . In England , Christian pilgrims might go to Canterbury and many Christians go to the Vatican on pilgrimages . __eou__ Isn ’ t there a place in france where people go to get healed ? __eou__ I think that place is Lourdes . There are many stories of people being healed after visiting there . __eou__ Do you think that there is something magical about that place ? __eou__ Personally . I think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them . I don ’ t think place is magical in any way . __eou__
Watsup , ladies ! Y'll looking ’ fine tonight . May I have this dance ? __eou__ He's cute ! He looks like Tiger Woods ! But , I can't dance ... __eou__ It's all good . I'll show you all the right moves . My name's Malik . __eou__ Nice to meet you . I'm Wen , and this is Nikki . __eou__ How you feeling ’ , vista ? Mind if I take your friend ' round the dance floor ? __eou__ She doesn't mind if you don't mind getting your feet stepped on . __eou__ Right . Cool ! Let's go ! __eou__

Belgium ? __eou__ Actually , the factory is located in Scotland . __eou__ Really ? I didn ’ t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production __eou__ That ’ s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . They ’ Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . Here , I brought these especially for you , try one ! __eou__ Oh , thanks . Mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth ... __eou__ Unique , aren ’ t they ? I bet you ’ Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ’ s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection . __eou__ Yes , very interesting flavors ... Slightly spicy , very unique , that ’ s for sure . Exactly what ARE the ingredients ? __eou__ I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations .

Did your company go union ? I heard that many companies in out industry are being unionized , so It's getting harder and harder to compete on a level playing field . __eou__ Yes , we're hopping on the bandwagon and signing up for the union . Mostly people are pretty happy about it ... I guess it depends on if you are in management or in the labor force . __eou__ Management isn't looking on the labor unions too favorably , I'd guess . I don't blame them ... labor unions can really put the squeeze on the executives . __eou__ Sure ... but it's probably better for the workers , because the union's whole purpose is to look out for the little guys .

Come in , Arnold . Have a seat . __eou__ Good morning . __eou__ Would you like something to drink ? __eou__ No , thank you . I just had two cups of coffee at my desk . __eou__ So , you're a serious coffee drinker . __eou__ Yes , it keeps me going . Sometimes I think I'm addicted . __eou__ Well , coffee isn't such a bad thing.Everyone has to have something.For me , it's cigars . Are you a cigar smoker ? __eou__ No , I've tried them . But I'm not really a smoker . __eou__ Well , what would you like to talk to me about ? __eou__ I wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal . __eou__ I'm glad when people have new ideas around here . Tell me about it . __eou__ It is about the staff meetings.You know how we have a staff meeting every Tuesday . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Well , I have been thinking about it.And I believe we could do things more efficiently here . __eou__ What do you suggest ? __eou__ The way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week.We meet for one hour . But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation . __eou__ You mean because people have to go across town to get here . __eou__ Yes . Some people spend half of the morning on the road . __eou__ That's true . But our staff meetings are very important , Arnold . I don't know how we can function without them . __eou__ I think they are important too.That ' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them . __eou__ I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . I'm aware of that . __eou__ Here's what I propose . I think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more . __eou__ Well . __eou__ I also think the meetings should be more focused.And I would be willing to take responsibility for that . __eou__ You mean you want to run the meetings ? __eou__ No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better . __eou__ Hmm . But we would meet every two weeks . __eou__ I really think it would work.The meetings could be longer , and better organized . __eou__ I am not against the idea , Arnold.It may really be more efficient , as you say . I'll tell you what we can do.Why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works . __eou__ Excellent . I would be happy to get started on it . __eou__ I will call the managers.Then tomorrow I'll tell you when we can schedule our first meeting in this " new style . " __eou__

Hey there Chris , what are you up to ? __eou__ I'm just poring over some brochures about various car models . __eou__ Oh , so you're thinking about buying a new car ? __eou__ Yeah , it looks that way . My wife has been bugging me about it . I thought we could probably survive without one , but with a baby on the way , maybe it is time to get a car . __eou__ So this would be your first automobile ? __eou__ That's right . For quite a few years , I rode a bicycle to work . Then I got a motorbike . __eou__ Yeah , I think I can understand your wife's position . Asking her to ride on a motorcycle when she's pregnant is a tall order . __eou__ Oh ... I don't let her ride with me . It's just too dangerous . She takes the bus to work , but it is sometimes difficult to get a seat and it's crowded and hot . __eou__ So it's time to buy your very first car ! Wow , that's exciting ! __eou__ Yes , but it's also a pretty big financial responsibility . __eou__ Yeah . I still remember my first car . It was an old clunker that my dad gave me when I turned 17 . I drove it around for a couple of years until I scraped together enough money to buy a better secondhand car . __eou__ I'm having a hard time deciding which model is best for us . __eou__ Yeah , it is a tough call . Each one has its pros and cons . Are you looking for a sedan ? __eou__ Yes , I'd like a Jeep , but my wife says we have to get a comfortable sedan for long drives home to see her relatives . __eou__ I'd advise you to listen to your wife . She will be sitting in the back taking care of the kids so whatever she prefers is probably the best choice . __eou__

I couldn't live without her . __eou__ I will try my best to persuade her to reconsider the divorce . But are you sure that from now on you will be faithful to her forever ? __eou__ Yes , I swear . __eou__
I'm looking for some black pumps to go with my evening gown . Could you show me what you have ? __eou__ Sure , we have several different styles you may choose . How high of a heel do you want ? __eou__ Not to high , maybe an inch or an inch in the half would be the best . __eou__ In that case , I might have just the pair for you . Look at these , they were made in Italy , the leather is very soft , so your toes will not get pinched . You can tell just by looking at it that it was superbly made . __eou__ Those are beautiful .

But I must warn you that if it does show to be a counterfeit I have no option but to confiscate it . __eou__ I understand . To be honest , I'll be glad to get rid of it if it is a fake . __eou__ The machine shows it to be counterfeit .

It's very nice and latest in style . __eou__ Oh , this one is perfect . __eou__

Now darling , I know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . I think we should sell it . __eou__ Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know . Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more . __eou__ But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating .

But I still think we've made a good buy . __eou__

K . But it really was too hot.And I think they should show people more . The exhibits should be more interesting . __eou__ I thought it was great . Didn't you like the special effects rooms ? __eou__ Yes , but I still think it could be better . __eou__
Daniel . Mind your eye ! __eou__ I will , mom . Don ’ t worry . __eou__

You may not get enough vitamins from your food , you know . __eou__ But , I don't believe in taking pills to get enough vitamins . __eou__ How's that . __eou__ Because it's better , easier and cheaper to get them from the food we eat . __eou__
Would you like to know about benefits and so forth ? __eou__ Please . Everyone enjoys hearing the benefits of something ! __eou__ With this agreement we can bring over you many benefits . For example , head offices of your group companies can get really prompt integrated fund transfers and centralised allocations . This helps internal supervision and admin run smoothly . __eou__ That is wonderful . We've been having serious problems in that area . Our internal accounts seem so messy at the moment , nothing is running smoothly and it's costing us time and money . __eou__ Hopefully signing up for this Network Settlement Service will solve all of that . If you are sure , we can go ahead now , Sir . How does 10 am tomorrow sound , to get all of the paperwork out of the way ? __eou__
Good afternoon , Peace Hotel , what can I do for you ? __eou__ I have made a reservation for this Sunday . My name is Bobby __eou__ Yes , that's right .

Leo , she started yelling at him . You should have heard her . I ’ Ve never seen anyone get so upset before . To make a long story short , it seems that Mr . Leo failed her because he caught her cheating . __eou__ That ’ s no laughing matter . That means she ’ ll have to take the whole course again . I can ’ t believe she ’ s going to have to start from the beginning . __eou__ It serves her right ! __eou__

I had a busy morning . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ I watered all the plants . __eou__ You have a lot of plants . __eou__ Then I did my laundry . __eou__ That takes some time . __eou__ I took the dog for a walk . __eou__ I'll bet he enjoyed his walk . __eou__ I vacuumed the entire house . __eou__ That's a lot of work . __eou__ And then I made lunch . __eou__ I'll bet you were hungry ! __eou__

I'm afraid to be alone . __eou__ Sure . I can come over . What should we do ? __eou__ How about if we watch a comedy . I need something to get my mind off the frightening images I have from the Sixth Sense . __eou__ Ok . I'll get ready and leave . I'll see you in about 20 minutes . __eou__ Hurry , ok .

What kind of packing do you plan to use for this consignment of goods ? __eou__ Cartons . Is that okay ? __eou__ I'm concerned about the possible jolting , squeezing and collision that may take place when these cases are moved about . __eou__ Well , what I can tell you is this . We've got an excellent record on making deliveries to our customers . Besides , all our cartons are lined with shockproof cardboards and are wrapped up with polyethylene sheets . So they're not only shockproof but also dampproof . __eou__ In that case , I guess I can rest assured . __eou__ Well , I guess you can say that . The safety of packing is something we always pay a lot of attention to . Especially for those fragile commodities , we've got to be extra careful . Otherwise , if the things we don't want to see happened , we would be responsible and that'll cause you a lot of inconvenience , too . __eou__ You're right . But wouldn't it be safer to use wooden cases ? __eou__ We sure can if you want us to , but the charge will be much higher . __eou__ It wouldn't be worth the trouble in that case , would it ? Let's still use cartons . __eou__ Sure , no problem . As I said , cartons are good enough for goods like this . You don't have to worry about it . __eou__

I've got to put together a sales pitch to give to our clients in the morning . You always give such amazing presentations , I was hoping you could give me some advice about how to win them over tomorrow . __eou__ Sure , it's easy . First of all , the secret to a successful oral presentation is to keep things simple . People are listening and they usually don't have a long attention spans . Stick to about three or four points , give an overview of the points , then present them one by one , and then summarize at the end . Be straightforward and organized and you're sure to be remembered . __eou__ What kind of visuals should I use to support the presentation ? Do you think I should use PowerPoint ? __eou__ You should consider the size and interests of your audience . In other words , who is listening , and what do they want to hear ... you can put together a PPT with some graphics and animations that will catch people's attention , but be careful not to go overboard . __eou__ I think I can put something together , no problem . But when it comes to tomorrow , I'll just be a bundle of nerves ! How can I get over my fear of speaking in public ? __eou__ You know , stage fright is very normal , most people get nervous before they have to speak in front of large groups . Just prepare well , rehearse beforehand , and trust that you will be great ... and you will be ! __eou__

David , I am going for an interview tomorrow . It's an American company . Can you give me an idea of what the interviewer will ask ? __eou__ Well . They may ask you to tell them more about your educational background and your working background . __eou__ But they can see my resume . It's all in there . __eou__ I know , but sometimes interviewers just want to hear you say it . Then you may be asked for your viewpoint on why you feel you are qualified for the job , give them all your qualifications and how you think they will fit the position you are applying for . Questions like what sort of experience do you have and what are your goals ? are closely related to this . __eou__ Ok . What else ? __eou__ They may want to know how the company will benefit and why they should hire you ? __eou__ I see . What about the salary ? __eou__ Hm , they may ask you what kind of salary you have in mind , or simply tell you what the company is offering . I think the latter is more likely for a starting position , especially if you have little experience . And if they are seriously considering hiring you , they will probably want to know when you would be available to start work . And basically , that's about it . __eou__ Ok , thanks , David . You ’ Ve helped me a lot . __eou__ Anytime . Let me know how it works out . __eou__
Mom , what were movies like when you were a kid ? __eou__ Everything about them was different , even the theaters . __eou__ I'm really interested .

I bet you could bring your own food . __eou__ We did . On hot days , we'd take a blanket and lay in the back of dad's old pickup to watch the movie . __eou__ Why don't we do that anymore ? __eou__ Well , the weather might have some influence , during bad weather the theater didn't make a whole lot . __eou__
Hey , daughter , let me ask you something . __eou__ Yes , dad ? __eou__ Do you have life insurance ? __eou__ Well , no . It just seemed like another bill we ’ d have to pay . __eou__ You have children now . What if something , God forbid , happens to you ? __eou__ That ’ s true .

Hi , Mark . __eou__ Hi , Bill . I ’ d like to take the apartment I looked at yesterday . __eou__ All right . __eou__ So , what do we do now ? __eou__ This is the lease . You should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant . The lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords . __eou__ Okay . ( Reads the lease ) So , according to the lease , I ’ ll deposit one month ’ s rent as a security deposit , and I have to pay the first month ’ s rent in advance . I understand that I ’ ll get the security deposit back when I move out if the apartment does not need any costly repairs . __eou__ Yes . If you do not damage the apartment , you will get your security deposit back when you move out . __eou__ Can I pay you by check ? __eou__ Sure . A check will be fine . __eou__ Is there a laundry room in the basement ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Can I sign the lease right now ? __eou__
I think we should do the floors before we work on the curtains and walls . __eou__ Why ? it doesn't make sense . If we do the floors first , and then paint the walls , we will get paint all over our new floor . __eou__ Hmm Maybe you're right . But I can't stand all this green carpet here . And besides , I know how to paint . I will just cover everything with drop cloth . I won't get anything on the floor . __eou__ Are you sure ? __eou__ Yes , I'm sure I've done a lot of house painting in my life . And my mother was very picky . If I got even a tiny drop of paint on her furniture , she would get furious . So I learned to be very careful . __eou__ Alright . Then maybe we can do the floor first . These wood floors under this carpet are beautiful . And me too — — I can't wait to get all this old carpet out of here . But how can we get it out ? Do we have to hire someone ? __eou__ Absolutely not . We can remove the carpet ourselves . Carpet is held down with carpet nails . You just need to pull it hard and it will come up . __eou__ Great . Then , after we remove the carpet , we need to redo all the wood floors . Right ? __eou__ Yes . But we should hire someone for that . That will probably be expensive . And it has to be done right . __eou__ And then , after the floors are done , we can start to move our furniture in . __eou__ Sure . If we can get an appointment with someone to do the floors , we should probably be able to have the furniture in here after a week or so . I can get all the carpet out this weekend . __eou__
Will we drive to the seaside ? __eou__ Yes , it will take about four hours . We can leave about noon and get there by supper time . __eou__ Let me help pay for gas . __eou__ All right . There will be three of us going so we will each pay a third . __eou__ What other expenses will we have ? __eou__ There won't be many other expenses expect food . __eou__
Morgan , can I ask you a question ? __eou__ sure , what is it ? __eou__ I was just wondering if many Chinese people take their leftover food home from a restaurant . __eou__ in most cities in China , doggie bags are quite uncommon . __eou__ what happen to all the leftover food ? __eou__ it usually goes to the dump . __eou__ that seems like an awful waste ! Why don't people order fewer dishes so that they don't have to throw so much away at the end of the meal ? __eou__ ordering a lot of food at restaurants is just a tradition in China . You know , in the past , people could not afford to eat out like they can today . __eou__ I guess that makes sense . I just think it would make more sense to take the leftovers home . __eou__ well , if you want , you can take the leftovers home . __eou__ no , that's OK . You know what they say when in Rome ... __eou__ I was impressed that you tried the pig's feet . I heard that many foreigners don't like to eat them . __eou__ many people in my generation don't eat pig's feet , but my parents grew up eating them , so I think they are OK . __eou__ did you like them ? You could take the last one home with you . __eou__ that's OK . I'll try anything once , but sometimes , once is enough ! __eou__
Why are you walking to and fro in the room ? __eou__ I ’ m worrying about the children . After all this is the first time they have been out without us . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . They are grown-ups . __eou__ I know . But I couldn ’ t help . __eou__
Excuse me , is there any room available ? I want a single one . __eou__ Yes . When do you want it ? __eou__ Next Today . By the way , is there a closed circuit TV ? __eou__ Yes , sir . __eou__ What about laundry ? __eou__ Sorry , sir . You have to pay by yourself . __eou__
How are you feeling ? __eou__ Bad . My nose keeps running . And my forehead is burning . __eou__ You said you never went to hospital . __eou__ I will get better soon . __eou__ The good thing is you don't need to go to school . __eou__ Yeah , I love that , no class , no homework , and no exams . __eou__ And your Mom and Dad will buy you anything you ask for . __eou__ Haha , I just got the Ultraman costume . My Dad bought it . __eou__ I really envy you , Danny . __eou__ Come on , I got numerous shots for that . You have no idea what I've been through with the needles . __eou__ Your sister said you fainted three times during the injection . __eou__ May told you ? Oh , May , she's such a tattletale . __eou__ No matter what , you are still my hero , Daniel . __eou__ Tom , promise me to keep this a secret , will you ? __eou__ OK , I promise . You promise you will be well soon ? __eou__ Deal . __eou__
What subject do you like best ? __eou__ English is my favorite . __eou__ No wonder your English is so good . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Do you want to go to the beach tonight ? __eou__ Sure , which beach are we going to ? __eou__ I wanted to go to Malibu beach . __eou__ I like Santa Monica . __eou__ The water there looks so dirty . __eou__ I just like the pier they have at Santa Monica . __eou__ I like the pier too , because it's beautiful at night . __eou__ Is Malibu beach nice ? __eou__ It's a lot nicer , and I really like it better . __eou__ So you want to go to Malibu ? __eou__ If that's okay with you . __eou__ Sure , let's go to Malibu . __eou__
hello . How was the marketing meeting ? __eou__ hi . It was awful . I think I put forward some great ideas , but none of them were accepted . __eou__ I ’ m surprised to hear that . I thought you had some very good suggestions . __eou__ so did i . I ran the ideas by a few people before the meeting and their ideas seemed to have the supports of some people . __eou__ so what happened in the meeting ? __eou__ one or two people didn ’ t take to my ideas very well . That was to be expected . The worst thing was that the people who said the idea were good before the meeting didn ’ t support me during the meeting . __eou__ I wonder why not . We could always revise the suggestions , to take into account any objections . __eou__ that ’ s good advice , but I ’ m not confident that even revised proposals will be accepted . __eou__ may I make a suggestion ? __eou__ sure . I ’ m open to any reasonable suggestions . __eou__ Is there a chance you could contact the client confidentially and see what they think ? If they like your ideas , perhaps they could put them forward as their own proposals . You won ’ t get credit for ide __eou__ I ’ m not sure that ’ s a good idea . __eou__ go on . Take a chance . You could just hint at your idea . The client should be smart enough to take a hint . __eou__
I'm so tired ! I don't know how I'm going to make it through this lecture . __eou__ the professor is a bit boring today . You need something to perk yourself up . How about a coffee ? __eou__ I don't really like coffee , to be honest . It's too bitter for me . __eou__ well , you need something to wake you up . How about a soda ? __eou__ most some drinks have too much sugar in them . __eou__ the diet sodas don't have any caffeic in them , which one would you like ? __eou__ I like diet sprite . Does that have any caffeine in it ? __eou__ unfortunately , it doesn't . how about some diet coke ? __eou__ I don't care for coke . I heard that coke was first used as a medicine and I don't like medicine . What else has caffeine ? __eou__ maybe you should try a cappuccino or a latte ; they taste much better than plain brewed coffee . __eou__ maybe . How about a mochaccino ? Are they any good ? __eou__ you'll love that . It's just a shot of espresso beans mixed with steam milk and some chocolate syrup . __eou__ that's perfect ! Would you like one , too ? My treat . __eou__ thanks , but I'll stick with some jasmine tea . I'm trying to watch my diet . __eou__
Welcome ! Welcome to Little Italy . We're the most Italian family here ! __eou__ So I've heard . That's why I'm having such a great time . __eou__ If I hadn't married an Italian man , I probably wouldn't be pregnant so often . And maybe I could raise pigs instead of bambinos ! __eou__ Huh ? Um ... well , it's nice to see that some people still have big families . __eou__ It is nice , but it would be nicer if my macho husband would get off his tush and help me . Ha-ha ... Have this . It's from Italy ! __eou__

Let's go downstairs and have a look . __eou__ Sure . __eou__ These are the various kinds of packing for pliers . Normally , we have three types of packing __eou__ Oh , the packing looks very nice . __eou__ The skin packing is the most advanced packing for this product in the world market .

I like totally drew a blank on everything ! __eou__ Well , now you're really going to freak out when I tell you who aced it ... what's-her-face ... the one who always kisses up to the teacher . __eou__ Jennifer Davies ? Give me a break ! I can't stand her . She's such a dweeb ! How could she possibly ace it when she keeps cutting class all the time ? __eou__ She's the teacher's pet , that's why . Besides , he's so laid back he lets her get away with it . She just really rubs me the wrong way . And you know what ? I think she's got the hots for him , too . __eou__ Get out of here ! __eou__ I'm dead serious . Yesterday , before class starts , she walks up to Mr - Edward's desk and goes , ‘ Good morning , Jim . ’ __eou__ Oh , gag me ! She's totally gross ! __eou__
I've moved . __eou__ Where to ? __eou__
What kind of a car do you have ? __eou__ An old one . __eou__ I know it's old , but what make is it ? __eou__ It's a Chevrolet . Why do you ask ? You going into the car business ? __eou__ Nothing like that . My cousin is going to take a job overseas and he can't take his car with him , so he's going to sell it - cheap . It's practically new . __eou__ well I have been thinking about getting a newer car . I can't afford a brand new one . __eou__ Would you like to look at my cousin's car ? __eou__ Is it a four-door or a two-door ? __eou__ It's a coupe with a vinyl roof . __eou__ Does it have automatic transmission ? . __eou__ Yes , and it also has power steering , power brakes , and air conditioning . __eou__ I guess I might take a look at it . __eou__
Did you see the robbery ? __eou__ I sure did . __eou__ Did you see everything ? __eou__ I was in the bank at the time . __eou__ What exactly did you see ? __eou__ I saw the guy come in with a gun . __eou__ Did you get a good look at his face ? __eou__ He was wearing a mask . __eou__ Was anyone else with him ? __eou__ He came in alone . __eou__ Could you come to the station for more questioning ? __eou__ That'll be fine . __eou__
Hey Mike . What are you doing ? __eou__ Nothing much . What are you up to ? __eou__ I was just concerned about Sam . He hasn't been himself lately . __eou__ He took the civil service exam and failed . __eou__ That sucks . He must feel depressed . __eou__ Yeah . He's been sitting in his room everyday for the last 4 days . __eou__ Why don't we take him out ? We can try to take his mind off of it . In the least show him that we're there for him . __eou__ That's a great idea . Why don't you call him . I already talked to him a couple of times and it might be good for him to hear from somebody else . __eou__ Ok . I'll call you back after I'm done . __eou__ Sounds good . __eou__
I'm checking out in about half an hour . __eou__ Whenever you're ready to check out , I'll be ready , sir . __eou__ Great ! As you know however , the day in New York has hardly begun . __eou__ You're right . It's only 9 __eou__ Therefore , I think I'll explore New York some more . But I need to store my bags . __eou__ Sir , our storage facility is merely $ 5 an hour . You also need to leave a deposit . __eou__ My luggage isn't enough of a deposit ? __eou__ Unfortunately , it isn't . VISA or MasterCard will suffice , though . __eou__ Well , then . Let me put on my thinking cap for a moment . __eou__ Better hurry , sir . Remember you have to check out in less than half an hour . __eou__
Would you like to order now , madam ? __eou__ Yes , please . I'd like the steak and mushrooms . __eou__ How would you like your steak , rare , medium , or well-done ? __eou__ I'd like it well done , please . __eou__ What kind of potatoes would like to go with that , mushed , boiled , or baked ? __eou__ I think i have bake potatoes.And i now have a ice tea with lemon on the side , please . __eou__ Good , and would you care for soup or salad to start with ? __eou__ I'd like cream onion soup please . __eou__ Will you have desert to be , madam ? __eou__ I want to skip desert.That all , thank you . __eou__ OK , I'll be with you in a moment . __eou__
Hi , I need to make an appointment to see the doctor . __eou__ What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ I have a rash that I need a doctor to look at . __eou__ Do you have a fever with that rash ? __eou__ No , it just itches a lot . __eou__ I have openings on Tuesday or Wednesday .

It's your reading time now . __eou__ Mom , where is the remote ? I can't find it . __eou__ Just go to read . I will find it , honey . __eou__
what did you do over the weekend ? __eou__ I went a global warming rally in London . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment . __eou__ do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ? __eou__ it might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening . __eou__ like what ? __eou__ well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start . __eou__ what else can we do to protect the environment ? __eou__ if you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy . __eou__ how about recycling ? Does that actually help ? __eou__ yes . You should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center . __eou__ what do you think is the biggest worry for our future ? __eou__ I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone . __eou__ I had no idea you were such as environmentalist before ! __eou__ to be honest , in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place , we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment . __eou__
I'd like to apply for a credit card . Can you help me with my application ? __eou__ I'd be glad to . __eou__ I'm afraid that I don't have a credit history . I just came to this country . __eou__ Do you have an account with this bank ? __eou__ I'm afraid not . __eou__ In that case I highly recommend you apply for a savings and checking account also . That would help with your credit card application . __eou__ What is the interest rate on your card ? __eou__ The annual charge rate is 9.5 % . __eou__ That's very expensive ! __eou__ Not really . The credit card is a revolving account . You only pay interest on what you owe . __eou__ How does the bank bill its customers for credit card charges ? __eou__ You will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized . __eou__ Does the card provide any other benefits ? __eou__ You can also get a cash advance up to 1,000 dollars on this card . __eou__
Are utilities included in the rent ? __eou__ Gas and water are included . __eou__ Do I have to pay for electricity myself ? __eou__ Yes , electricity is not included in the rent . __eou__
What's happening , officer ? __eou__ There is a fire in your building . You need to evacuate immediately . __eou__ What ? A fire ? Oh , my God ! What shall I do ? Please get me out of here ! __eou__ Don't panic ! We'll help you get out of the building safely . __eou__ I can smell smoke ! __eou__ Please follow my instructions . Use a wet towel to cover your mouth and nose . Walk quietly to th nearest emergency exit . Now go get the wet towel . __eou__ OK . __eou__ Come with me . __eou__ Sir , I need to go back to get my jewelry box . __eou__ Don't take your personal belongings . We need to get out of the building now ! __eou__ Gosh ! I can see the flames ! __eou__ Crouch down and try not to breathe in the smoke . __eou__
So tell me , what's the difference between the Board of Directors , the CEO , and the stockholders ? They all seems ot be the same group of people to me ... __eou__ No , there's a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . Then there's the CEO — the chief executive officer . He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased . __eou__ How many people are on the board of directors ? __eou__ Usually not more than 15 , not less than 10 . They meet monthly , quarterly , or biannually to oversee an organization or company . They provide long term planing and vision , and also act as moral watchdogs rto keep the company in line . __eou__
Where do you spend the weekend ? __eou__ We've a country house . __eou__ That's nice . __eou__ Join us , will you ? __eou__ That'd be great ! Thank you . __eou__

As an international enterprise , it produces high quality household appliances . __eou__ Is there a warranty ? __eou__ Yes , all their products have warranties . __eou__ How long is it ? __eou__ The fridges is covered by a one-year warranty . __eou__ Which model is the best seller of this year ? __eou__ This one . How do you like it ? __eou__ It's too big for me . Could you recommend something else ? __eou__ Sure , this way please . __eou__
Is your application successful ? __eou__ Yes , they notify me to work next week . __eou__ Where on earth will you work in ? __eou__ It is a pretty big mechanical company . I am assigned to work in the assembly shop . __eou__ How long will you work a day ? __eou__ My working hours aren ’ t fixed , sometimes I do the day shift , sometimes the night shift . In all , about 8 hours . __eou__ That ’ s rather hard . __eou__ But it matches my major . __eou__ How will you get your pay ? __eou__ My wage depends on production results . __eou__ What sort of welfare facilities does your company provide ? __eou__ The company provides labor insurance for all employees , as well as fine retirement policy . __eou__ Is there a union ? __eou__ There is the company union , but it really shares the same aims as the management . __eou__ So you must consider dearly before you go to work . __eou__ I will . __eou__
Hello Mr Janus . What can we do for you today ? __eou__ Hello , Miao Ping . It's that time again ; I want to convert my salary . You know , it's so annoying . I wish my company could just pay me in RIB . __eou__ Haha ! I actually think that many locals would disagree with you ; they are all dying to be paid in US dollars . __eou__ Yes , I guess you are right . So , do you need my passport ? __eou__ Thanks , Mr Janus . Of course I trust you , but regulations are regulations . __eou__ Here you go . __eou__ Thanks . And of course , could you fill in the exchange form ? __eou__
That ’ s really a let-down . __eou__ Yeah . He really does let me down . __eou__ But that should not be the reason for you to lose heart . __eou__ I ’ m at the end of tether . I run out of ideas . __eou__
Would you please recommend some Chinese wine ? __eou__ Would you like to have a taste of Moutan ? __eou__ That's great ! What comes along with Moutan ? __eou__ Yes , you con order some typical Chinese dishes . For example , Roast Beijing Duck . __eou__ It sounds good . __eou__ Yes , it is the best of our hotel . __eou__ Really ? Let me have a try . __eou__ Thank you . Just a moment , please . __eou__
Wow , it has a balcony . __eou__ Yeah . Complete with nice of you . __eou__ How many windows are there in the apartment ? __eou__ Mm , let me see . I think there are 2 in the bedroom , and 1 each in the living room and kitchen . __eou__ It ’ s just what I want . I think I am ready to sign . __eou__ I call the landlord right now . __eou__ Before you send the lease , do you have any questions ? __eou__ Yes , does the renting include utilities ? __eou__ It includes everything except cable TV , and telephone . __eou__ How much is the cable ? __eou__ It usually comes out about $ 40 a month . __eou__ Also , are they allowing the apartment ? __eou__ No , I am afraid the apartment isn ’ t permitted . __eou__ I see . Do you love pets ? __eou__ Sorry , that ’ s out of question . I don ’ t have a problem with it . But , unfortunately , the building doesn ’ t allow it . It ’ s a building regulation . __eou__
I am having some plumbing problems and need them fixed . __eou__ What exactly is wrong with the plumbing ? __eou__ The toilet flushes really slowly . __eou__ Are there any problems with the plumbing in the kitchen ? __eou__ Both the kitchen and the bathroom plumbing are messed up . __eou__ How long have you had these problems ? __eou__ It has been going on for a while , but just started to get worse this morning . __eou__ I will send someone out to take a look at the problem . Will you be home this afternoon ? __eou__ Yes , I will be home this afternoon . __eou__ Fine . I will be there around two . If someone is not there , I will use my key to get in . __eou__
Hey , John ! What do you think are the main causes of war today ? __eou__ It's hard to say ! But it seems that a lot of wars nowadays are civil wars . People from different ethnic groups in the same country sometimes fight for power in that country . __eou__ Yeah , several of those civil wars have been going on for years and years . It seems they will never end . __eou__ How do you think they could be ended ? __eou__ I don't think that there is any easy way . __eou__ I think one better way to stop it is to cut off their financial support . __eou__ Yeah , you are right ! __eou__
Good evening , I'm so happy you could come . __eou__ Thank you for inviting me . __eou__ What would you like to drink ? __eou__ A glass of white wine would be fine , thank you . __eou__
The tea smells good . What tea is it ? __eou__ It's a special green tea named Longing Tea from Zhejiang province . __eou__ What's special about it except its pleasant smell ? __eou__ You can see that it keeps the original color of the tea leaves very well . __eou__ They must have some special methods to do this during the process . __eou__ Probably . I love green tea . It's one of my daily necessities . __eou__ Then , do you have “ tea time ” every day ? I mean , do you drink tea at a settled time ? __eou__ Not really . But I really love to have after-meal tea . __eou__ What's the advantage about tea ? __eou__ There are a lot of them . In hot or warm days , tea helps to dispel the heat and brings on an instant cool with a feeling of relaxation . Moreover , the tea leaves contain a number of chemicals which are good for people's health . __eou__ Does that mean the stronger the better ? __eou__ No . Constant drinking of over-strong tea would do harm to people's health . So don't make your tea too strong . __eou__ Got it . What's the proper time for tea ? __eou__ It's fine for most time of the day . But don't have tea before bedtime . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ It will give rise to occasional insomnia . OK , let's enjoy the tea before it gets cold . __eou__
hey , Maris , are you a part-timer ? __eou__ part-timer ? Is that a new buzzword ? __eou__ oh , it ’ s pretty popular among my classmates these days . So are you ? __eou__ sure , I have a part-time job as a bartender . __eou__ cool ! It must be amazing to work at a bar ! __eou__ yeah , but I ’ m not there for fun . I have to remain professional and if I get distracted , the manager would be pretty upset . __eou__ that ’ s true . I ’ m wondering did you learn anything from the job ? __eou__ of course . There ’ s always much to learn . I got to know more about the real world . __eou__ you mean you got working experience , right ? __eou__ not just working experience . I would say the biggest lesson I learned is how to deal with people from all walks of life . __eou__ it must be very demanding . __eou__ sometimes it is . But after working for a few weeks , it ’ s easy to figure out . __eou__ really ? It sounds interesting . __eou__ maybe you can come to the bar one day and I ’ ll show you around . __eou__ great . I ’ m looking forward to it . __eou__
I'm going for a walk , Yi-jun . I need some time to myself . __eou__ Don't you want to go to the visiting hours ? This sheet says they are tonight . __eou__ I just can't right now . Everyone will be talking about Taylor and ... __eou__ ... and maybe that's what we both need . __eou__ I need to come to grips with his death first . And I also need to prepare a eulogy in case I'm asked to speak tomorrow . __eou__ OK , but don't forget I'm here for you , and I know how you feel . It's my loss , too . __eou__
I will take it . How much ? __eou__ $ 60 . __eou__ I am sure you can do better than that . __eou__ Sorry , sir . It's the sale price . __eou__ Well , what about $ 70 with a scarf ? __eou__ It's my rock bottom price . Take it or leave it . __eou__

He was taken to the hospital in an ambulance . __eou__ How did it happen ? __eou__ His car was hit by an express train . It happened at the crossing just behind his house . __eou__ How horrible ! __eou__ He ’ s having an operation in the hospital now . Poor Hilda !

Mr Moon , how good to see you again . __eou__ Hello , Miao Ping , I'm here to chat with you about Corporate Agreement Savings . What can you tell me ? __eou__ Well , Corporate Agreement Savings will be based on the Agreement Deposit Contract signed by the customer and the bank together . So , this contract decides the terms and the line of basic deposit withheld while settling the account . So , if we look within the line of basic deposit , the interest should be counted at the rate of Current Deposit on the day of settlement or withdrawal . __eou__ What if I exceed ? __eou__ If it goes beyond the basic deposit , the agreement will be settled at the rate agreement savings which has been determined by the People's Bank of China on the day you wish to settle or withdraw . __eou__ Right , I see . It all sounds pretty complicated to me . I think I'm going to need some more time to think about this and make a decision as to what I want to do . __eou__
When shooting a gun , accuracy is very important . __eou__ You only need to tell me that once . __eou__
You seem to be upset . What ’ s eating you ? __eou__ It ’ s because of my son . Dick keeps getting on my nerves __eou__ Dick ? How come ? He used to be as meek as a lamb . __eou__ Yes , he used to be . But now he ’ s drifting off track . __eou__ He must have been in bad company , or he wouldn ’ t be off the beans . __eou__
Hi Linda , this is Todd . __eou__ Todd , good to hear from you ! __eou__ I just wanted to tell you what a great time I had with you at the movies last week . __eou__ Me too , Todd ! Thanks for suggesting that great movie . __eou__ I also enjoyed it and was wondering if you would like to go for a hike in the mountains with me on Saturday . __eou__ I would love to join you on a hike . Could I maybe bring a picnic lunch for us to eat on the trail ? __eou__ Sure Linda , that's a great suggestion . __eou__ Fine then , what time are we going to leave ? __eou__ I was thinking maybe 9 o'clock or so , so that we could get started before the heat gets too bad . __eou__ Nine would be perfect . I'll see you then ! __eou__
Why'd you pull me over ? __eou__ Are you aware that you drove through a red light ? __eou__ I ran a red light ? __eou__ Yes , you did . __eou__ I apologize , but I didn't realize that I did . __eou__ Weren't you taught that yellow means slow down , not speed up ? __eou__ I did learn that . __eou__ So , then why did you speed up ? __eou__ I don't know what to tell you . __eou__ I'm going to have to write you a ticket . __eou__ I understand . __eou__ Here you go . Don't do that again . __eou__
How much do I have to pay ? __eou__ $ 70 , madam . __eou__ Here you are . Can you put the bread in a separate bag ? __eou__ OK , here is your change . __eou__
Don't I know you ? __eou__ I'm not sure.You look familiar . __eou__ You're Mr.Stevenson , right ? __eou__ Yes.And you're Mr.Jones , I remember . __eou__
That was a beautiful car . It ’ s a new car , but it ’ s totaled . __eou__ Well , your insurance covers sufficient money to replace it . So you don ’ t need to worry . __eou__ I don ’ t think I could afford that kind of car again . I think I ’ ll have to choose something that is not as hard to replace . __eou__ Since you are not the one who caused the accident , your insurance cost should be the same . __eou__ What will happen if I chose a smaller car ? Would the payments be the same ? __eou__ If you got a smaller car , the cost should be a little less depending on the model , age , and size . Would you still want full coverage ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__
Sir , here is your curried beef . __eou__ Well . I am afraid you have made a mistake . It's not the dish I ordered . __eou__ Let me see , I am sorry . It's for table 11 . __eou__ It doesn't matter . __eou__
Hi , what're you reading ? __eou__ An old book Death on the Nile.Have you read it ? __eou__ Not yet , but I saw the movie.Could I borrow it when you finish reading ? __eou__ Sure.But you need to be patient . __eou__
Have you brought the receipt with you ? __eou__ No , I don't . I left it home . __eou__ Sorry , but we can't do anything without the receipt . Come back with it . __eou__ I didn't know . I'll go to get it . How late will you be open ? __eou__ Till 5:30 . __eou__
Hi , Lucy , you are very popular with people around you , what are your tricks ? __eou__ Thank you for saying so . I don ’ t know , probably because I like sharing my experience and knowledge with them . I think this kind of communication helps to improve our work efficiency and also helps to get along with colleagues . __eou__ Sharing knowledge can be very settled and some second stances . People may think you are telling them how to do their work . If they take it personally , they feel angry at you and even become reluctant to support you at work . __eou__ That is true . Some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way . For example , it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people . To show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off . __eou__ You are quite right . Thank you for sharing your experience with me . I learned a lot . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . __eou__
Jill , how do you like your new job ? __eou__ I like it . But how did you know about my new job ? I wanted to surprise you . __eou__ I just heard through the grapevine something about you landing a job with some travel agency down town . You can still fill me in on tile details . __eou__ Well , two weeks ago I got a tip about a possible job opening at Ace Travel Agency over on Franklin Avenue . __eou__ Sure , I think I know the place . __eou__ Well , anyway , I made a beeline over to their office , had an interview with the manager , and was told to start work the next day . __eou__ That ’ s really great , jill . So , what do you do there exactly ? __eou__ Right now I ’ m basically just a secretary , but if I ’ m given the chance , I want to become a travel agent there . __eou__ Don ’ t tell me your ’ re already bucking for a promotion . __eou__ No , of course not . I ’ Ve got a lot to learn yet . In the meantime , I just want to be a good secretary and not step on anyone ’ s toes . __eou__ Well I wish you luck . __eou__
Morning . May I help you ? __eou__ Yes . I'd like to open an account that enables me to draw money easily . __eou__ Well , in that case , I think a checking account may be more convenient for you . However , there's a service charge . __eou__ How much is the service charge ? __eou__ One percent . __eou__ Sounds reasonable . Will 300 dollars be enough for a minimal deposit ? __eou__ More than enough . Please fill in this form . __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ Your passport , please . __eou__
Excuse me , I want to know the price of your CPU . __eou__ Glad to tell you . The price of CPU is 300 dollars . __eou__ It's rather too high . If you can make it cheaper , we will be able to place large orders continuously . __eou__ If you order a large amount , we can give you a discount . __eou__ Well , can you explain it to me ? __eou__ The price of CPU is 260 dollars above 1,000 Units . __eou__ Can you reduce more ? __eou__ I'm sorry , but to be frank , considering exploiting the market in your country , we have already supplied you at very low preferential price . __eou__ In that case , we have to stop ordering if a reduction can't be made . Please reconsider . __eou__ It is so hard to deal with . __eou__ If you can give us a more reduction , We'd be able to give you an order on the spot . __eou__ This price is the best we can make . __eou__
What's the matter with you ? You look so upset and tired . __eou__ My father failed in business . __eou__ Oh , that's really tough . __eou__ Maybe it is the most difficult period of my family have experienced . __eou__ I can understand . By the way , is there anyway I can help ? __eou__ No , not now . I have found a part-time job.So perhaps I can help my family to come over the difficulties . __eou__ Oh , that's so great , bless you ! if you need me , I'll always be there . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
OK ! Let's get down to business now . __eou__ Say it . __eou__ As you know , we should work out cautious and detailed plan for our promotion , so as to guide our company to be successful in the new product , L-series . __eou__ That's right . And in my opinion , to push the sale of the new products is not an easy task . __eou__ I know that . I need to discuss this with Arden . And in his opinion , we should widen the scope of our ads , so newspaper and Internet should be adopted in this campaign . __eou__ Could you put it in detail ? __eou__ Well . We plan to contact www . on-line advertising . com.cn and Shanghai Morning Newspaper to discuss the advertisement schedule . __eou__ I think the idea is very good . In the promotion campaign , two or more media are used together , so as to draw customers ' attention and keep hold their attention to larger extent . __eou__ What kind of media do you recommend ? __eou__ I think TV is also an effective media , as long as our company is willing to spend more money on it . __eou__ Well . Arden just mentioned the paper and the on-sales . And I can talk about TV with him later , because TV promotion gets more and more popular among consumers . __eou__ I also think good advertising is essential to call attention to a product and introduce our L-series products . Meanwhile , ads are also the representation of the company's image . __eou__
I feel so uncomfortable . __eou__ Are you sick ? __eou__ No . The teacher is dragging the chalk over the blackboard . It set my teeth on edge . __eou__ He ’ ll finish writing in a minute . __eou__
Hi , John , this is Mary , your tenant up in Lincoln Park . __eou__ Oh , hi , Mary , what can I do for you ? __eou__ I was wondering when trash collection day was . __eou__ It ’ s on Tuesdays and Fridays . __eou__ Great . __eou__ You could save a couple of dollars by taking it to the dump yourself , though . __eou__ Oh , o . k . Where ’ s that ? __eou__ It ’ s at the corner of that street . __eou__ Thanks . Who do I call for trash collection ? __eou__ Just leave the stuff by the curb .

But the other candidate has several years of related experiences . __eou__ Maybe that is true . But I am a fast learner and I am willing to work overtime , and I do not mind a lot of business travel . __eou__ We surely believe you . __eou__ Can't you give me another chance and reconsider your decision ? __eou__ I am afraid we are sticking to our choice . __eou__ Possibly you are now .

You need to take it four times a day for three days straight . __eou__
This is going to surprise you , but I'm happy . I think you're making the right move . __eou__ You do ? __eou__ Look , maybe I shouldn't tell you this , but I'v going over to WebTracker , too . __eou__ No way ! That's great ! Then we'll still be together ! __eou__ Actually , I'm already working for WebTracker . Vince never wanted to give me what I was worth , so I figured , what the heck . __eou__ No kidding ! I can't believe this . You devil ! __eou__ It's kind of cool , isn't it ? I'm sort of like a secret agent . __eou__

Hey , Shirley ! Want to join me for lunch ... my treat ! __eou__ Wow ! Sure ! __eou__ I must confess I have an ulterior motive for asking you to lunch . __eou__ Oh ... that's OK ... as long as you're buying ! __eou__ I really want to pick your brain about something I've been thinking a lot about . __eou__ I'd love to help if I can . __eou__ Well , as you know , I have a Bachelor's degree in English literature and that's served me well so far , but I've always wanted to do some post-graduate work ... maybe even get a Doctorate ! __eou__ Wow ! Just the idea of going back to school fills my head with pain . __eou__ But you have a Master's degree ... hasn't that helped your career ? __eou__ Yeah , I'd have to say it has . But I'm still paying for it , you know . __eou__ I know education is expensive , but it's been my lifelong dream . Call me crazy , but I've always wanted to have that PhD at the end of my name . __eou__ Well , getting a Doctorate degree would mean close to a decade of school . Can you afford that ? Can you survive that ? __eou__ I certainly can't afford it , but I'm sure I could find some good student loans . __eou__ I think you need to separate the dream of having a PhD from the reality of years of more schooling . It's not as romantic as you might think . __eou__ Yeah ... I keep thinking about what I'll do with a Master's or Doctorate . I love language but I don't think there are a lot of well-paying jobs out there for experts on Shakespeare . __eou__ Uh huh , that's for sure . You might find that your only career choice is teaching other graduate students . __eou__
Dad , I'm scared . __eou__ Take it easy , honey . It's just raining cats and dogs . __eou__ But , dad , it's stormy outside . __eou__ Honey , it's just windy and raining outside . __eou__ Ar ! Dad , the power went out . __eou__

I feel overwhelmed by the daily work . Sometimes , I just can ’ t focus on what I am doing . What is worse , though I make plans for a whole week , I always have to make changes later on because other things come up . I can ’ t manage my time well . I can ’ t handle work well . I am afraid I was screw up more things . __eou__ Look , Lucy . Things are not so bad as you said . This is our company ’ s busiest time in a year . You need to relax a little . Don ’ t push yourself too hard , ok ? __eou__ Well , I will try . __eou__
It's time to leave the office for the night . Firstly I log off my computer , then I set the electronic security system . __eou__ That's pretty advanced . __eou__ Now I'll quickly send a short message to my wife and take the elevator down to the basement . __eou__ Is that where you park ? __eou__ Yes , the car park is under constant video surveillance , so my car is quite safe . Please get in . __eou__ Thank you . Where is your key ? __eou__ There's no need , I have keyless entry , and the steering wheel recognizes my finger prints before starting the car . Now , we can look at the navigation system to find the best route home . __eou__ That's amazing , it even shows all the roads that are congested at the moment . __eou__ Using GPS I can rely on this to direct me home . Now I just need to find my E-Card to automatically open the gate and we can drive out . __eou__ Pretty soon cars will be driving themselves . __eou__ Maybe , but in the meantime why not help me find the remote control for my garage door ? __eou__ Here it is , and here we are . __eou__ When I turn off my home alarm , the house will automatically tum on the lights and set the climate to a comfortable level . __eou__ I have to get home , but I don't need all of this fancy technology , I think I'll just walk . __eou__
Be careful . The floor is wet . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ I spilled my drink . __eou__
Hello again . Have you come to a decision ? __eou__ I'm still not sure about these ' Visible ' Certificates .

Also , they can be cashed in advance , before the maturity is up . __eou__ Right . How about the Bearer Certificates ? Can they be cashed before the maturity date ? __eou__ Unfortunately , not . You see , because they are not registered , they can be bought and sold by anyone . They also can be cashed on maturity in any nationwide financial institution . __eou__ So , if I was strapped for cash , I could transfer it to get some money ? __eou__ Technically , yes . __eou__ OK , I think I've got it . __eou__
Yes ! I finally lost that last five pounds I've been working on forever ! __eou__ How did you finally do it ? __eou__ A friend suggested that I stop nibbling between meals . __eou__ Like snacking ? __eou__ You know , a little piece of chocolate here , some chips on the side , candy now and then ... __eou__ I get what you mean . __eou__ Instead , I sit down and have a good snack like a piece of fruit between meals . __eou__ I'm impressed . Good for you ! __eou__

Now , this is how you make the settings for the treadmill ... __eou__

What ’ s the difference between football and rugby ? __eou__ Those tow games are quite different . First , there ’ s the size of the teams . In football , a team has 11 players . In rugby there are 15 players on each team . The biggest difference is that in football , only the goalkeeper can use his hands . In rugby , the ball is usually carried forward by players , though kicking is permitted . __eou__ In rugby , players pass the ball by throwing it to team mates , don ’ t they ? __eou__ That ’ s right . However , players can only pass the ball backwards . They cannot pass the ball forwards to their team mates . That ’ s a foul . __eou__ I know how goals are scored in football , but how about in rugby ? __eou__ If a team carries the ball over the goal line , they score points . A team can also score points by kicking the ball between two tall posts at each end of the pitch . __eou__ There ’ s a lot more physical contact in rugby , isn ’ t there ? __eou__ Yes . Players usually need to bring a player down to stop him from moving forward with the ball . This is called ” tackling ” , as in football . __eou__ The ball is a different shape in rugby , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Yes . It ’ s not perfectly round like a football . A rugby ball is oval in shape . There ’ s a match on TV this afternoon . Why don ’ t you watch it with me ? I ’ ll try to explain the rules and tactics while we ’ re watching . __eou__ Ok . __eou__
