I heard that Jim lost 100 yuan . Do you know that ? __eou__ I don't know . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ But some classmates said you took the money . __eou__ It is not true . __eou__ Look at my eyes . __eou__ Well , I confess . I did it , because I urgently need money to buy some medicine for my mother for she is badly ill . I'm ashamed that I did that . __eou__ Return the money to Jim and make an apology . I think he will forgive you . __eou__ I will . __eou__
What do you think of the new television channel ? Aren't the programs awful ? __eou__ I quite agree with you . They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me . __eou__ Actually , what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you more . There aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done . __eou__ You are absolutely right . They are too brief . They don't tell you anything . __eou__
And lightweight , too . It'll play for 20 hours on two AA batteries ! __eou__ Cool ! The sound is great . These earphones are awesome ! __eou__ And they're really safe . They'll protect your ear from sound damage . __eou__ You certainly need that . You always pump the volume up way too high . __eou__ I know . And you can also hear outside noises while you listen to music . __eou__ You're right ! So I can listen to music while riding my motorbike ! __eou__
Hi Joe . You've met my new assistant , right ? __eou__ Emm ... yes . But I wasn't too impressed . I found her a little stuck up . __eou__ You are kidding , but she's so helpful . __eou__ Tom ... you are her boss , you down . Of course , she's helpful to you . __eou__ Come on . She's like that with everyone . __eou__ I don't think so actually . She never even says " hello " to me . __eou__
Are you a soccer fan ? __eou__ Yes , I am . I like to watch soccer games on TV , but I don ’ t play . I watched every game of the 2002 World Cup . __eou__ Which team is your favorite ? __eou__ Italian . They played very well , but they were not very lucky . __eou__ I like the Brazilians . They are the real champions . __eou__
Look at this headline , Soo Mi . __eou__ Wow ! So many people in the United States get divorced ! __eou__ Is it the same in Korea ? __eou__ I don't think so . In Korea some marriages break up , but most couples stay together . __eou__ Do people get married young ? __eou__ Not really . Very few people get married beforethe age of 20 . __eou__ Hmm . Do women usually work after they get married ? __eou__ No , a lot of women stay home and take care of their families . But some work . __eou__
Even if our company didn't have a dress code , I still think people would wear formal clothing to work . __eou__ I wouldn't be so sure ... People want to wear what they feel most comfortable in . __eou__ Maybe that's true for some positions , but I think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree . They dress for success ! You can't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans . It's just not respectful to you client . __eou__ I think what you wear is so overrated . I would rather have a down-to-earth , honest and solid sales person than a painted , patent leather , designer suite salesman . __eou__ It's not as simple as that . People judge you by your appearance , whether you like it or not . So dressing professional is being professional . The image that you portray to others is so important in business . It's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale . __eou__ Maybe you're right , but I'll take my sneakers and jeans any day ! __eou__
What did you learn at the workshop you went to yesterday ? Do you think it was worth the investment to go ? __eou__ Yeah , I really got a lot of the session . The workshop topic was resolving personal problems . It was led by a professional human resources director . The teacher had a lot of experience , and I think we were all given a really good base to start with . __eou__ The workshop was only one afternoon long , do you really think you can learn that much in only a couple of hours ? __eou__ It depends on the topic , the teacher , and the way the course is set up . Yesterday , even though we only had a short time to discuss the issues , the workshop got us all thinking . We learned some very basic , but very useful methods of dealing with personnel issues . __eou__ Sounds like you really learned a lot . __eou__ I did ... I just hope I can implement all these great ideas that we shared . __eou__
My Buddha ! ! It's beautiful ! But I thought you were afraid ? __eou__ Actually , I was watching your auction all along . I saw you drop out at $ 250 . __eou__ You sneak ! __eou__ I watched Buddha buyer go up to $ 315 . I waited until the very last minute and then I jumped in at $ 325 ! I sniped him ! __eou__ But that's a lot of money ! Honey ! __eou__
Excuse me , what's the checking time for flight FA1187 ? __eou__ Have you paid the airport fee ? __eou__ Yes , and I have already gone through the safety inspection . __eou__ In that case , please get your passport and boarding card ready . Just wait in the terminal for twenty more minutes.You will hear the announcement . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__

Did you hear about car accident on Spring Road yesterday ? __eou__ Yes , I did . I heard that they took both drivers to hospital . One needed surgery . __eou__ Yes . I heard he had a few broken bones too , but that the doctors have set the fractures without any problems . __eou__ The second driver was luckier . He had a concussion and needed some stitches for his head wound . __eou__ Yes . He was released from hospital yesterday evening . The other man could be there for weeks . __eou__ I understand that he ’ s connected to a heart monitor and breathing apparatus . His condition can ’ t be very good . __eou__ The hospital announced this morning that his condition is poor but stable . What does that mean ? __eou__ It means he ’ s really badly injured , but he will almost certainly survive . __eou__ His family will be pleased to hear that . They must have been so worried . __eou__

Welcome to our show ! Today , I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich ! Are you ready ? Let ’ s get started ! __eou__ Let ’ s start with the basics , bread . Bread is an important ingredient here . You need to remember one thing - choose the bread according to the following criteria , freshness , crumb and color . If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven , or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color . __eou__ Now that our bread is ready , let ’ s talk about the ingredients ! Of course , each person ’ s palate is different , but I ’ m going to give you a few tips that you ’ ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich . I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich . __eou__ Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light . The best choices here are evident — cucumbers , tomatoes , onions , sweet pepper or chilli , lettuce and , of course , herbs — you can ’ t go wrong with them . As for aubergines , mushrooms and asparagus , I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil . __eou__ Last but not least , we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich . We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper , or we can combine mustard sauce , mayonnaise , ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor ! It ’ s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt ! __eou__ That ’ s all the time we have for today , but join us next time where we ’ ll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna ! Till next time ! __eou__
Well , it's illegal to bring food and drinks into the theater . __eou__ Too bad . I did anyway . __eou__ No wonder you brought such a big bag today . __eou__ I brought Strawberry Sticks . See ? __eou__ Those are the ones that are pre-dipped in sweet coating ! __eou__ Yep . And there's real strawberry chunks in the coating . __eou__
I wonder if I can see your mother , little boy . Is she engaged ? __eou__ Engaged ? She ’ s married . __eou__ Johnny , I wish you ’ d stop reaching for things . Haven ’ t you a tongue ? __eou__ Yes , Mother , but my arm is longer . __eou__
Hi , Bill . Are you going to the commencement ? __eou__ Yes . Do you want to go with me ? __eou__ OK . ( Several minutes later . ) Let's go into the school auditorium . __eou__ Now that take this seat . Do you see those piles of red diplomas on the desks on the stage ? __eou__ Yes . I find my heart is now rising and falling like waves , all sorts of feelings welling up in my heart . __eou__ That's true . Four years ' trails and hardships , joys and sorrows of life are gushing out to my mind all together . I can hardly tell whether I am joyful or gloomy at the moment when I am about to leave the campus and to start a new stage of my life . __eou__ How time flies . Look , the president of the college has come onto the stage . __eou__ He's going to make the opening speech . __eou__
Hi ! Dick . Where are you going ? You're in such a hurry . __eou__ Playground . We're having sports for today's outside class activities . All my classmates have already got there . __eou__ What are you going to play ? __eou__ Some of us will play basketball and some volleyball . __eou__ Enjoy yourself . __eou__
Are you still busy today ? __eou__ It seems to be . How about you today ? __eou__ Fine , honey . Rome couldn't be built with in one day . __eou__ OK , I'll find the time to relax soon . __eou__ Take care , honey . I am always expecting you . __eou__
Did you see May today ? __eou__ Yes , but why does she have such a long face ? __eou__ I don't have the foggiest idea . __eou__ I thought she'd be happy . __eou__ Yeah , especially since she got a promotion recently . __eou__ I don't know . Maybe it ’ s some kind of personal problem . __eou__
What did the doctor say ? __eou__ He said that I have been eating too much . __eou__ Did he give you any advice ? __eou__ Yes , he asked me to clean up my diet by cutting red meat . __eou__ Yes , you must put yourself on a diet . __eou__
What places does the tour include ? __eou__ You will visit the Hyde Park , Poet's Corner , Tower of London , Fleet Street and Tower Bridge . __eou__ So many places I have been looking forward to . We will take part in the group . __eou__ I think you will enjoy your journey . __eou__
You look bright-eyed and bushy-tailed . __eou__ Of course , just five minutes ago I got the phone call from Future Clothes Company and I was told to start my trial period in that company next Monday . __eou__ Congratulations ! Let's get together sometime . __eou__ Great idea . __eou__ Well , I am worried to death right now ! There is still no news from the company for me . __eou__ Let it be ! Time will tell . __eou__ Maybe they will send me e-mail to inform the result . Let me check my mail-box again . __eou__
Now that you have learned Kung fu for a few months , what are your general impression of it ? __eou__ I think , maybe , it takes a real Kung fu master to give a more fair assessment ; meanwhile , I am no more than a beginner . But I really doubt whether kung fu would be of any great help when it comes to defending oneself in real life . __eou__ You mean , kung fu may not be so powerful as it is imagined ? To some extent your idea holds water . Kung fu was originally intended for self-defense , but with time it became something more than defense skills . Now we are apt to treat it as an art . __eou__ An art ! You have a good point there . So it is called martial arts in English . The Chinese are really capable of doing things nicely . They even made fighting a great enjoyment , so marvelous and fascinating . __eou__ Thanks for your compliment ! Perhaps the Chinese culture as a whole has a special inclination towards aesthetics . Do you know Jin Yong ? __eou__ I know he is a martial arts fiction writer . But I've read none of his novels . __eou__ All of his works have been translated into English . I recommend you to read one or two works of his . You'll get a general glimpse into Chinese kung fu culture . When you go through the pages , you are likely to feel they are not about kung fu alone , but cover all walks of life . __eou__ I see . They must have incorporated a series of Chinese cultural elements . __eou__ Yes , take philosophy , for instance . What makes a true , respectable da via , or a warrior hero ? It's not enough only to be formidable . It also involves a man's character , sense of justice , and values of life . __eou__ So kung fu is also a means of self-cultivation , isn't it ? __eou__ Indeed , you're exactly right ! __eou__
Thank you for coming tonight , Mrs . Webber . As a teacher , it's great seeing the kid's parents assist our parent-teacher conference night . __eou__ Of course ! I am very interested to know how my child is doing and also get some insight from you as to how he can improve . __eou__ Well Allen is a great student . He is a hard worker and very well behaved , however he does struggle a bit with math . __eou__ I guess he gets that from me , I never did well in math when I was a kid . What can I do at home to compliment what he is learning in the classroom . __eou__ Well , it's important that you sit with him and review his homework assignments and help him with math . I would also recommend he stay after school twice a week for tutoring sessions . It will really help a lot . __eou__ Thanks a lot ! I will definitely do that . Is there anything else ? __eou__ Um ... yes . Here is a notice from our financial department , seems your child's Tumion is overdue . __eou__ Oh yes , I ... __eou__
I hear Yolanda has been studying every night this week for the exam . __eou__ That's good , but I think it's too late . She hasn't studied all semester , and I doubt she can catch up in one week . __eou__
I am so bored all day . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Jack borrowed a large sum of money from me and didn ’ t pay me back . __eou__ Don ’ t make a mountain out of molehill . I am sure he will do that on his payday . __eou__
Hey , Bob . Are you getting the feeling you've been here before ? __eou__ Yes , I'm sure I've been here before . __eou__ Maybe we're walking in circles . __eou__ Yes , there's that bar we passed an hour ago . __eou__
You always stick to your PC recently . Are you still fascinated by chatting on line ? __eou__ For me , the times of chatting online has gone . __eou__ What the hell are you doing now ? __eou__ I opened my blog today . In order to have more visitors , I have to land on others ' blogs and leave my messages for their blogs . __eou__ What's new with you ? __eou__ Do you still remember Justin ? __eou__ Of course , he was our monitor in college . How is him now ? __eou__ He seemed to be dumped by his girlfriend . I found his blogs were a little sad . __eou__ Let me see . What a moving poem ! __eou__
What colour is her hair ? __eou__ Oh , blonde , she's very blonde ... quite short hair ... __eou__ What , curly ? __eou__ No , not at all . Very straight . Her hair comes down like this ... just over the ears . __eou__ Does she wear glasses ? __eou__ No ... no . I think you're thinking of someone else . __eou__ No . I'm sure I know her . __eou__ Er ... what else can I tell you ? Er ... she's got ... er a ... round face , a very round face , and a very big mouth , sort of wide mouth , when she laughs , her face is all mouth . __eou__ Ah ... No , I can't place her . __eou__
I cannot ignore her suggestion . In fact I always value her suggestion . __eou__ I know . Maybe you will get the air if you go against her . __eou__ Well , it takes two to to make a happy marriage . __eou__ And it takes two to make an agreement too . You have no guts , I am afraid . __eou__
She has contributed to a new school . __eou__ Oh , I know . She is a famous woman and a focus of the newspaper now because of this thing . __eou__ I hear the school is very modern . It has the best equipments . __eou__ Yes . Do you know its name . __eou__ She said she would name it after her father . __eou__ Oh , I think she wants to do this thing in memory of her father . __eou__
Sandra is actually blue chipper . I don't think she could realize that she has married a fool for women . __eou__ That's fate . __eou__ I feel sorry for her . __eou__ Maybe this is God's will . __eou__
We can go to the cinema or say at home watching TV , what's it to be ? __eou__ As far as I'm concerned , staying at home is more comfortable than going to the movies . __eou__ Thanks , dear . I feel so tired after a whole day's work . __eou__
I heard that James was fired because he got a keep back of 20 thousands dollars from a vender . __eou__ That ’ s open secret . __eou__ But mine could be a lie for his job . __eou__ How did you know that ? __eou__ A little bird whispered to me . Keep that to yourself . __eou__
Mom ? __eou__ Mm ? __eou__ Can my friend , Tom Mitchum , come home with me for lunch tomorrow ? __eou__ Of course , Jim . Have I met Tom before ? __eou__ Mm — hmm . You met him last summer . He is small and very smart . __eou__ Oh , yes . I remember Tom . His family comes from Maine , right ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__
Recycling is big business these days , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it's definitely a growing business . __eou__ What do you recycle in your plant ? __eou__ Mainly plastics . Plastics aren ’ t bio degradable - they don ’ t break down easily in the environment - so they shouldn't be thrown away . __eou__ How is plastic recycled , then ? __eou__ Well , there are basically two methods . One is to break down the chemicals in the plastic into smaller chemical particles . These can then be used in the production of new chemicals . __eou__ Is that the method you use here ? __eou__ No , we don't do that here . We recycle polyethylene and we make it into other products . __eou__ How do you do that ? __eou__ By melting it down and then reforming it . Our main products are bin liners for kitchen bins and carrier bags for supermarkets . __eou__
I am looking for a comfortable convenient way to see the country . __eou__ Have you heard of motor coaching ? It's one of the fastest-growing segments for the travel industry . __eou__ No , I've not heard of it . Tell me about it . __eou__ It's almost like going on an ocean cruise except that you go by land . Everything is planned for you from the moment you step on board a luxury coach . __eou__ Is it just a bus ? __eou__ Oh . no . The motor coach is air-conditioned , there is a galley for food preparation , movies or music are available for your entertainment and attendants are there to take care of your every need . __eou__ Wow ! That sounds like pure luxury . __eou__
What price do you suggest for 300,000 sets of Article No . 2323 with London as the destination port ? __eou__ Let me see . It's £ 800 per set CIF London . __eou__ What commission terms can you offer ? __eou__ Usually the commission is three percent of the net invoice amount after deduction of discounts . __eou__ Couldn't you raise the commission to five percent ? __eou__ Considering our good relationship and our future business , we give you four percent . That's the best we can do . We can't go any further . What would you say to it ? __eou__ Then I'll accept it with thanks . __eou__
How are you doing ? Pretty good , I imagine ? __eou__ Actually not so good . That's why we made a special trip to see you . __eou__ OK , let me hear it . I'd be glad to help if I can . __eou__ Good . I want to discuss with you the mode of payment for the construction of the power plant under negotiation . __eou__ Well , I trust that your presence will hasten the settlement of payment terms . __eou__ I would like to explain to you our financial position . The manufacture of machinery and its accessories and parts will consume both time and money . It takes five years to manufacture the machinery and we will have to advance the cost for the main machines to be produced , and besides this there are large sums to be paid to our subcontractors for the manufacture of the accessories and parts . __eou__ But for an enterprise of your size , an order from us will certainly not embarrass you financially . __eou__ Well , in fact , it is beyond our financial capability . __eou__ In what way can we solve the problem ? __eou__ Have you considered the possibility of a buyer's credit ? __eou__ Yes . But the sum is large , it must be provided by a group of banks . __eou__ So , we propose your company apply to Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation for a long-term loan . Six months before each shipment , you through Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation open , in our favour , an irrevocable , dividable L / C which is to remain valid for two months . __eou__ Well , we accept your suggestion . __eou__
I went to visit a customer in IVS Company the other day . Their offices were very impressive , especially their company Logo which is all over the place . There are Logo models in metal , copper , clove , paper . They are even printed on the wall paper and the balls of the table-lights . It is really decorated identity . __eou__ It is just too much . Don ’ t you feel it is an exaggerating style to decorate offices in that way ? __eou__ Not at all ! I like the design so much . The designer must have thought really hard to come out with such a brilliant concept . __eou__ Well , I doubt that . __eou__
I am afraid the label is not quite suitable for this locality . Could you quote us for the order with neutral cases ? __eou__ I am afraid not . We usually design the label ourselves . You know we should be responsible for the brand labels of our goods . __eou__ In that case , we'd like you to make some changes in the labeling . __eou__ What are they ? __eou__ First , the languages on the label should be in both English and French . Second , the red color doesn't suit our national customs . Could you print the label in some light colors such as yellowish or bluish ? __eou__ That can be easily done . Is there anything else ? __eou__ The brand name and the nice artwork need not be changed , but the net weight must be placed on the lower part of the panel . __eou__ We'll get the factory to meet your requirements . __eou__ Thanks for your help . __eou__
Ahahah ! What is that thing on your couch ! It just moved ! __eou__ Did you think it wasn't real ? That's my pet lizard . __eou__ You have a pet lizard ? Somehow I never would have imagined that . __eou__ His name is Grunt . Come closer and I'll properly introduce you . __eou__ Does it bite or scratch ? __eou__ No , he's perfectly harmless . And he's not afraid of strangers either . Here , hold him . __eou__ Wow . He's heavy ! And his skin feels really cool . __eou__ Stick around and you'll get to know him better . He has a very unusual personality . __eou__
Did you already take the history exam ? __eou__ Yeah . It was hard . When do you take it ? __eou__ I take it tomorrow morning . There is so much material that I dont know what to emphasize on . What types of questions did you get ? __eou__ Mostly on the civil war . You should also study the impact Martin Luther King Jr . had on American society . __eou__ What about Abraham Lincoln ? Did you get any questions about him ? __eou__ I only had 1 question about him . But you might get more . I dont know if he will have the same exam or not . __eou__ Hopefully he will use the same exam , cause Im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war . It is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class . __eou__ If you cant study everything , then that is probably the best way to go . __eou__ Aright . Thanks for the info . I gotta go to the library now . __eou__ Good luck . __eou__ Thanks . See ya . __eou__
Excuse me , i am a new student here . Could you tell me where the English Department is ? __eou__ It is in that brand new , tall building over there . On the 9th floor . __eou__ Where is the school cafeteria ? __eou__ It is the basement of that red building in front of the tower with big bells . __eou__ Where is the Computer Center ? __eou__ The Computer Center is on the first floor of the library . __eou__ Where is the library ? __eou__ The library is next to the Adminstration Building . The Adminstration Building is over there near the school ’ s main entrance . There are school maps for free in the lobby of the Admin . __eou__ Thank you . I will go get one . __eou__ Sure . Glad to be of service . By the way , my name is Mike Sullivan . You will see me around a lot . I am running for President of the Student Government . __eou__ Well , hi ! My name is Eve Markowski . I am glad to meet you . With your friendly smile and helpful attitude . I am sure you will win . __eou__ Thanks you for the encouragement . __eou__ You are welcome . I ’ d better go . Goodbye . __eou__ Have a good day . Bye-Bye ! __eou__
Do you think you could keep the noise down ? __eou__ I'm sorry . Am I keeping you awake ? __eou__ Yes . And another thing , would you mind not making long distance calls ? __eou__ I'm sorry . I thought you wouldn't mind . __eou__
Hello , Jane ! __eou__ Hi , Tom . How have you been ? __eou__ Pretty good . Actually , I'm quite busy with work . By the way , say ' hello ' to your husband . __eou__
He is so kind . I couldn ’ t believe he murdered his wife . __eou__ Of course not . I believe he ’ s innocent . __eou__ I don ’ t understand . __eou__ He nursed a viper in his bosom . His best friend Tony foamed him in . Tony first seduced his wife and then trapped him . __eou__
Are you telling us a lie again ? __eou__ I will be hanged if I lying . __eou__ All right . But what was the trouble ? __eou__ My car run out of petrol . __eou__
I can look anybody in the face because I ’ Ve done nothing to make me feel guilty or something . __eou__ There are not so many people like you . __eou__ You are flattering me . __eou__
Lucy , what are your priorities when buying a car ? __eou__ I guess the first thing is the price , the second is the size , and of course the color will play a role too . But I have to be honest . It is our today ’ s responsibility to take care about our environment . Therefore , I will also pay attention to the fuel consumption of the car . You know , the rise in gasoline prices is huge . So I would rather to consider a smaller car with smaller engine . For which I can also save some tax . Last of the list , I also consider the safety . __eou__ What about the environmental factors ? __eou__ Well , I do prefer the lower emission cars as long as it doesn ’ t cost much . Some environmentally-friendly cars are really expensive . __eou__ Sure they are . Some hi-tech devices are built in to make sure they pollute less . Some of these green cars have not become standard . So the production costs are still high . But anyway , we should make efforts to start with . __eou__
You know what , last night I almost got hit by a vase falling from the third floor . __eou__ Oh , how dreadful ! I ’ m ever so sorry . __eou__ Luckily that was nothing serious . __eou__ Thank God ! __eou__
what did you do over the weekend ? __eou__ I went a global warming rally in London . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment . __eou__ do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ? __eou__ it might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening . __eou__ like what ? __eou__ well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start . __eou__ what else can we do to protect the environment ? __eou__ if you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy . __eou__ how about recycling ? Does that actually help ? __eou__ yes . You should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center . __eou__ what do you think is the biggest worry for our future ? __eou__ I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone . __eou__ I had no idea you were such as environmentalist before ! __eou__ to be honest , in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place , we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment . __eou__
What do you consider to be your strong points ? __eou__ I think I ’ m tough not only physically but mentally . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ I have been playing football since high school . At present , I ’ m a member of a community football club . __eou__ Really ? Are you still playing ? __eou__ Yes . I practice every weekend with my teammates . __eou__ I see . You must be tough . __eou__ I never get tired . I think this comes from practicing football . __eou__ What do you consider to be your weak points ? __eou__ Frankly speaking , I ’ m a typical Chinese workaholic . I don ’ t mind working late at night . Due to that , I tend to leave the office late . __eou__ What kind of people are you reluctant to work with ? __eou__ So far I haven ’ t met any particular kind . However , I may rule out those who prefer chatting to working . __eou__ Do you prefer to work alone or as part of a team ? __eou__ It depends on the type of work . Usually I prefer to work alone , because I ’ m self-motivated . But I can work either way . If necessary , I don ’ t hesitate to join the team . __eou__
How much do you have budgeted for our trip to Las Angeles ? __eou__ In total , it should be about $ 5,000 for the week conference . Would you like to see the breakdown ? __eou__ Yes , I want to know exactly where the money is going . Give me a detailed report . __eou__ First we have the airline tickets , which are $ 500 per person ; with four of us going , that's t $ 2,000 . For our accommodations , we're spending $ 80 a night , per room , for five days . That's another $ 800 . __eou__ Weren ’ t you able to find anything less expensive ? We're sharing rooms , right ? __eou__ I have two people to a room . The $ 80 room rate is the lowest I could find . With the conference going on that week , all the hotels have inflated their prices , they're making a killing . __eou__ So far we have $ 2,800 , what else ? __eou__ I have budget $ 25 per Peron per day for food expenses . That totals another $ 800 . And for other incidentals , like take fees , and tips , I have estimated about $ 400 . __eou__ Well , that's only $ 4000 . Didn't you tell me your budget was $ 5000 ? Where is the rest of the money ? __eou__ That's my buffer ... I wanted to leave a little room in the budget , just in case---it's better to be safe than sorry . __eou__
Professor , where's Canada ? __eou__ Canada is north of here . __eou__ Can you show me on the map ? __eou__ Sure . Look here . Canada is north of the United States . __eou__ Oh , I see . Where's Mexico ? __eou__ Mexico is south of the United States . __eou__ How about Connecticut ? Where's that ? __eou__ Connecticut is east of New York . __eou__ What state is west of Pennsylvania ? __eou__ Ohio . __eou__ OK , Where's Los Angeles ? __eou__ Los Angeles is in California . It's southeast of San Francisco . __eou__ Where's Boston . __eou__ Boston is in the northeast part of the country . __eou__ Where is Las Vegas ? __eou__ Las Vegas is in the southwest . __eou__
Do you have any particular hobbies , Tom ? __eou__ Oh , yes . I love playing badminton , table tennis and computer games . And playing the games has become my favorite . __eou__ I hear many teenagers will spend hours and hours sitting at computers . And they don't care about their own health at all . How about you ? __eou__ I'm no better than them . They say it's mindless to sit in front of a machine all the time , but I think it's stimulating . __eou__ You won't play online games full of violence , will you ? __eou__ Once in a while . __eou__ It's no good . And I think spending several hours each day playing computer games is a waste of time . You might as well do something healthy and meaningful . __eou__ I hope I can practice self-control again . __eou__
Come on , you must tell me everything about him . __eou__ Well , he's very tall and handsome . __eou__ Hmm ... __eou__ He has big blue eyes and long blonde hair . __eou__ Oh , how long ? __eou__ Down to his shoulders . It's beautiful , like gold . __eou__ OK . OK . You'd better tell me what he does . __eou__ He's a very creative painter . His paintings sell well . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ He's quite a patient teacher , too . __eou__ Fine . __eou__ You're going to like him . Everybody says he's a nice guy . __eou__
What upsets you ? __eou__ My parents called . As usual , they reminded me again that I should have a plan to marry by my late 20s.Easier set than done . Who should I marry ? I have no time to go on a date . __eou__ It is not your mother finding one for you ? __eou__ I will find one myself , of course . I ’ m a modern girl . __eou__ Perhaps you can try the three minutes date , the latest type . __eou__ You mean dozens of the opposite sex meet each other for three minutes in a dimly bar serving alcohol , I hate that idea . __eou__ No , there is an updated version , three minutes video date . I know an online dating website providing such service with a microphone and webcam , you can sigh for it . You can be face-to-face with a guy talking for maximum three minutes . __eou__ I don ’ t think it makes sense . Three minutes is such a short time . __eou__ I think you can find out if there is a possibility of romance within the first second of meeting someone , so-called love at first sight . __eou__ Anyway , I don ’ t want to post my face up for sale on the internet like that . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . There are many other options using the internet as dating methods . Some sites operate at international standard even have got certifications . __eou__ Of course , for these sites , you have to pay a membership fee . But all in all , it is more serious and professional . The chance of meeting a good and serious person who does not play games is higher . __eou__ I don ’ t want to post my personal information on the internet . I ’ m not knowing who is reading it . __eou__
How about your study at college ? __eou__ I was doing quite well at college . I completed my MBA degree in international trade with first-class honors . __eou__ Why did you select your college ? __eou__ I selected my college because it had an excellent academic reputation . __eou__ What do you like doing in your spare time ? __eou__ My favorite recreation is cooking . I learned to cook Chinese dishes and western style dishes as well . It keeps me busy and makes me happy . __eou__
Look , there's no way we can convince people they need fresh motor oil every morning . __eou__ No , but you can let them know that yours is the cream of the crop-the purest motor oil in the world . Careful , hold it by the java jacket . This coffee drink has half and half-what do you think ? __eou__ It tastes funny . Why can't people just stick to plain and simple coffee ? __eou__ That's just the point ! Purity is the essence of good coffee , right ? __eou__

Good luck . __eou__

This one for example , is a bi monthly publication with recipes from all over the world ! __eou__ Wow , that would be kind of useful , do you have any other cooking magazines ? __eou__ Sure do ! This one is a quarterly publication , but each issue has over 200 color pages of recipes and also many home decorating ideas ! __eou__ Wow , this is nice ! Ok , sign me up for both publications . __eou__ You mentioned you have a dog , most pet owners sign up for this weekly newsletter that has information on dog care , pet shops and even pet sitters ! __eou__ That is exactly what I needed ! What else do you have ? __eou__ Well , I also have ... __eou__
I ’ Ve always wondered , what ’ s the difference between English for Chinese students and English for native students ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . What do you think ? __eou__ I think a Chinese student concentrates on written English , and uses it as a basis for communicating . From start to finish he ’ s learning vocabulary and fundamentals of grammar . This is a very difficult way to learn . __eou__ What do natives get ? __eou__ They get higher level English , which is more formal than everyday spoken English . They also deal with matters of style and creativity . __eou__ Do you mean that a native doesn ’ t make any mistakes in grammar ? __eou__ Absolutely not ! Native speakers make a lot of grammar mistakes , especially if they come from a home where nonstandard English is spoken . __eou__ I suppose that only a small percentage of college students don ’ t know standard English in American universities . __eou__ Actually there are more non-native speakers than you think . That ’ s why it ’ s so important to quit worrying about making mistakes . Just talk to everyone every chance you get . __eou__

They are equally matched . __eou__ I am so nervous now . What a terrific game ! __eou__ Which side are you on ? __eou__ It's hard to say , because each team has my idols . __eou__ Wow ! AC wins . It is a close shave , you know . __eou__ I will never forget this match . The angle is so terrible and so correct . __eou__ What a good goal ! __eou__
Are you saying you saw an eagle ? There are no eagles here . __eou__ Yes , I saw one . Believe me . __eou__ You must have seen some other kind of bird . __eou__

Julia , I saw two men fighting beside our door this morning . __eou__ I know them . They are the two brothers living next door . __eou__ Brothers ?

Do you like watching the Winter Olympic Games ? __eou__ Of course . It's the tradition game in winter , and with good reason . Don't you like watching it ? __eou__ Of course I do . I love it . All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable . __eou__ That's true . For various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics . You know , the low temperature may cause many problems . __eou__ Yeah . What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics ? __eou__ When the Olympic Games started in modern times , only summer events were included . When it grew popular , there came the Winter Olympic Games , which includes a variety of winter sports . __eou__ I see . Then , what's your favorite winter sport ? __eou__ Figure skating . In my eye , nothing beats it . __eou__ Then you must know Shen Due and Hao Hongbo . __eou__ Oh , I didn't expect you to know them . But yes , I love them not only because of many medals they've won , but also because of many medals they've won , but also because of their spirits . __eou__ You should go to talk with May .

I wish people would just leave me alone ! __eou__

This man is your fiance , Dolly ? __eou__ Yeah , how do you like him ? __eou__ He's handsome . __eou__ Can you give me a touch of his character ? __eou__ He's outgoing and honest , but sometimes he's a bit conservative . __eou__
I'm the coolest high-tech stud around ... __eou__ Why ? Do you have a robot girlfriend ? __eou__ Not yet ...

have you read the feature article about Oprah Winfrey in this magazine ? __eou__ no , what's it about ? __eou__ apparently , she's being given an award for donating so much money to charity . __eou__ she's very generous with her money . I think that's because she was poor when she was young . __eou__ I heard that she's one of the wealthiest women in the world . __eou__ I'd believe it . She owns magazines , television shows and she has a huge fan base . __eou__ you know ; I heard that she was opening a school for underprivileged girls in Africa . __eou__ did they mention that in the article ? __eou__ yes , she's not only building the school , but is also using her own money for the upkeep of the school and to pay the teachers a fair salary . __eou__ that's really commendable . I think more celebrities should use their money to help people like Oprah has . __eou__ I agree . So many celebrities waste their money on sports cars , expensive clothing , and luxurious hotels . __eou__ it's amazing how much money they can spend . I heard Britney Spears once spent $ 24,000 a night on a hotel room ! __eou__ what a waste . It's good to see some stars that are more concerned with charity than status symbols . __eou__

I ’ Ve always wanted to do something like that ! Have you learned anything useful ? __eou__ For sure ! I mean we ’ Ve learned how to apply pressure to stop bleeding , how to check for a pulse , and even how to apply CPR ! __eou__ Have you treated any real emergencies ? __eou__ Well , they took us along with some paramedics.There was this guy who fell off his motorcycle and suffered a concussion as well as a couple of compound fractures . His wounds were pretty serious so they had to rush him to the hospital . It was intense ! __eou__ I can imagine !

I have a chronic fear of flying . __eou__ Oh really ? I have an uncle who is also terrified of flying . It ' s not that bad though , I mean , it is pretty scary to be in this big machine flying through the air at seven hundred miles per hour . I actually have arachnophobia . __eou__ You ' re scared of spiders ? I actually have two more phobias . Acrophobia and glossophobia . __eou__ I guess that explains why you are afraid of flying , but public speaking is not that bad . __eou__ Are you kidding ? When I get on stage , my palms start to sweat , I get really nervous and I can hardly speak . __eou__ Well , I must confess I am a bit claustrophobic . I hate being in an elevator for more than 5 seconds . __eou__ We are such weirdos right ? __eou__
Hi , Fanny . __eou__ Hi , Andy . __eou__ Are you feeling OK ? You sound a little tired this morning . __eou__ I did not sleep much last night . I really feel bad .

She had heard me crying out for help . __eou__ You have got a great mother . __eou__ I felt embarrased . After all , I am 18 years old .

I am worrying about getting into the University of Michigan . __eou__ Me too . But I tell myself that if they don ’ t accept me , another school will . __eou__

We'd appreciate your kind consideration in the coming negotiation . Let's drink to our friendship . __eou__ Let's hope for good cooperation between us . __eou__
Confronted with difficult questions in an interview , the job-hunters mostly will be at a loss about what to do . __eou__ Usually , you cannot prepare for these questions in advance and have to depend on your immediate performance . __eou__ Still , there are some rules to follow . __eou__ In this case , you should first keep calm and normal to the face . __eou__ Don't get nervous and freaked out . __eou__ Formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation . __eou__ There should be neither too much silence nor hasty answers __eou__ Try to show the best of yourself with decent words and manners . __eou__ Don't be discouraged even when confronted with negative questions __eou__ You should admit your weakness frankly . __eou__ Anyway , what really matters is that you have tried your best . __eou__ You must have confidence in yourself . __eou__

Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ? __eou__ I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ’ s better to get to know it . What about you ? __eou__ I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays . __eou__ Oh , my God ! John , I didn ’ t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory . __eou__ Come on , Han Maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion . __eou__ But I ’ m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ? __eou__ Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world . __eou__ I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ’ t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ? __eou__ That ’ s a little complicated . You ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ’ s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England . __eou__ Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ? __eou__ Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans . __eou__ How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ? __eou__ That ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries . __eou__ So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ? __eou__ Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College . __eou__ Why did they want to found a college ? __eou__ Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__ Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name . __eou__ When did it begin to be called Harvard University ? __eou__ In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman . __eou__ It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion . __eou__ Therefore , it ’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard . __eou__ Wow , I didn ’ t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history . __eou__ Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S . __eou__ I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard . __eou__ Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related . __eou__ That ’ s right . I have a lot to learn from you . __eou__ You can ask me any question at any time . __eou__
Can I borrow these magazines ? __eou__ Fill in the slip , then take it to the circulation desk . They will get you what you want . __eou__ Are we allowed to go into the stacks to look for books ? __eou__ Sorry , the stacks are closed to undergraduate students . __eou__
Rachel has decided to quit smoking . __eou__ Really ? Why ? __eou__ You never guess she is going to have a baby . __eou__ Oh , it's unbelievable . She is such a chain smoker . __eou__ Yes , yes . She said she is going to stop drinking coffee too and quit all the unhealthy habits just for the baby . __eou__ Oh , she is going to be a great mother . __eou__
When I was at school , I was quite good at track and field events . I was on the school team for the long jump , 100 and 200 meter sprints and the javelin . __eou__ Really ? I was quite good at the hurdles and the discus . __eou__ I wish that I were good at the discus , but I could rarely throw it in the right direction ! I was awful . With the hurdles , I could never jump over them ! __eou__ I thought you were good at the high jump ! __eou__ No , I was good at the long jump . I liked the sprints best . __eou__ Did you ever win any competitions ? __eou__ I was regional champion for the 100 and 200 meters . I usually did well in the dong jump competitions , but I couldn ’ t compete with kids from other schools in the javelin . How about you ? __eou__ I came second and third a few times in the regional championships , but I never won . Did you ever take part in the national championship for the sprinting events ? __eou__ Yes , I did , but I didn ’ t do very well . I made the final in both events , but came last . At least I made the final . I was very pleased with that . __eou__
Do you have a copy of today ’ s newspaper ? I want to check the results from the world athletics championship . __eou__ Yes , I ‘ m just reading them myself . It ’ s been a great competition . We got gold medals in three events . __eou__ Yes , we won the men ’ s 110 metres hurdles . I watched that on TV . What other events did we win ? __eou__ We won the men ’ s high jump and the women ’ s 1500 meters . __eou__ That ’ s great . Those athletes must train for years to get into peak physical condition . They must be terribly disappointed if they don ’ t win . __eou__ The woman who won the 1500 meters also broke the world record by 2 seconds . __eou__ That ’ s amazing ! Were any other records broken ? __eou__ A Russian man broke the discus record by a centimeters . Out best athlete broke his personal best in the long jump , but it only got him third place . __eou__ Did you see the final of the men ’ s 100 metres ? It was very exciting . One competitor made two false starts . __eou__ Was he disqualified ? __eou__ Yes , he was . I imagine he must be very angry with himself for that . __eou__
Has Alan shown up yet ? __eou__ Nope . I guess something might have come up . __eou__ I wonder what happened . __eou__ I don't know . I hope it's nothing serious . __eou__ Last week his sister was admitted to the hospital . __eou__ Oh ? What happened ? __eou__ His sister had a car accident last week . __eou__ Is she fine now ? __eou__ She is still in a coma . __eou__ Oh , poor Alan ! His sister is the only one he has left since his parents died last year . __eou__
Well , I ’ d better get back to work . I ’ Ve got a ton of stuff on my desk ! __eou__ Me too . I ’ ll see you after work , huh ? __eou__ Yeah , definitely . I was hoping to catch a ride with you . __eou__ Sure . Meet me at five . __eou__
Doctor , save my baby , please __eou__ What symptoms does he have ? __eou__ He has had a fever for one day . Just now at home , he had febrile convulsions with teeth and fists clenched and eyes turned up . We were at a loss what to do . We called an ambulance and brought the baby here . __eou__ How long did the convulsion last ? __eou__ About 3 minutes . __eou__ Does he have any other complaints ? __eou__ Three days ago , he began to cough , sneeze and have a running nose . Yesterday , he began to have a fever . __eou__ Have you taken his temperature ? __eou__ It was 38 ° C this morning and it was 39 ° C just now . __eou__ Let me examine him to see if there is any rash .

Give the baby plenty of water to drink . __eou__ Thank you very much , doctor . __eou__

It reflects a nation's character . __eou__ Yes , it not only includes the nation's historical and cultural background , but also contains the nation's view of life way of life and way of thinking . __eou__ So in foreign trade , you must be very clear about language differences . __eou__

Bob ! Your eyes look bloodshot . Did you not sleep well ? __eou__ I had a drop too much last night . I attended a banquet given by a Chinese colleague of mine . And it was startling for me to find that people are forced to drink against their will on a Chinese table . __eou__ you have it right . Alcohol is a medium for communicating emotion in China . Drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship , especially in Northern China . __eou__ I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me . But if I keep gulping down one cup after another , I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick . __eou__ you lose face by refusing to drink , and the host might think you refuse to give him face . The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up . This will endear you __eou__ a few guys even threw a drunken fit last night , crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that I never understood . __eou__ then he must be opening his heart to the friends . In a word , as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort , no one will jeer at you . __eou__ I got you . Next time . I'll preface a toast with a statement like ' I can't drink any more ' and then drink anyway . __eou__

They are worried about losing their job because there is surplus in labor force these days . __eou__ That ’ s not right , somebody should do something . __eou__
Oops ! __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ I overcooked the corn . __eou__ That's okay . I like it better that way anyway . __eou__

Hello ? Ms . Patterson ? This is Bill from Workmate calling . I'm just wondering if you had a chance to look over the estimate I sent for your gala dinner project next month ... As I said in my email , we can help you with production according to your needs , but we will only be able to give insite management support services on a limited basis . __eou__ Oh , yes . I reviewed your estimate . But it seems like the project blueprint you sent with the estimate is not quite what we had in mind . Did you get a copy of the specs for this project ? __eou__ Yes , I have several copies , but they're all different versions ... The latest I have is version 12 , is that current ? __eou__ No . Later we decided to opt for the prior outline , version 7 . __eou__ Hold on , let me pull up your version 7 requirements ... Oh yes , no wonder our estimate is a little different from what you had in mind . I see the version 7 also includes 6 additional hostesses and a cocktail self-serve bar that wasn't in the version 12 . That will definitely add to your cost on this project ... __eou__
Excuse me , sir . I am coming to apply for the position of accountant . __eou__ Oh , please sit down . What university did you graduate from ? __eou__ I graduated from Tianjin College of Commerce . __eou__ What was your major at college ? __eou__ My major was accounting . __eou__ Can you name some of the courses you completed in relation to accounting ? __eou__ Sure . I took such courses as accounting principles , commercial accounting , cost accounting , industrial accounting , electronic data processing accounting , and accounting involved in foreign capital enterprises . __eou__ What kind of work are you doing now ? __eou__ I'm engaged in accounting . __eou__ What are your responsibilities in your present work ? __eou__ My work involves various routine bookkeeping and basic accounting tasks including journal entries , verifying data and reconciling discrepancies , preparing detailed reports from raw data , and checking accounting documents for completeness , mathematical accuracy and consistency . __eou__ Are you familiar with the PRC Financial and Tax Regulations ? __eou__ I think so . __eou__ Can you tell me something about this balance sheet now ? __eou__ Of course . This balance sheet contains three major sections , that is , assets , liabilities and owner's equity . So , you see , the total current liabilities of your company are $ 3,372 , 000 , and the owner's equity is $ 5,400 , 000 . That means that the total assets , which is equal to the sum of the creditor's and the owner's equities , are $ 8,772 , 000 . __eou__ What's the creditor's equity ? __eou__ The creditor's equity is the same as liabilities . __eou__
Is the environment a big issues in your country ? It is in mine . __eou__ It is in mine too.The biggest issue is water . The climate is dry and so water conservation is very important . __eou__ What methods do you use to conserve water ? __eou__ Water is rationed . We can only use a certain amount each month . It means that we cannot use some modern household items , like washing machines . They use too much water . __eou__ I see . I think the biggest environment problem in my country is air pollution . __eou__ Yes , I agree . The air here is much more polluted than in my country . Of course , my country is more agricultural and has much less industry . __eou__ We have reduced emission of air pollutants in recent years , but cars are still a major source of them . Factories have become cleaner as stricter environment pollution law have been introduced . __eou__ The problem is now on a truly global scale . I don ’ t believe that any single country can do anything about it . __eou__ I think you ’ re right . There needs to be an international response to this problem . __eou__

Are you interested ? __eou__ Yeah , definitely ! Thanks for inviting me . __eou__ My pleasure . __eou__ I really wanted to watch the Star Wars on the opening day , but the pre-sale tickets were sold out . How did you manage to get hold of them ? __eou__ A friend of mine works at the corporate headquarters of Pepsi , which is a major sponsor of the movie . He was able to get the tickets for free , and then he sold two more for me for 50 dollars a piece . __eou__ You paid 50 dollars for each ticket ? That's a huge premium over the regular price . __eou__ Not really . Considering the fact that other people were willing to pay as much as 200 dollars each on the black market . Besides , I knew you were really looking forward to watching Star Wars on the opening day . __eou__ Wow ! I am really honored you went through all this trouble just for my sake . I really appreciate that . So , what time are we going ? __eou__ Well , let's see . The movie stars at 10 . We should be there at least 1 hour earlier , because there is a big line . I could pick you up at your house at 8 , if that's ok with you . __eou__ 8 pm , that's fine with me . __eou__ Okay . __eou__ So I'll see you tomorrow then at 8 . __eou__ Yeah , that's great . I'll see you tomorrow night . __eou__ Ok , George . Bye ! __eou__ Bye , Ann ! __eou__

We've developed very quickly . __eou__ Do you think the trend will continue ? __eou__ I don't see why not . We do have some problems , but we are still willing to work hard and wages aren't too high at this point . __eou__ Everything I've seen so far is very impressive , very impressive indeed . __eou__
We're on the same team here , Elvin . I'm being nice because we need to get along together . __eou__ I know you , Zina .

Then , Mary . We need 10 more loose-leaf binders , five pounds of heavy duty white paper , and what else did I say ? __eou__ Two boxes of transparencies for the over-head machines . __eou__ Right .

Put on the news . I got up late and missed it . __eou__ All right . __eou__
Welcome to Al ’ s Garage . What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ No problem at all ! I am taking a long road trip and I want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition . __eou__ Very wise decision . When was the last time you had a tune up ? __eou__ Not that long ago , I think it was four months ago . __eou__ We usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers . __eou__ Why ? I mean , what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often ? __eou__ First of all , we change the motor oil and oil filter . If you don ’ t do this , it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves . __eou__ I see . What else ? __eou__ We also check your spark plugs , fuel filter , and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid . We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones . __eou__ Ok , well , when you put it that way , it doesn ’ t seem like a waste of time and money . __eou__ Trust me , regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs . __eou__
Professor , I've handed in my paper . Did you read it ? __eou__ Yes . You've done a good job . But there's one thing . You should narrow down your topic . __eou__ What about water pollution instead of pollution ? __eou__

It's perfect for you ! __eou__ Yeah ... I know . But I'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles ! __eou__ What kind of power struggles are you talking about ? __eou__ Basically , I think Tim is threatened by me . I'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career ! __eou__ So he talks about you behind your back ? __eou__ Yes . He's all nice and friendly to my face . But the second I turn around he stabs me in the back ! __eou__ I had a worker like that once . She was always taking credit for my ideas . __eou__ I should keep a better record of my correspondence with the clients so if necessary I can prove it was my effort . __eou__ My co-worker had a whole bunch of bad office habits . She liked to name-drop ... we would be in a meeting and she would say , yesterday I was chatting with Tom . She meant Tom Solomon ... our CEO . __eou__
Hi , Bob , everything okay ? __eou__ more or less . There's just one thing bothering me . __eou__ oh ? What's that ? __eou__ well , you know I have some students studying for their master's degree . One of them tried to give me a gift that kind made me uneasy . __eou__ what gift ? __eou__ it's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift __eou__ you refused the gift ? That's terrible . __eou__ I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way . __eou__ perhaps . He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade . __eou__ that's what I am worried about . I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored . But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . __eou__

Good morning golf aficionados ! My name is Rick Fields , and you guessed it , I am here with my main man , Bob Copeland . __eou__ Thank you , Rick ! As you can see , ladies and gentleman , we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are trying to win the grand prize of one million dollars ! __eou__ Whoa , that ’ s a lot of cash ! Let ’ s go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing . __eou__ All right , we are here at the eighth hole . It ’ s a par four , and has some very difficult hazards which many golfers find difficult to avoid . Although , I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole ! __eou__ Tiger Woods is about to tee off , and let ’ s see if he has the same luck as Jack . Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and , he seems to be very nervous . __eou__ Oh no ! Not a good swing at all ! It ’ s definitely not his day today . On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par . He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot . __eou__ It seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees . He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it . __eou__ Oh no ! A bear ! Run , Tiger , run ! Somebody call animal control ! __eou__
I want to fly to Congo on Monday , the 17th . __eou__ Let me see what's available . __eou__ By the way , I'd prefer a night flight . __eou__ Africa Airline 551 leaves at 9:00 pm . __eou__ That's fine . I want to pay in cash . Here is the money . __eou__
We've got very good workshop facilities here . We do all our own servicing and most repairs .

If we don't have the facilities to deal with it here , we send it out for maintenance . __eou__ Is that more expensive ? __eou__ It depends on the job . It's actually more cost-effective than buying specialist equipment that we don't use very often . __eou__
Margaret , I'd like to follow up with the arrangements for our company retreat , to take place next month . We need to book the venue , make arrangements for speakers and door prizes , and set up all the activities and accommodations . Also , very important , we need to determine which of our staff will be eligible and will be available to go . We've got to get a head count in order to make reservations . __eou__ What's the criteria for staff to attend ? Are we only including our management team in this affair ? Or will we be extending invitations to lower level employees to attend ? __eou__ Lower level employees need not attend . The purpose of this retreat is for training , especially for our management team . We want to develop a well-oiled machine on our executive level . In order to get everyone to jell together , we've got to include some fun . That's the reason for the retreat . __eou__

Let's buy the cheaper one . __eou__

Countries like Monaco are smaller than many cities . __eou__ Those small countries are microscopic compared to Russia . European countries are relatively small . France looks quite big in Europe , but compared to many countries in other continents , it ’ s not very large at all . __eou__ Britain is half the size of france , but great Britain is still one of the largest islands in the world . __eou__ The thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used . Russia and Canada have enormous areas of ice and forest . __eou__

Do you think discrimination against women in the work force is still prevalent even today ? __eou__ From my own experience as a career woman , I would have to say that while things are getting better now than they used to be , it is still a widespread problem . Society is changing , but there is still a glass ceiling for women in many career tracks . __eou__ do you think the glass ceiling phenomena is because of traditional social customs ? Or are there more issues coming into play ? __eou__ I think it's a very complicated issue . A part of the difficulties women have advancing in the work force are due to few opportunities and many male managers . Don't underestimate the good ole ' boy system . Men have power , so it's easier for them to stay in power . __eou__ What about affirmative action ? Hasn't legislation changed a lot of the make hierarchy ? __eou__ Affirmative action has given us management quotas and bans sexual discrimination , but it's still a man's world . __eou__
What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ Your secretary seems to think she is being harassed . __eou__ What ? You've got to be kidding me ! __eou__ I wish I were , but i am deadly serious . She said you invited her to dinner last week . __eou__ Of course I did . As recognition for a job well done . Once a month I invite the most productive employee to dinner . __eou__ Well , there is no problem there . But she seemed to think that you were angry when she refused , and that your motives are personal and not professional . __eou__ I think she's misinterpreted my intentions . What happens now ? __eou__ Our harassment policy requires that we have a meeting with the HR manager and Miss Brown . It's quite serious . You could be reprimanded , or even fired if we find evidence that you were pressuring __eou__ I understand that . But I hope that we can get to the bottom fo this and show Miss Brown that she misunderstood my reaction . __eou__ That's the purpose of the meeting . Sometimes a mediated conversation will straighten things out , and a little discussion and apology can calm the waters . __eou__
I met a girl in elevator this morning . She works in a company upstairs . She said she envied the casual way we dress for work . She complained about the dress rule in her company . It requires everyone to wear formal clothes from Monday to Friday . __eou__ Well , I was wondering where those people with professional attire come from . Now , I know the answer . __eou__ You know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ’ t that strict ? __eou__ To some extent , it is . Anyway , whether they like it or not , they do give people a very good impression . __eou__ But it is unjust to judge a book by its cover . If they ’ re not happy or comfortable with their clothes , they can be less productive . __eou__

How do you see your career development ? __eou__ After a few years of gaining experience in the company and furthering my professional qualifications I'd like to put my experience and skills to use in management . I want to become a supervisor in your R & D department . __eou__ Have you anything to ask about the job ? __eou__ Yes . Do you offer any opportunities for further study ? __eou__ Yes .

This must not exceed its net assets and no business loss can be shown during the past two years . __eou__ Right , OK . That , again , shouldn't be a problem . __eou__ And the total ratio of return on assets should not be lower than the average , for that particular industry , for the first two quarters of the year . __eou__ Well , as far as I can tell , we qualify . __eou__ Of course we will need proof , originals and duplicate of everything . As soon as you bring in the proof and we assess it , it should be very quick indeed . __eou__
Post office offer lots of services nowadays , don ’ t they ? Years age , you only really used the post office to send mail , save money , and send or collect money . __eou__ Nowadays , they offer so many services , you hardly know which one to choose . Take mailing for example . Do you send something first class or second class or do you use EMS ? __eou__ I save money in a post office saving account . There used to be just one kind of account , but now there are several . They each have different conditions and interest rates . __eou__ You can buy things at post office that were never sold there before . You can buy sweets and chocolates , newspapers , birthday and Christmas cards ... __eou__ Post offices are still the place to go to collect welfare benefits , like unemployment benefit and child support benefit . The queue are very long on the days when people collect those payment . __eou__ My son likes going to the main post office . They have a philately counter where he can buy stamps for his collection . __eou__ Do you think that the service at post offices has improved ? __eou__ I think it ’ s better for some things , like sending and receiving money , but if you need to post something it sometimes takes longer than it used to . __eou__ I like being able to buy newspapers and magazines at the post office . It means that I don ’ t need to go to two places __eou__
Julia , burglaries in our town have been on the wing . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ I heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . The robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight . __eou__ Thank God , we haven't encountered a burglar . I hope that our house is secure against burglary . __eou__ I am worrying about it too . I want to install a security door . __eou__ Is the security door useful ? __eou__ Yes , I think so . The security door is so firm that nobody can break in . __eou__ I totally agree with you . In this way I won't be afraid of the burglar if you are away . __eou__ OK , I will do it right now . __eou__

Well , Mike , nowadays there's much talk about nanometer . But what on earth is it ? __eou__ Nanometer is a length scale . It's one billionth of a meter , roughly ten times the size of an individual atom . __eou__ Hmm ... it's hard to figure out the exact size , I'm afraid . __eou__ Well , let's make it this way . For comparison , 10 NM is 1000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair . There are as many nanometers in an inch as there are inches in 400 miles . __eou__ I see.Thank you . __eou__
Where's Bill ? The ambassador is already here . The meeting is set to start at 9 am . __eou__ He's late again . Traffic is probably holding him up . You know , he commutes from the suburbs . It's not easy commuting every day . We should cut him some slack . __eou__ Even though the traffic is bumper-to-bumper out there , I don't think it's heavy traffic that makes Bill late . He takes the train , remember ? __eou__ Oh , that's right . Well , the train shouldn't be late . That means there is only one explanation ... Bill must have overslept . __eou__ Well , to be fare , since he's coming all the way from Lancaster , he's got to get up much earlier than the rest of us . He must get start on his commute about six thirty , no telling what time he actually gets up . __eou__ That's right , because he's got to get to the train station from his house , then take the blue line into the city , then switch trains to the red line . In all , the trip's got to take more than 2 hours . __eou__ Why doesn't he just drive to work ? __eou__ It's too difficult to park your car in the city . Also , the traffic coming in from the suburbs is a nightmare . __eou__

I've almost forgot the location was transferred to the A county in the east of the city . __eou__ I'll tell them . __eou__ Well , the most important thing is that our company demand the quality be exactly the same as the sample which you'll take from the office on the third floor . __eou__ Please feel assured that we'll abide by our promise . And we'll do everything we can to ensure delivery . __eou__ Thanks a lot . And I believe I'll have a good time working with you . __eou__ I think so . Bye ! __eou__ Bye ! __eou__

What characteristics should an interpreter own ? __eou__ I think he should be an expert of everything . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ Because English is nothing but a tool which is used when people may negotiate in international conferences , probe into physics , release some information in a press conferrence , and do anything we can do with language . Therefore , an interpreter has to know some expertise in the field he / she serves as an interpreter . Otherwise he / she can not carry out his / her work smoothly . __eou__

Hi Barbara . Have you lost weight ? __eou__ Hi Julie . Yeah . I've been on a diet for a couple of months now . __eou__ Wow . You look great . __eou__ Thanks for noticing . __eou__ What type of diet were you on ? __eou__ I joined a health club and my trainer gave me tips on eating . With a combination of eating better and exercising , I managed to lose 15 pounds in 2 months . __eou__ That's amazing . What tips did your trainer give you ? __eou__ Mostly on how to exercise , but the best advice I got was changing my eating habits . Instead of eating 3 times a day , she told me to eat 5 times a day . __eou__ That doesn't make sense . If you eat more , than how do you lose weight ? __eou__ Actually , I'm eating the same amount . I eat 5 smaller meals a day . Basically , it naturally speeds up the metabolism and helps to burn fat at a faster rate . __eou__ That makes sense . I'm going to try that . __eou__ You don't need to lose weight . __eou__ I have a little gut I have been trying to get rid of . __eou__ Ah ... but remember to incorporate a little exercise into your diet . __eou__ Thanks for the advice . __eou__ No problem . __eou__

She must be getting on a bit now . __eou__ Yeah , but she looks amazing . __eou__ So what's the movie about ? __eou__ Well , it's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . But then she got reincarnated as a cat . __eou__ Huh ? __eou__ I know . Stay with me . She then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss . First , though , she had to discover her true cat nature . At the end she had a big fight with Sharon Stone , who was the real danger in the company .

Batwoman married the boss ? __eou__ No . Sharon Stone was married to the boss , who treated her badly , so she killed him . So where was I ? OK , so then , at the same time she fell in love with a cop , who was investigating the murder of the boss .

Maybe , I eat three meals a day and I try not to snack in between . No potato chips . No popcorn . No candy bars . __eou__ That's pretty tough ! __eou__

Isn't it wonderful walking here ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us . __eou__ Yes , look over there . That's the Empire State Building . My book says it's 102 stories tall . __eou__ It's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ? __eou__ You're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering . __eou__ What other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ? __eou__ Quite a number . Actually every skyscraper has a history . A few blocks ahead we'll see St.Patrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center . It's a landmark in the history of architecture . __eou__ What's there after that ? __eou__ Well then , there's a Central Park . Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world . __eou__ What are they all for ? __eou__ Most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . New York is one of the financial centers of the world . And there are lots of very expensive places . __eou__
Have you heard anything about Markweed Inc . ? They have called me back for interview , and I'm considering taking a job with them . __eou__ Well , to start with , Markweed Inc . has a reputation for being one of the best employers in the field . __eou__ The best ... huh ? With so many companies out there , how did they establish themselves in such a solid position on top ? __eou__ First of all , they have an excellent benefits package for all employees , even the maintenance staff have health and dental coverage . __eou__ Really ? What about the pay rate ? Are the wages pretty high ? __eou__ From what I hear , they are very reasonable . A lot of the prestige the company has built is because they have attacked some high profile employees with their incentives . __eou__ Well , what about the work environment ? Not every one is motivated solely by money . __eou__ It's a great place to work . They give you fair pay and benefits , and a lot of room to grow . I think if they off you a job , you should definitely take it . __eou__

It has Julia Roberts playing the female lead . __eou__ I like thrillers and I like Julia Roberts , so it might be interesting . I read a review today and the critic didn ’ t seem to be very impressed . __eou__ What did the critic say ? __eou__ He didn ’ t say it was bad , but he said that it wasn ’ t as good as it could have been , particularly as there were some good actors and actresses in it . __eou__ The movie starts at eight o ’ clock , so we have plenty of time to eat and get ready . __eou__ Good . Dinner is nearly ready and I ’ d like to watch the news before we go . The Oscars were last night and I want to see the results . __eou__ I won ’ t spoil your enjoyment by telling you who won . There were a few surprises . __eou__
What sort of problems do you have with these machines ? __eou__ They're quite complex machines and they have a lot of different components . We need to check the metal casing regularly for any signs of corrosion . We also check the brushes once a fortnight to make sure they aren't worn down . It's important to make sure everything is properly aligned and we adjust it if necessary . There is a canvas belt at the end of the assembly line . If it gets wet , it might rot so we check that regularly too . __eou__
Couldn't you extend the delivery period by two weeks ? That would make things much easier for us . __eou__ Well , you know the time of shipment means a lot to us . __eou__ I can understand , but our company is fully committed at the moment , and hundreds of clients are placing orders for delivery these days . __eou__ I see.OK , that's agreed then . __eou__
Mr Hughes ? Do you have a minute ? I would like to discuss something with you . __eou__ What can I do for you ? __eou__ I was wondering , I have heard many of my co-wokers that your knowledge and experience in international markets is phenomenal . Also , I ’ Ve heard the rumor that you speak fluent Japanese . Is that right ? __eou__ Yes , that ’ s right . I do speak decent Japanese . __eou__ Right now I ’ m working on a product launch project to open up our Asian market . We have several upcoming events to take place for the Japanese cities . We ’ ll be heading to Tokyo next month to get things started .

Why don't you begin by telling me something about yourself ? __eou__ What do you want to know ? __eou__ The usual , you know , something about your background and experience and anything personal that you feel is pertinent . __eou__ Well , I was born in Shanghai and went to school there , right up through college . My father is a lawyer , and my mother is a teacher . __eou__ Sounds as if you come from a professional family . __eou__ That right . One of my sisters is a doctor and the other one teaches at a university . __eou__ What made you decide to get into computers ? __eou__ Oh , nothing in particular , I guess . I always liked mathematics and tinkering with machines . __eou__ Now what about your experience ? How long have you been working with computers ? __eou__ More than five years now . After I did my engineering degree , I began to specialize in computer technology and I even had my own company for a while . __eou__ It certainly sounds impressive . Why don't you have your credentials sent to me and I'll show them to the board ? We'll probably get back to you in a week . __eou__ Thanks very much . __eou__

So , got any more ideas for the website ? __eou__ Well , since we're collecting gifts instead of red envelopes , I made a " for guests only " gift chat room . __eou__ But we registered at Macy's . People can just buy gifts there . __eou__ The Taiwanese won't have time to buy gifts in America . The chat room is more convenient . __eou__ You're right . They can discuss what to get and avoid buying the same things . __eou__ Or discuss what gifts they could buy together . __eou__ Any other ideas ? __eou__ We can also put a guest book on the website for people to sign and write comments . __eou__ And we were going to make a collage for each of us using our baby pictures ... __eou__ Yeah , that will be the best part . Jack hasn't seen yours yet , right ? __eou__ No . He has no idea what a fat little pig I was ! __eou__
Besides , yours don't have side pockets like mine . __eou__ Cool ! They're big !

That's incredible ! __eou__ Maybe . But you'd be amazed at how little's left after the credit companies have deducted their share from my account . __eou__ Hey , I know what that's like . I bought a BMW on my Visa card . Now the payments really hurt . __eou__ Well , you're lucky that you're still able to make your payments . I missed a credit payment last month . Now my bank account's overdrawn , and the company is threatening to take back my purchases . __eou__ What did you buy ? __eou__ A new home health monitor . __eou__ Health Monitor ?

You know this traffic jam is really bad with so many new cars hitting the streets these days . __eou__

I feel like having something special like Neapolitan ice cream . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ It's three different flavors mixed together . Chocolate , strawberry and something green with candied fruit . __eou__ Do they have ice cream bars . frozen yogurt or frozen chocolate mousse ? __eou__ Absolutely ! They also have real Italian Galatian and French sorbets . They do a great baked Alaska . __eou__ Maybe a vanilla ice cream milkshake would be good .

What do you think of it ? __eou__ The city is small , not very modern , but there are many mountains with lots of trees around the city , so the air there is pretty fresh . __eou__ Did you go to the Summer Mountain Resort ? __eou__ Certainly ! The most attractive place is that , it's very large ; it is 8 times the size of Forbidden City and 16 times the size of Summer Palace . The art of gardens is perfectly represented in it . __eou__ It sounds great , and is it really cool there ? __eou__ Yes , I think the reason is that there is a big lake , and many trees in the Resort . __eou__ What is the special local product ? __eou__ The main product of Chende is various kinds of ferine mushroom and the almond . The mushroom tastes really good , and it is very different from the common mushrooms , and the snack made of almond is delicious . __eou__ I hope to go there someday . __eou__
Come on , you are left behind ! __eou__ Wow , I can't catch my breath . You are running too fast , honey . __eou__ You just need more exercise . __eou__ Yes , but you need to slow down . This is jogging , not racing ! __eou__ I don't care . I want to burn up my fat . __eou__ But running so fast is not good for people over forties . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ We are not as athletic as we were when young . Mild exercise is more suitable for us . __eou__ But I want to burn up more calories ! __eou__ In fact , in order to burn up your fat , you must take it slowly for a longer time . __eou__ Really ? I will slow down then . __eou__
I've just got a new printer . How often do I need to replace the print heads ? __eou__ Well , under normal conditions each head lasts about 5 000 copies or so .

You know the Chinese economic legislation is still incomplete ? __eou__ I don't think I have any problem with our Chinese partners . They have always followed the contract strictly . We can do business directly with the corporation . As I mentioned before , the Chinese government is trying very hard to perfect its law . Its commercial legislation provides legal protection for foreign companies . __eou__ Well , it's known that the Sino-American relation is in a dilemma . Does it influence your business in China ? __eou__ Actually not at present . But we are afraid it will . You know policies influence business to some extent . I hope our government will not be influenced by some extremists . China is really a large market . We don't want to lose it . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ You're welcome . __eou__

I don't eat or use any animal based products . I don't wear leather , eat eggs , drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . I used to be a pescatarian before , which basically means you don't eat meat , but still have fish and seafood . __eou__ Wow ! That's interesting ! It must be tough ! __eou__ It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes , but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays , it's getting a bit less difficult . __eou__
Some people are always closing their handsets , so it's difficult to inform them . __eou__ Why not send them short messages ? __eou__ Can short messages reach them ? __eou__ Short messages will be kept in the short messages center .

If it's not too complicated I will send a short message , which can save much phone charge . __eou__ I am informed that many people used short messages to pay a New Year call , and only on the Spring Festival it amounted to 1 billion this year , didn't it ? __eou__ I almost can't live without messages , from which I learn about weather forecasts and stock quotations . __eou__
There will be another sandstorm here tomorrow . __eou__ It's the fourth one this year . Isn't it horrible . __eou__ Yes .

That is one of the most beautiful areas in Oxford . The surrounding area is really peaceful , and getting into the city centre from there is very convenient . How can he afford that place ? __eou__ He didn't buy it . His grandfather died recently and left him loads of money . __eou__ Did he know that his grandfather was so wealthy ? __eou__ No one in the family expected to get a dime from him . It was quite a surprise . __eou__ What a lucky man . __eou__ He still has a complaint though . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ He wanted to live right on a bus line , but he doesn't . so , if he wants to take a bus anywhere , he has to walk 1/4 mile to get to a bus stop . __eou__ The poor thing .

Walter , did you email that document to Mr . Lin yesterday ? __eou__ Yes , I did , Ms . Chen . __eou__ That's strange . I have Mr . Lin on the phone right now , and he says that he didn't receive any email from us yesterday . Are you sure you sent it ? __eou__ I'm positive , Ms . Chen . __eou__

My computer isn ’ t running at the same speed it used to be , it is testing my patience everyday . Can you tell me how to make it run faster ? __eou__ If you want to speed up your system , you ’ Ve got to clean it up first . __eou__ How ? __eou__ You need to free your disk space . The simplest way is to use a Disk-Cleanup tool to remove temporary files and in store programs that you no longer use . Things should be fine next time you start . You also need to control what starts up . There is a program calls Start-up Delayer , It can help to set after how much time programs should be loaded after Windows boosts . For example , you can choose to set your Fox Mail program to load 30 seconds after Windows starts up . __eou__ Very useful advice , I will try them right now . __eou__
Looking through your C . V . , I see that you graduated from Oklahoma State University . Can you tell me what training you have had that would specifically relate to the cable television Industry ? __eou__ Well , I ’ Ve attended some conferences in this field .

Did you have anything specific in mind ? __eou__ Well , I notice that you currently provide an on-screen TV Guide . At the moment , it just scrolls the names of the programs in a repeated loop . If you have many channels , you have to wait a long t __eou__ That ’ s impressive . How would you make that pay ? __eou__ Tie it in with the pay-per-view services , and perhaps it could be a money-maker . __eou__ I see you have several good ideas . Now , I just have a few questions about your C . V . I notice that there is a five-year gap between your last job and now . __eou__ Yes , I took a break from work during that time . I had a baby , and as she was born with a handicap , I decided to suspend my career . But I have continued to keep up with the Industry through con __eou__ So , you ’ re just starting back . Maybe you ’ d better tell me a little more about your experience . __eou__

My friend once used it mostly to play chess , but now he has learnt how to do other things on the Internet . __eou__ There's no doubt the Internet will be a powerful commercial medium . It'll connect hundreds of millions of customers and open up huge markets for all kinds of products and services . __eou__ That's true . I can imagine companies sending advertisements directly to customers over the net . Customers , in turn , can examine and compare whatever goods they want to buy and tell their computers to find them at the best price offered . __eou__ Yeah . It'll be a shoppers heaven . That's the use of net in E-commerce . __eou__

Did your company go union ? I heard that many companies in out industry are being unionized , so It's getting harder and harder to compete on a level playing field . __eou__ Yes , we're hopping on the bandwagon and signing up for the union . Mostly people are pretty happy about it ... I guess it depends on if you are in management or in the labor force . __eou__ Management isn't looking on the labor unions too favorably , I'd guess . I don't blame them ... labor unions can really put the squeeze on the executives . __eou__ Sure ... but it's probably better for the workers , because the union's whole purpose is to look out for the little guys . The only way that the little guys can take on the big bosses is if they unite . Labor unions are all about getting a voice for the underdog . __eou__

I just want to be able to get online , play games and chat with my friends . Oh , and watch movies online as well . __eou__ Well , this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . I suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . That way you can play games online without any lag . This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall absolutely free ! __eou__ Do I have to pay an installation fee ? __eou__ Lucky for you , this month we aren ’ t charging our normal installation fee . You are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! And we ’ ll throw in this pen drive ! __eou__ Awesome ! __eou__
I seldom heard the quarreling of her children . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ Because her children have been the age when they seem to quarrel all day long . __eou__ Oh , I see . She told me that she had learned very quickly how to pour oil on troubled waters , but not to pour oil on the flame . __eou__ She is a clever mother . __eou__
How is grandpa doing recently ? __eou__ Not good . The doctor told him not to smoke again , but it just rolls off him like water off the duck ’ s back ! __eou__ Maybe I would talk with him someday . __eou__ I hope it will be of some use . __eou__
I haven ’ t met Bob for years . How is he ? __eou__ He has been keeping bach after divorce . __eou__ He would have recovered from the stress and got married again . __eou__ Once bitten , twice shy . He said he would rather keep bach than to live in disgust . __eou__

Do you know that Mary an Ben have already separated ? __eou__ Yeah , I know . __eou__ I didn ’ t know it until yesterday . I put my foot into it , and was even stupid enough to ask when they would get married . __eou__
Don't you feel a little strange taking the place of your old boss after he was demoted ? __eou__ Yes , at first I felt very awkward . After Bill was demoted and then resigned , it was kind of like somebody died ! I mean the atmosphere in the office was like a funeral parlor or something . And then I was afraid people would look at me as a traitor for filling in his spot when the management asked me to ... __eou__ Did they mutiny ? __eou__ Thankful , no . I guess everyone understands the opportunity I had to step into a leadership role is so great for my career . I'm really moving up the ladder now that I'm considered a supervisor . After a couple weeks , it was like nothing happened . __eou__ It is a really good chance for you to get more exposure at work . supervisors get to take the credit for all the hard work of the people under them . __eou__ Yeah , and they also take the blame , that's what happened to my old boss ... __eou__
You have a lovely house , Jack . __eou__ Thank you . But a number of things have been going wrong lately . __eou__ That's too bad . What problems are you having . __eou__ Oh , the whole house needs re-painting for starters . The carpet in the living room is worn out , and I'd like to put in new wall-to-wall carpeting . Last week , I had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . Anyway , all par for the course when you own a house , I guess . I think I am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over . __eou__ I ’ Ve studied home decoration as a hobby . Could I make some suggestions ? __eou__ Go right ahead . __eou__ Well , I think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room , and maybe some new drapes for the windows . Also , a grandfather clock would look great in the den . Perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room __eou__ Well , you really do have a talent for this , Alice . Thanks for the suggestions . __eou__ You are welcome , Jack . Glad to be of help . __eou__
Did you order the cake ? __eou__ Oh , I forgot . __eou__ Get on the phone right now . It might not be too late . __eou__ I ’ m so sorry ! OK , so you just want a simple message on it . __eou__ Yeah . How about “ Happy Birthday Tony , from the gang . ” __eou__ I ’ m on it ! __eou__

How do I apply to an American university ? __eou__ You should go to the library to find some information about American universities , and write to the Admission Office . Then the Admission Office will send you application forms and other related materials . From experience , many applicants write to several universities instead of just one . __eou__ I was told that it took a lot of time and effort to apply . __eou__ That is true . I ’ ll list for you the requirements of almost all the universities . First of all , you need official transcripts of your undergraduate work , three letters of recommendation from your professors who know your competence , and the official TOEFL ( Test of English as a Foreign Language ) score ( It ’ s usually 550 ) . Then you need a financial guarantee , and an application fee of 25 dollars . __eou__ What's to come next ? __eou__ If they agree to enroll you , they will send you a TAP - 66 Form . With TAP - 66 , you can apply for a passport from our government , and then apply for a visa from the US . Embassy in Beijing . __eou__ How long will it take to go over all the procedures ? __eou__ From 3 to 6 months if everything goes well . __eou__ Thank you . I appreciate your help . __eou__ You are welcome . Please feel free to ask if you have any more questions . __eou__
Mr . Brown , are your children always kicking up a row like this ? I cannot concentrate on my paper . __eou__ Sorry , Mr . Black . I ’ m trying to make them quiet . __eou__ I ’ m afraid if the noise goes on , I shall have no alternative but to leave . __eou__ Sorry , sir . Believe me , everything will be all right . __eou__
Every year , the South has the floods . It is an act of God . __eou__ Do you really think so ? __eou__ Yeah , you have some other ideas ? __eou__ Think , in some way it is an act of God , but in another way , it just is caused by us . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ We didn't pay attention to the environment , cut down trees and polluted the air . __eou__ Oh , I see . Fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things . __eou__
Is there a city where it's always warm ? __eou__ Yes , there are many cities where it's almost always warm.San Diego , for example . __eou__ Are there any other cities where it's always hot ? __eou__ Many.Most of the cities in the southern part of the United States are hot all year . __eou__ But why do so many people live there ? __eou__ Most people grow accustomed to the climate , but there are many others who complain about it all the time . __eou__ Are there any cities where it rains a lot ? __eou__ Several.Two good examples are Seattle , in the state of Washington , and Portland , Oregon . __eou__ Tell us about some cold cities . __eou__ In the north there are many cities which are very cold in the winter.Boston and Chicago are two of them . __eou__ Is it always cold in Chicago and Boston ? __eou__ Oh , no.On the contrary , there are many beautiful days , especially in the spring and fall . __eou__
So how did you meet Bill ? __eou__ I met him through a computer bulletin board . __eou__ Oh , really ? Which bulletin board ? __eou__ It was one I used down at the local coffee house called the San Francisco Net . It's been around since around 1991 . __eou__ I've heard about that , but I've never tried it . __eou__ You ought to . One dollar buys you 15 minutes of computer time . A Chat session links you with cappuccino sippers in other cafes and also to home computers on the network . __eou__ I have no desire to talk on a network with a bunch of strangers . __eou__ That's the whole point . All your inhibitions disappear because you can ’ t see the other person . This network allows you to talk to people whom you normally wouldn ’ t talk to . __eou__ I just want a private conversation with one other person . __eou__ You can do that . A private session lets two people talk alone . This techno-chat program lets you talk about anything with everybody , without prejudice because you can ’ t see them . __eou__ Well , maybe I'll tag along and watch how you talk . __eou__ That's fine with me , but we'll have to get there early . Because after 8 pm , there is always a long line . __eou__ It ’ s that popular ? __eou__ It sure is . __eou__
Wow ! You look like a drowned rat ! Didn't you know there is a thunder-storm today ? __eou__ I knew there would be a shower , but I didn't realize it would rain cats and dogs today . __eou__ Well . You'd better take a hot shower right now , or you will catch a cold . __eou__ I know . I don't want to get sick , especially during finals week . __eou__
Hey man , what do you have on tap ? __eou__ Heineken and Budweiser . We have a two-for-one happy hour special . __eou__ Cool , give me a pint of Heineken and half a pint of Bud . __eou__ Okay ... A pint of Heineken and and half a pint of bud for table six ! And what about some appetizers ? __eou__ Sure ! Let ’ s have some nachos and mozzarella sticks . __eou__ Okay . That ’ ll be 80 bucks . __eou__ Wait ... What ! __eou__
Please point out the painful place with your finger . Is there any relation between the pain and the weather ? __eou__ Yes , the pain comes more intense when the weather is bad . And the pain comes intense when I walk too much . __eou__ Have you ever had any trauma ? __eou__ Yes , I have . __eou__ Does the pian become more intense at night ? __eou__ Yes , ti does . Just like a needle prick . Besides , the place that hurts often feels cold , too . __eou__ Do you have the sensation of ants crawling over the painful part ? __eou__ Yes , I do . __eou__ I'd like to treat you with acupuncture if you agree . __eou__ By the way , does acupuncture hurt ? __eou__ Acupuncture may cause just a little pain , but it also causes a certain feeling of numbness and distension . We'll try it every day for seven days . Will that be all right ? __eou__ Yes . Let's start today . __eou__
Did you see the woman that just left my office ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ She's another applicant , and a leading contender , but I didn ’ t want to hire her . She ’ s qualified , but she doesn ’ t quite fit the profile . We ’ re looking for an accountant , and part of the job requires interacting with clients . Well , our clients want conservative people to handle their money . And green hair with ripped jeans doesn ’ t exactly fill them with trust . __eou__ But it's the style now . __eou__ I realize that , but our business is serving clients and giving them what they want . __eou__ Of course . __eou__ Well , they don ’ t want to deal with people who look like that . They want people who look more like yourself . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ Well , they ’ re older , and they don ’ t understand today's fashions . When they see someone dressed like that , warning bells go off . They don ’ t like that style at all , and they don ’ t like dealing with people who dress like that at work . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__ We used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good , very good . But , the clients reacted very negatively when they saw her . Some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively . __eou__ What happened to her ? __eou__ Well , she was a very good employee and we wanted to keep her , so her supervisor called her in for a chat and laid it on the line for her . She got the idea and now she saves the trendy styles for evenings and weekends . __eou__ I see . __eou__
What kind of character do you think you have ? __eou__ Generally speaking , l am an open-minded person . __eou__ What is your strongest trait ? __eou__ Cheerfulness and friendliness . __eou__ How would your friends or colleagues describe you ? __eou__ They say Mr . Sun is a friendly , sensitive , caring and determined person . __eou__ What personality do you admire ? __eou__ I admire a person who is honest , flexible and easy-going . __eou__ How do you get along with others ? __eou__ I get on well with others . __eou__

Do you understand your rights ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Ok , sign here . __eou__
I wish to make it clear at the outset that this matter of labels is entirely our problem . __eou__ I should say it is something we have never come across before . __eou__ The Federal Food and Drug Administration , or the FDA as we call it for short , imposes a whole set of regulations on the import of food products to the United States . Over the years , they have become so rigid and complicated that they are now quite a head - ache for us importers . __eou__ In my opinion , overly strict regulations are just another way of restricting imports . __eou__ Ah , there's something in what you're saying . According to the present FDA regulations , the Ma Ling Labels then cannot be used if the lichee is to be offered for import into the United States . __eou__ Why not ? Our cannedlichee and canned provisions have already been widely sold in various markets abroad , and the Ma Ling Label has now been accepted by most of overseas customers and importers . Is it quite impossible for you to use the Ma Ling labels as they are ? __eou__ I'd be quite willing to if I could , but we must comply with the label requirements according to our law , or we can't clear the consignment of lichee through the Customs . __eou__ In that case , what can we do to help you ? Have you any suggestions ? __eou__ Would you consider quoting us for the order with neutral cans on a C . I . F . basis for delivery in Hong Kong ? Our associated company there will have the labels printed to comply with the FDA regulations . __eou__ Do you think that's the only way out ? You know we usually do the labeling , as we are responsible for the brand labels of our products . __eou__
What happened to that girl you were seeing ? __eou__ Oh Jackie ? We broke up last week . __eou__ That was a short relationship . You only started dating 2 months ago . __eou__ It was actually a long two months . She was a psycho . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ She would be laughing one moment , and if I said something insensitive , she would start crying . I didn't want to deal with that . __eou__ She sounds very emotional . __eou__ She was a psycho , man . One time we were suppose to get together . I was waiting for her call , and when she finally called , she was screaming why I wasn't at her place . __eou__ Were you suppose to be there ? __eou__ I thought she was going to call when she was done shopping . It was a misunderstanding . She was literally screaming on the phone over this . __eou__ Ok . You're right . She's a psycho . __eou__ I'm just glad it's over . __eou__
Dad , I ’ d like to borrow some money . __eou__ Sure , Johnny , how much do you need ? five bucks ? __eou__ Come on , Dad , I need thirty thousand . I wanna get into the market . You know , I ’ m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . I look at this as an opportunity . This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg . __eou__ I don ’ t know about that ; with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ’ s just too much instability . I wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate . __eou__ But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity . And anyway , I ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example , they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity . __eou__ Come on , son , you ’ re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point . __eou__ Fine , then ! If that ’ s the way you feel , so be it . But you ’ re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ’ m going to go hit up Mum for the cash . __eou__
Fair-Priced Fares , how may I help you ? __eou__ How much is a round-trip ticket to London ? __eou__ When did you plan to go , sir ? __eou__ In the second week of September . __eou__ The second week of September is still in the high-season , so the cheapest tickets are $ 650 . The high season lasts until the 15th , so fares after that date are cheaper . __eou__ In that case , I'll go after the 15th . How much are the off-season fares ? __eou__ Our cheapest ticket is $ 550 on American Airlines . __eou__ Okay , I'll take it . ( to be continued ) __eou__
Ahhchooo ! __eou__ You've been sneezing a lot lately . Are you sick or something ? __eou__ No . Every spring time around April , I'm stricken with allergies . __eou__ I never have seasonal allergies . __eou__ Consider yourself lucky . __eou__ What are all the symptoms ? __eou__ Well , as you just saw , I sneeze a lot . Also , my nose becomes very runny , my throat sometimes itches , and my eyes start to water . __eou__ That doesn't sound good . __eou__ No , it's not . So you don't have any type of allergies ? __eou__ Well , I have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol . It runs in the family . __eou__ Everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol . __eou__ I get it pretty bad . My whole face turns red , including my ears . My eyes become bloodshot , and I start to itch all over my body . __eou__ That's pretty bad . __eou__ But that doesn't stop me from drinking . Ahahah . __eou__
Professor wang can I ask a few questions ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__ What is the tariff ? __eou__ It's a tax levy by the goveroverment on goods imported into that country . __eou__ Why does the government levy the tariff ? __eou__ Tariff provides the government with extra tax revenue . __eou__ Anything else . __eou__ Tariff raises the price at which the goods are sold in the importing country and therefore makes them less competitive with locally produced goods . __eou__ Oh , I know . Thank you . Professor wang . __eou__ Do not mention it . __eou__
A report says running red lights causes one thousand traffic accidents every year . __eou__ It ’ s horrible . Why do drivers run a red light then ? __eou__ Maybe they know they shouldn ’ t run a red light , but when they are driving they don ’ t pay enough attention to traffic lights . __eou__ Talking on the cell phone while driving is very dangerous too . It increases the chance of accidents . __eou__ I know . If a policeman catches you using the cell phone while driving , you will be fined . __eou__
Are you going home now ? __eou__ No , I'm not . __eou__ What are you going to do ? Are you going to work late ? __eou__ No , I'm not . I'm going to look for an apartment . __eou__ An apartment ? Why ? __eou__ I'm going to try to find a place near the office . __eou__ Where are you living now ? __eou__ Out in the suburbs.It ' s a long trip to work every day . __eou__ How are you going to find an apartment ? __eou__ I'm going to buy a newspaper and check the classified ads . __eou__ Apartments in the city are expensive . __eou__ I know , but I'm going to enroll in a night school to take a course in business management . __eou__
Johnny , are you just sitting around again ? __eou__ I'm just taking a break between washing the windows and cleaning the toilet . __eou__ I'd say all you've done is moved the dirt from the windows on to your face and hands .

But he responded by saying'what do you mean ? ' . __eou__ I'm confused . Why did he say that ? __eou__ I felt the same at first . Later he told me that I'd better not give him any suggestions when he was sick . Offering unsolicited help or advice is like showing sympathy to the weak or the poor .

In southern France , one can live in comfort the whole year . Is Japan good for farming ? __eou__ Yes , Japan is good for farming . Rice is the main crop , but Japan is also an industrial center .

We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year . __eou__ Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ? __eou__ Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge .

There has been another murder in the city center . I ’ m shocked that the pole __eou__ people are starting to get frightened by it . Everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder . __eou__ you mean if they catch the murderer . I ’ m scared stiff about going into the city center at night . __eou__ there must have been some good news in the newspaper . I can ’ t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited . __eou__ well , there was one good piece of news . You remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ? __eou__ yes .

We need to do a group report tomorrow . I need to go to the stationer to buy something for the posters . __eou__ You need to make posters ? __eou__ absolutely . Every time when we do the reports , we love making some beautiful posters to emphasize our theme ideas . __eou__ I see . Then let's make a shoppinglIist first before we go there.othe rise , It may take us a whole day to search for the things you need . __eou__ No problem . I need some markers , some color pencils , a pair of scissors , some highlighter , rulers .. __eou__ Wow , it is like a maze , I think I might get lost soon . __eou__ Don't worry.In fact , it is very easy to find what you want .

There are advertisements everywhere here in hong kong . The city is so bright at night , with all the neon signs . __eou__ I like it . It makes the city feel alive . I like all the different colors and I like the billboards with eye-catching pictures and slogans . __eou__ I think that there are too many of them . I think that companies spend far too much money on advertising . They should have lower prices instead . Then they would see more . __eou__ I see your point , but if companies didn ’ t spend money on advertising , no one would hear about their products . I agree that some form of advertising can be annoying . I don ’ t like it when people try to give you leaflets with information about products you have no intention of buying . __eou__ I really hate receiving spam . I also dislike having to listen to advertisements and jingles when they are broadcast in stores or on the subway . __eou__ Yes , that annoys me too . With billboards , you can look away , but with broadcasts , you can ’ t avoid them . I like the way that advertising agencies use comedy in their campaign . __eou__ I like that too . I don ’ t like the way that advertising campaign often tell you if you don ’ t buy a certain product , you ’ re not cool or modern or efficient or something . __eou__ That kind of advertising seems to be very common with brand name products . They are always trying to maintain brand loyalty . __eou__

It's Tracy here , just . __eou__ Okay Tracy , now it's too relaxed ! You've still got to show some respect . How about starting with " Dear Ms . Cooper , I'm writing to confirm ... ? __eou__ Great , okay . " Dear Miss Cooper , I'm writing to confirm the final quotation for the full page back cover color advertisement you requested for the spring issue of Voila magazine " . __eou__ That's great ... __eou__ " The final costing , including advert design and production , comes to forty-five thousand six hundred RIB .

I hate to be the bearer of bad news , but it's that time of year again . Have you got your performance evaluations finished yet ? __eou__ Oh no ! Evaluations ! You can tell that's not my favorite job ; I haven't even started yet . When is the deadline for turning in thecompleted forms ? __eou__ Well , you do still have three weeks . But remember the employee must sign them , too . Filling them in is nothing - it's meetingwith the employees that takes so much time . __eou__ I never know how to rate the employees ' work . Of course attendance and productivity are easy , I just look at the sales figures . __eou__ So it's the subjective criteria like team building and colleague support that you find hard ? __eou__ Exactly ! Attitude ... how do you rate attitude ? __eou__ I suggest letting each employee fill out his or her own evaluation for those items . Then , based on their self - assessment , you can add your comments . It's a great starting point for discussion __eou__ Great idea . And after all , that's the whole point of an evaluation . I almost can't wait to give it a try . __eou__

Why don't you go to an exercise class . __eou__ Yes , maybe I should . __eou__
Who got ripped off ? __eou__ Big time ! A hacker broke into the company's files and got all her personal information . You really think it's completely safe ? __eou__ Well , maybe not 100 percent . I did hear about some tricks people use . __eou__ Now we're getting to the truth . __eou__ There are shills . A shill is someone who bids up the price of their own sale . __eou__ See ? And I bet that's easy to do online . Everybody's anonymous . __eou__

Well , how was the interview ? __eou__ Not too bad , I suppose . __eou__ What did the woman ask you ? __eou__ Oh , she asked me all sorts of questions .

One thing I love our boss for is that he always knows when to give you a pay raise without being asked for . __eou__ Really ? How can he be so sure about the timing ? __eou__ He just knows either by your excellent performance at work or by the annual review . __eou__ Well . This must save lots of employees from worrying about how to write a salary increase letter . You know how tough it is . Do all the employees receive the same pay increase annually ? __eou__ Actually not ! Our company pays for performance . __eou__ I like this system . It will encourage the best employees and motivate those who want to make a change at work . __eou__
Look ! It is not working well . Did you try out the bike when you bought it . __eou__ No , there ’ s no need .

Let's go downstairs and have a look . __eou__ Sure . __eou__ These are the various kinds of packing for pliers . Normally , we have three types of packing __eou__ Oh , the packing looks very nice . __eou__ The skin packing is the most advanced packing for this product in the world market . It catches the eyes and can help push sales . __eou__ Good , what about the export packing ? __eou__ Well , they are packed in boxes of two dozens each , 100 boxes to a wooden case . __eou__ Is the wooden case strong enough for transportation ? You see , 100 boxes of pliers are very heavy . It's about 2,400 kilograms . __eou__ You can rest assured of that . So far , no customers have complained about our outer packing . __eou__ I'm glad to hear that . By the way , do you accept neutral packing ? __eou__ Yes , we can pack the goods according to your instructions . __eou__ Very good . Ok , Mr . Brown , I'm now totally satisfied with your packing . You can execute our first order now , and I will open the L / C immediately after I return to Taipei . __eou__ All right . We'll make the shipment as soon as your L / C is on hand . __eou__
Yes ! I finally lost that last five pounds I've been working on forever ! __eou__ How did you finally do it ? __eou__ A friend suggested that I stop nibbling between meals . __eou__ Like snacking ? __eou__ You know , a little piece of chocolate here , some chips on the side , candy now and then ... __eou__ I get what you mean . __eou__ Instead , I sit down and have a good snack like a piece of fruit between meals . __eou__ I'm impressed .

I had a busy morning . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ I watered all the plants . __eou__ You have a lot of plants . __eou__ Then I did my laundry . __eou__ That takes some time . __eou__ I took the dog for a walk . __eou__ I'll bet he enjoyed his walk . __eou__ I vacuumed the entire house . __eou__ That's a lot of work . __eou__ And then I made lunch . __eou__ I'll bet you were hungry ! __eou__
You seem to be upset . What ’ s eating you ? __eou__ It ’ s because of my son . Dick keeps getting on my nerves __eou__ Dick ? How come ? He used to be as meek as a lamb . __eou__ Yes , he used to be . But now he ’ s drifting off track . __eou__ He must have been in bad company , or he wouldn ’ t be off the beans . __eou__
I'm worrying that she may be lost . __eou__ Be relaxed . She is familiar with the area . __eou__ After all , she is a five-year-old kid . __eou__ Ok , I'll go out and look for her . __eou__
How silly of you to jump out of the window ! __eou__ But that was the first thing that came into my mind when I heard the shout earthquake ! __eou__ Why not use staircases ? The terror was not so violent at that time . __eou__ That would be too late . __eou__ Maybe the situation is too urgent . __eou__ Yes , I think I should have jumped in any case . __eou__
Has the train come yet ? __eou__ No , I ‘ Ve been waiting for ages . __eou__ It ’ s so unreliable . I ’ Ve been late for my meetings all this week . __eou__ Yes , me too .

Bob , you're so lucky that you've come at the right time-the 2005 International Tourism Festival is around the corner . __eou__ We've heard about that festival before . It would be quite helpful if you could give us some highlights of the festival . __eou__ My pleasure . Well , the festival is going to start on the third Saturday of October , and covers over one hundred diverse programs in one month . __eou__ What do you think we can see during the festival ? __eou__ I don't know what to suggest . There're so many attractions , and they all sound interesting . One exciting program might be the Ten Thousand People Cycling round the Town . You can choose from the five routes that lead to different destinations . __eou__ I'd like to take the one that goes to the Wild Animal Park . __eou__ Then you can take Route No . 5 . Next I would suggest the International Dragon Boat Race where you can watch Lion Dance , Dragon Boat racing , and many other water shows . __eou__ Wow , must be interesting to watch dragon boats compete a-gainst one another on the city river . __eou__

Hey , Ben ... did you catch the game last night ? __eou__ Uh ... what game ? __eou__ Baltimore defeated Texas by 17 points ! __eou__ Um ... and what sport are we talking about here ? __eou__ Football of course ! __eou__ Oh ... football . Football is cool . I usually try to catch the World Cup finals . __eou__ No , I'm talking about American football . The World Cup is soccer . __eou__ Oh , I understand . I can't say I'm a big fan . I'm from China , and football doesn't have a really big following over there . __eou__ So Chinese people prefer soccer or basketball ? __eou__ Yes , I think so . But to be perfectly honest , I'm not really a sports nut.When I was in high school I played on the school volleyball team . Are you a diehard football fan ? __eou__ Oh , certainly . I wouldn't miss a game for the world . My girlfriend says I have an addiction . And actually , if I had to choose between her and my games ... I'd probably pick football . __eou__ It seems Americans are very passionate about sports . Is this just a part of your culture ? __eou__ Oh , yeah ! I think the love of sports starts when kids are very young . Americans come from many different backgrounds so I guess sports are something we can all enjoy together . __eou__
Too ... your face is really oily ... perfect ! __eou__ Why ? Are you planning to stir-fry my face ? __eou__ Nope . I'm going to tell your fortune . So ... the oilier , the better . __eou__ You've gone bonkers , Jen . __eou__ It's facial paper , and it fits into the rings of my binder ! It's magical . __eou__ OK . Let's see .

I ’ d really like to try golf , though . __eou__
Hey , Frank , there is that Janet Check . __eou__ Wow , what a great burd ! __eou__ She sure knows how to strut her stuff . __eou__ She's a real turn-on our rights . __eou__ And look out she's dressed . __eou__ Yeah , I noticed . She must be really loaded . __eou__ No way . Her old man is rich . He buys her anything she wants . __eou__ Lucky her . Anyway , I think that is just as beautiful . __eou__ I think you've lost it . __eou__ Well , that's my opinion . __eou__ I admit that she is much prettier than Kate . __eou__ Oh , there is no comparison . Now we are talking but ugly . __eou__ At least we agree on that . Let's go and get a drink . __eou__

With tomorrow being Labor Day and all , I think it would be a nice gesture to let all the members of laboring staff leave work an hour early . What do you say ? __eou__ What ! That sounds perfectly ridiculous ! Labour Day is a holiday for everyone , not just laboring staff ... and we get a whole day off tomorrow anyway , so what's the point of an extra hour tonight ? __eou__ Well , we all get Labour Day off as a holiday , the real purpose of the holiday is to remember all the people who do manual or other hard labor . It's to celebrate those who work doing what other people might not be willing to do . I think we ought to do something in honor of the common worker . __eou__ So if we did allow the laboring force to go home early , how many people are we talking about ? __eou__ In our company , the loborial force makes up 60 % of our workers . We'd just be letting slightly over half the folks out a little early . __eou__
What made you decide on this type of occupation ? __eou__ Oh , to tell you the truth , I love the sky . When I was a child , I imagined flying into the blue sky some day . Now , I think the day has come . My dream will come true . And I like travelling very much and I enjoy working with people . __eou__ Can you make yourself understood in English without too much difficulty ? __eou__ Yes , I think I am quite fluent in English . I got the certificate of the Secondary English Training last month . __eou__ Do you know what the responsibilities are for a stewardess ? __eou__ The main responsibility of the stewardess is to make the passengers relaxed and happy during the flight . And good service is also important . __eou__ Are you in good health ? __eou__ I just had a complete physical examination and I am in top condition . __eou__ Have you had any nursing experience ? __eou__ Yes , I have two years of nursing experience , and now I am working as a nurse in a hospital . __eou__ How tall are you ? What about your eyesight ? __eou__ My height is one meter and sixty-eight centimeters . I've never had any vision problems . __eou__ What would you say are your strengths and weaknesses ? __eou__ One of my strengths is my friendliness and open-minded attitude and also I think I have a warm personality . But sometimes , I find it is hard to tell others when I don't like what they are doing . __eou__ If a passenger can't understand what you say , what should you do ? __eou__ I'll try to speak in another language or I'll try my best to use gestures and draw pictures . __eou__
Hi , buddy ! How do you deal with your salary ? __eou__ I usually put them into my bank account . I think that is a little secure , though the interest rate is low now . __eou__ Look ! This stock is rising now . I am researching it , and planning to buy some shares . __eou__ Have you invested in the stock market before ? __eou__ No . This is my first time to buy some . You can see that its historical price data is rising now . __eou__ But that is a little risky , you know . __eou__ Hey ! Do you still remember our teacher of economics , Mr . Locker ? __eou__ Of course ! I remember he has a part-time job as a stock analyst . __eou__ I can ask for some advice from him . __eou__
I have learnt how to ride a bicycle . I plan to go to the Water Park by bike this weekend . __eou__ Well , you know , the traffic in Beijing is sometimes dangerous .

We'll need balloons for that too . __eou__ Better visit the supermarket then . We'll need some other things for the party . Get some vanilla ice cream , some butter and some vinegar and twelve bottles of beer . __eou__ Okay . The library's beside the baker's . I'd better take back the videos we borrowed last week .

Daniel , look at your left side . Can you see the Air Force Ants ? __eou__ Wow , that's my favorite .

Espresso with water . __eou__ Sounds a little weak . __eou__ Go with a hammerhead then-espresso mixed with drip coffee . __eou__ Sounds better , but I hope it doesn't inspire me to take a hammer to the client's head . __eou__ Don't worry , James . We'll get this case worked out in no time . __eou__
What do we need for the barbecue ? __eou__ Well , I ’ Ve bought a lot of meat . I ’ Ve got pork chops , small steaks , chicken wings and plenty of hot dog sausages and hamburger patties . __eou__ I can ’ t wait to start cooking . I ’ Ve bought the grill and charcoal.Do you have enough plates and utensils ? __eou__ I think so . I bought some paper plates and cups for people to use.It will save on the washing up . __eou__ And if people drop them , they won ’ t break.We ’ ll need to buy some buns to make hot dogs and hamburgers . __eou__ They sell them at the shop around the corner.We can go and get some in a few minutes . __eou__ I brought some cheese to make cheeseburgers and some onions for the hot dogs.We ’ ll need some tomato catchup and some barbecue sauce . __eou__ I have the sauce , but remind me to get some catchup at the shop . __eou__ How long does it take to cook meat on the barbecue ? __eou__ It only takes a few minutes.Some people like their meat well done , others like it rare.The great thing about the barbecue is that everyone can choose how they want their meat cooked . __eou__ They can cook them themselves to make sure exactly how they like it . __eou__ I hope you haven ’ t invited any vegetarians . __eou__

A funny thing happened to me the other day . __eou__ Oh , yes ? __eou__ I was just thinking about someone I went to school with , this boy I was quite friendly with in third grade . We used to hang out together - he lived next door - but then my parents moved and I changed schools and never saw him again . __eou__ Mmm . __eou__ Well , I was walking down Nan Jing Dong Lu ( Nan-Jing E . Rd . ) during my lunch break thinking about this boy-I have no idea why I was thinking about him . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes . And suddenly I heard someone call my name . I turned around and there was this man looking at me . I didn't recognize him at all , but he obviously knew who I was . __eou__ Oh , yeah , that's embarrassing when that happens . __eou__ You got it . Well , he walked up to me and said my name again and then I realized it was the boy I had been thinking about , the one from third grade ! __eou__

There's a great news for our shareholders . __eou__ Yeah , I went over the figures this morning . We're finally started making money again ! __eou__ We've never sold this much before , our growth this year has been phenomenal . We have captured 8 % of the market , up from last year by 120 % . Our strategy is working ! __eou__ not only our annual sales brake a record , but our month by month earnings exceeded our forecast as well . After a two-year slump , we finally back in the black . __eou__ The company's performance has improved since Wallace became president . He's made our little business into a real lucrative operation . Products are selling like hotcakes . __eou__ I think our success is partly because of Wallace's contribution , and partly because of our new marketing strategy . Because of the new advertising campaign , we have become the top sellers in the field . __eou__ Let's hope this stroke of good luck lasts . I hope we are over our financial difficulties for good . __eou__ Let's hope it is ! __eou__
It ’ s so relaxing , taking a walk in the country . The air is so fresh and clean . __eou__ Would you like to live in the country ? I ’ m not sure I ’ d like it . __eou__ I can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage . The problem is that , for me , each advantage has its own disadvantage . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , I hate the noise in the city , but I love being around lost of people . The problem is that you can ’ t have lots of people and have peace and quiet . The tow just don ’ t go together . __eou__ I see what you mean . I love being far away from a city , but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities . __eou__ People can ’ t have it both ways . If you live in the country , it is often less convenient . If you live in a city , it is noisy , buy there ’ s more to do . __eou__ I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams . They ’ re so much better to look at than concrete , rows of parked cars and tall buildings . __eou__ I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face . When the wind blows in the city , you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes . __eou__ The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing . There ’ s so sign of pollution . The village looks so peaceful . __eou__ Just remember that in that village there ’ s nothing to do . There ’ s not even a pub or restaurant . There ’ s just one small shop with a poor selection of goods . __eou__ You ’ re right . I would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends . I would hate living in the country ! __eou__
Have you taken your temperature ? __eou__ Yes , and it is 37 ° C . __eou__ Well , open your mouth and let me have a look . It is nothing serious . You haven't got a fever . But you should take the medicine and need have more rest recently . When you feel well , you could take more exercises , or play sports like basketball , running , and swimming . And eating healthy food , having more fruits and vegetable and drinking milk are good for your heath . __eou__ Yes , I see . Thanks a lot . __eou__
Julie , what's on the tube ? __eou__ nothing but bench of commercials . These days the amount of commercials is amazing . __eou__ yeah . Maybe we can change to another channel . what about the sports channel ? Let's see if there's a game on . __eou__ okay . Nope , it's a replay of yesterday's soccer match between Brazil and Spain . __eou__ it was a good game , but not good enough to watch again . Keep surfing . __eou__ alright . Hmm , this movie is a rerun ... I don't know how many times I've seen this show ... Commercial again ... and a replay of the talk show ... oh no , this show is terrible , you don't wanna watch it . __eou__ oh , what is it ? __eou__ it's a total rip-off of an American reality show , but the imitation is unbearably clumsy . __eou__ oh , I know this kind of shows . Sometimes they really piss me off . If I wanted reality , I'd go outside . __eou__ yeah ... it seems what we have on TV now are either repeats , or commercials , or low-quality shows . There's really nothing to watch . __eou__ I don't get it . We have more than 100 channels and there's still nothing good on ! Maybe we should just turn off the TV , get outside , and do something real . __eou__ cool . __eou__

Check in and check out at the reception only took a few minutes . The wait staff is very good . A waiter recommended their baked fish , which tasted wonderful . The hotel was quite full , so I ’ d suggest making a reservation if you intend to go there . The hotel offers a discount at the weekends . __eou__ It sounds perfect . Did you have any complaints at all ? __eou__ There was a problem with the internet access , so I couldn ’ t check my email , but I didn ’ t complain about it to the management . __eou__ I suppose you were happy to forget about the outside world . __eou__ Yes , I was . Here ’ s their business card . __eou__ Thanks . Was there a mina bar in the room ? __eou__ No , there wasn ’ t . There is a bar on the ground floor and of course you can buy drinks in the restaurant to go with your meal . __eou__ One of the things I dislike about hotels is that everyone expects tips . __eou__ I know . At the inland hotel , they have an interesting policy . When you check out , you put some money in a special box at reception . Each evening , the money in the box is shared equally by the hotel staff . __eou__
I played the video game at Mike's home yesterday . __eou__ What's it like ? __eou__ It's really fantastic . The hero , Super Warrior , is so brave that he can defeat any enemies he meets . He runs through tunnels , swims under water , and climbs over bridges . It's really exciting ! __eou__ And then ? __eou__ I borrowed it from Mike yesterday . Why not have a try ? __eou__ That's neat ! __eou__
What did you buy at the market ? __eou__ I bought some special local products . __eou__ You seem to have bought the whole market ! __eou__ Yes . I really wanted to do so . I love those handicrafts , especially the paper-cut . __eou__ Paper-cuts are all hand-made . Let me see the paper-cuts you bought . They are all animals . __eou__ Aren't animals the main content of Chinese paper-cuts ? __eou__ All right . Animals , especially Chinese zodiac , are the most common theme in paper-cuts . But there are other themes . __eou__ Then I will buy some tomorrow . __eou__ Why do you want to buy so much ? __eou__ Because I want to send them to my friends . __eou__ I see . __eou__
But this place doesn't feel like a forty-ping apartment . __eou__ Well , it's forty pings including the balcony . See . It's huge . __eou__ Oh ! The view is great ! Mountains , fresh air ! Stars ? __eou__ This balcony is perfect for barbecuing . __eou__ And we could get a dog ! __eou__ I'm sorry . No pets are allowed in this apartment building , except fish . __eou__ Well , fish it will be then . __eou__
Hey , Susan . Have you got a sec ? I have some questions about my paycheck . __eou__ You bet , Emily . Pull up a chair . __eou__ Well , this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand . First of all , what is this FICA , and SUI Y tax , and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan ? __eou__ OK , let's start from the top of your pay stub . This number here represents your gross pay . __eou__ Then here we have a series of deductions . First off are the federal ones . FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act , or something like that . It's your federal income tax . And then there's Social Security and Medicare , which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work . __eou__ All right , I see . So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now . __eou__ That's right . Below the federal deductions are the state deductions . There's the state income tax , and then this SUI / SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up , but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take . __eou__ Yeah , I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that . So there are two separate income taxes — one at a state level and one at a federal level ? __eou__ That's right . Not all states have an income tax . Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead . __eou__ I see . All right , well I think everything else I can figure out on my own . The deductions for health insurance and my 401 ( K ) are pretty self-explanatory . Thanks for your help , Susan . __eou__ No problem ! All those deductions do add up , and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like . I can understand why you'd want some explanation . __eou__ Yeah , I guess it's the same in the UK , I just never paid much attention . See you later ! __eou__
You'd better prepare for the examination . __eou__ I don't think the exam will be very hard . __eou__ You should change your attitude , or you will not pass the course . __eou__ Maybe you're right . I have been too lazy lately . __eou__
Whip me if I get below 80 marks out of 100 ! __eou__ Take it easy , Jim . Your mother didn't mean it ! Need any help ? __eou__ Yes . Can you help me remember how to spell ' beautiful ' ? __eou__
I am trying to decide what school to apply to ? __eou__ Are you thinking about a public school or a private one ? __eou__ I am not sure . What's the difference between them ? __eou__ Public schools are usually state funded , whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere . __eou__ Which is better ? __eou__ One isn ’ t necessarily better than the other . It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers . __eou__ I hear you have to wear uniforms at private school . __eou__ Yes , sometimes . __eou__
Alice , I never knew you had such a lovely voice . You really can sing , can't you ? __eou__ Thanks , Mark . I used to be a member of the school choir . __eou__ No wonder you can control your voice so well . You are a professional singer . __eou__ Well , you are flattering me . I wouldn't say I am a professional , but I did receive some training at school . My music teacher used to be a professional singer . __eou__ Well , a good teacher makes good students . __eou__ You are quite right . __eou__
Every teacher likes him . __eou__ They say he can sum up like winking . __eou__ How he manages to do that is always a mystery to me . __eou__ Maybe he's gifted in that . __eou__
This shirt you gave me is not my favorite brand . __eou__ Don't look a gift horse in the mouth ! That was the best they had . __eou__
I wish I could unsay the sharp words to him . He must hate me very much . __eou__ He doesn't mind . As a matter of fact , he's very pleased . __eou__ Really ? Oh , thank Goodness ! __eou__
Mom , did you feel the earthquake this afternoon ? __eou__ Oh , that scared me . __eou__ The breaking news just reported some houses were destroyed by the earthquake . __eou__ Oh , dear ! How ruthless ! __eou__ Do you think we can donate some clothes and food for the victims ? __eou__ Why not ? That's a good idea to help them . __eou__
Do you have any year-end benefits ? __eou__ I don ’ t know till now . __eou__ I just saw a piece of news , that a group of white color workers hold a flour war in the office because of dissatisfaction of the year-end benefits . __eou__ Why they hold a flour war ? __eou__ They got rice , flour and oil as presents , while the leadership got 1000 yuan shopping card . __eou__ They are not feeling satisfied ? __eou__ It is said that the presents they got value less than 200 yuan , and it is no use for them at all , because they don't cook by themselves . __eou__ But how guilty to waste food ! __eou__
Now I know why I split up with Mike . We found we were simply not good for each other . __eou__ In what ways ? __eou__ Well , he is a typical Sagittarius guy , while I am a Cancer . We aren't really compatible __eou__ Ha-ha , so you believe in astrology ? __eou__ What's strange about that ! As a person born under the sign of Cancer , I am home-loving and wish for a peaceful family life . But according to astrology , Sagittarius guys are too adventurous and risk-taking.They seldom think of leading a settled and peaceful life . __eou__ Is that so ? I'm afraid it is too narrow-minded to judge people using astrology . It's all stereotypes ! __eou__ But in my case , the fact matches the theory . Mike is humorous , energetic , always as fresh as a daisy , but probably too ambitious . It frightens me ! __eou__ But as far as I remember , you two caught on like a house on fire when you first met . __eou__ Exactly . But later on , he cares more about his career than love . Work seems to be the better all , and all for him-so much that he doesn't even grudge sparing a day out with me . __eou__
My wife is really a chatter box . It ’ s so boring . __eou__ I have an idea . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ You just turn a deaf ear when she talks . __eou__
I want to give our kitchen the works . __eou__ Why ? I think it ’ s convenient and good . __eou__ No . The decoration has been out-of-date . My friends have a whole kitchen now . It ’ s modern . __eou__ Why should we run after the fashion ? __eou__ I am not running after the fashion . I just want a very beautiful and clean kitchen . __eou__
When I was a little boy , I had a dream of becoming a lawyer . __eou__ Your dream comes true now . __eou__ Yes , I knew I would make it . __eou__ You are really confident . __eou__
Hey Susan , what are you coming as this year ? __eou__ Coming as ? __eou__ Yeah ... for Halloween ! We have a big office party tomorrow evening . There's a prize for best costume ! __eou__ Um ... I have to confess , I haven't given it much thought . I'm from China and Halloween really isn't celebrated there . __eou__ Really ! You don't have some kind of Chinese ghost festival ? __eou__ Oh ... Sure . We have an entire month ! In traditional Chinese culture , Ghost Month is a period when the door between this world and beyond opens up and ghosts come back to earth for a visit . __eou__ Cool ! A whole month ! What do you do during that month ? __eou__ Well , people sometimes set off firecrackers , some people burn paper money as an offering and many people go to a temple to burn incense.Mainly though , you need to feed the ghosts because they're hungry . __eou__ Feed them ? __eou__ Yeah ... we set up tables with food , fruit and drinks and offer that to the hungry ghosts . __eou__ And then later everyone eats the food ? __eou__ Yes ! How did you guess that ? __eou__ It makes sense , right ? Who else is going to eat it ? __eou__ Good Point ! __eou__ But no dressing up like ghosts , right ? __eou__ No ! So ... is Halloween essentially the same thing as ghost month ? __eou__

Good morning , everybody . Welcome to IAM Technology . I'm very pleased so many of you could make it here today . My name's Sam Weiss . I'm the Production Manager .

I decided to change the situation as soon as possible . Otherwise I will be more regretful later . __eou__ This is encouraging news , good for you !

It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place . __eou__ Sounds not bad ! Better performance isn ’ t just about doing a lot more .

Hello sir , how may I help you ? __eou__ I would like to buy some flowers , please . Something really nice . __eou__ I see , may I ask what the occasion is ? __eou__ It ’ s not really an occasion , it ’ s more like I ’ m sorry . __eou__ Very well.This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness . __eou__ I think I ’ m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . What else do you recommend ? __eou__ Mmm , well this is our I ’ m sorry I cheated on you package . Two dozen red roses lined with tulips , carnations and lilies . The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you . __eou__ I don ’ t think that ’ s gonna cut it .

I really think all Americans look alike . __eou__ You ’ re crazy ! You haven ’ t been here long enough . __eou__ But they do . __eou__ What makes you say that ? __eou__ They wear the same clothes , they ’ re all blond , they all drive cars , they all own Parker fountain pens ; they all drink Coca Cola , and they all chew gum . __eou__ I disagree with you . They don ’ t all wear the same clothes ; they ’ re definitely not all blond ; they don ’ t all own Parker fountain pens ; they don ’ t all drink Coca Cola , and they don ’ t all chew gum . I do think they all drive cars though ! But that doesn ’ t have anything to do with how they look ! __eou__ Maybe I am just homesick . I know you ’ re right . I just miss China , that ’ s all . __eou__
... Now that we have been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter , Ed ! Give us some good news . How are things looking for us in terms sales this month ? __eou__ Uh well ... would you like the bad news first or the really bad news ? __eou__ What ? Ed , don ’ t tell me you only have bad news ! __eou__ Well sir , our sales have dropped , no plunged , fifty percent in the past month alone . We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits refalling fast . The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory , or getting rid of our staff . If we consider redundancies , it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages . It ’ s a real mess . __eou__ For crying out loud ... How fast are we losing money ? __eou__ Um ... how can I put this ? Let ’ s just say that at this pace , we will be filing for Chapter eleven in less than three months . __eou__ What ! Geez ! How could this have happened ? So what ’ s the bad news ? __eou__ Oh , that ’ s the really bad news . Our supplier suffered QC problems and , well , half of our production is faulty . We ’ re going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter . And the worst part ? We ’ re going to have to shoulder this cost . __eou__ Are you joking ? Get the supplier on the line now ! They have to assume the costs of this mess ! __eou__ We tried that , sir . The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country . __eou__ We ’ re doomed ! __eou__ There is some really good news though ! __eou__ Really ? What ! __eou__ I got offered a new job ! __eou__

I missed being a target of a lot of jokes by one day . I guess I am lucky , too ! __eou__ That is true ! Here , have some Granola for breakfast . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ After eating , we will take down our tent . Then we will pack everything into the canoe , We can shove off by 6 __eou__ I guess so . __eou__ How about going for swim around 10 __eou__ That should work out great . You are miracle worker ! You have got me awake and motivated . __eou__ Happy Independence Day ! __eou__
It's really late but I'm starving . __eou__ Hey , that coffee shop's lights are still on . __eou__ Maybe they have some good pie . __eou__ I would love a really sticky cinnamon bun . __eou__ There was a coffee shop by my house when I was a kid that served cinnamon hot chocolate . __eou__ Mmmm . That sounds like something I had in Mexico once . __eou__ Good stuff ... Oh , no . The door is locked . __eou__ Ohhhhh ! And I just got all my juices going ! __eou__
How did you spend the weekend ? __eou__ I went to a movie with my boyfriend . __eou__ Really ? How was it ? __eou__ It was great . The director took a lot of care while framing . They say be has good chance at winning the Oscar for best director . Also I like the actors , some really great new young actors . __eou__ Oh , yeah ? What's it about ? __eou__ Well , it's the classic love story between two people from conflicting backgrounds . But besides a beautiful story , the cinematography is great . There is some really dramatic footage . It's really quite a visual feast . And the soundtrack is moving . __eou__ Sounds pretty good . Is it a tragedy ? __eou__ The ending is a bit of a surprise . I don't want to ruin it for you . __eou__ Oh , I like movies with surprise endings , although , sometimes they can be frustrating . Maybe I should invite my girlfriend to go next weekend . __eou__ It would be a really good choice . The movie is very suitable for lovers to see together . I'm sure you won't regret it . __eou__
What are you doing tonight ? __eou__ I have to run to the grocery store . __eou__ Don't you hate fighting the crowds on the weekends ? __eou__ Yes , but I am out of food and milk . __eou__ What store do you shop at ? __eou__ The small one , just down the street . I like their generic brand . __eou__ I have been using the store across town for years . __eou__ I hear they have very nice stuff . __eou__ They do , but they're a little expensive on certain items . __eou__ Well , you should try my store . The prices are good . __eou__ I will sometime . Thanks for the advice . __eou__
What ’ s the area of your country ? __eou__ It ’ s not very big . It ’ s a little over half a million square kilometers . __eou__ That sounds quite big ! How many people live there ? __eou__ There are about 30 million people in my country . Most of them live in the north . __eou__ What ’ s the average income ? __eou__ That ’ s the really hard to say . I think most people earn about two thousand dollars a month , if you convert the money from our currency into dollars . __eou__ So your country is fairly rich . __eou__ I think we are richer than most countries , but not as rich as countries in western Europe . Our biggest problem at the moment is unemployment , which is roughly 8 % . It has doubled over the last four years . __eou__ Unemployment in my country is a fraction of that . __eou__
For our lunch meeting with the investors , do we have to make a reservation at the restaurant or do we just show up ? __eou__ Usually for lunch , we don't have to reserve a table , they should allow walk-ins . But to be on the safe side , I'll order a table for half-past twelve . Will that suit your schedule ? __eou__ I've arranged to meet them at the restaurant at twelve . Can you make the reservation a little earlier ? If we start earlier , it will give us more time for a longer lunch . __eou__ Are you planning on treating the investors to a full-course meal ? __eou__ Yes , we'll start with appetizers , follow with a soup and salad course , then main dishes of prime rib or cordon bleu chicken , and finish up with a delicious rich dessert of some sort . __eou__ That'll be pretty heavy for a mid-day meal , don't you think ? __eou__ As along as we stay away from anything alcoholic , we should be okay . __eou__ With your prime rib and chicken choices , you'd better hope nobody's vegetarian . __eou__ We can make some special arrangement if we need to . After all , it's the company who is footing the bill . __eou__
Here ’ s your hot dog and beer . What happened ? Did I miss anything ? __eou__ Yeah , Cal Ripen just hit a home run . __eou__ What ’ s the score ? __eou__ Well it was 3 to 4 , but Ripen ’ s home run made it 5 to 4 since another player was on first base . __eou__ So Baltimore is winning ? __eou__ Right . __eou__ This is a really great place to watch a baseball game . __eou__ Yeah , there isn ’ t a bad seat in the place . __eou__ The fans are great here , too . Not like in Philadelphia . __eou__ It was a great idea to spend a day watching a game . __eou__ Yeah , it reminds you why they say baseball is America ’ s favorite pastime . __eou__
Welcome , sir . May I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I wanna go to America for my vacation . __eou__ No problem . Actually , we have some great packages . The most exciting season of Hawaii is now . How about a relaxing vacation in Hawaii ? __eou__ Sounds good . Are there any group tours I can go with ? __eou__ Yes . There will be one at the end of this month . For many people , a Hawaiian vacation promises languid days filled with sunbathing and poolside cocktails . For others , it ’ s all about non-stop action in one of the world's most extreme natural playgrounds . Whether you are in search of quiet relaxation or unbridled stimulation , Hawaii gives you the best of both . __eou__ Great . So how long is the trip ? __eou__ 15 days . The transportation by air will take five days . __eou__ Fine . I happen to have 20 days for holiday , so exciting ! How many places will be visited and what are they ? Where will be staying and how about the food there ? __eou__ Sir , let's do it step by step . First , we will visit over 25 different places . Most of the places are in Hawaii ’ s Big Island . We will stay in Arlott ’ s Lodge __eou__ Well , cool . What's the price for this trip ? __eou__ Well , right now there's a special rate for 40,000 RIB for this package , including everything such as airline ticket , tour guides , hotels and food . All you have to do is to sign up and we will take care of everything . __eou__ Well . 40,000 RIB that's really a lot of money . I will have to think about it . __eou__ Sure . By the way , this special price is only good through the end of the week . __eou__ Is it Thursday ? I mean if I let the chance slide ... __eou__ Yes , sir . It will be a great pity ! __eou__ Well . Ok , I will take it . __eou__ Thank you ! __eou__
Okay , well I ’ m sure you have a number of questions to ask me regarding the position . __eou__ Yes , well Miss Childs did give mean overview of the position over the phone , but there were some details I ’ d like to clarify . __eou__ Well feel free to ask me anything , and I ’ ll try to fill in the details . __eou__ Could I first ask about the remuneration package ? __eou__ Yes , of course . That's quite an important point , isn ’ t it ? As a junior sub editor we offer a starting salary of 150,000 HK dollars per annum . This doesn ’ t include a generous housing allowance al __eou__ I understand . And are there other bonuses included ? __eou__ Well , apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers . But we could go through all the details of that at a later date . __eou__ Well , Mr . Parsons , I am flexible when it comes to salary . The opportunity to work in Hong Kong for you is the most important thing for me . __eou__ Excellent.Well , what other questions do you have Rebecca ? __eou__
Morning , Peter . Nice suit ! A new one ? __eou__ Oh , yes . My wife bought it for me yesterday . Hmm , you look nice in that yellow dress . Yellow suits you really well . __eou__ Maybe . Several people have suggested that I get more yellow clothes . They say the color suits me because I have a fair complexion . __eou__ That's right . You know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . Actually , I think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . It's just that different colors can give people different impressions . For example , black could make you look mature , while pink could make you look young and energetic . __eou__ Thank you for your compliments . It sounds like you're a clothing expert . __eou__ Well , compared with my wife , I'm just a beginner . __eou__
Earning extra income on the Internet is easier than you might think . After I started selling traditional craft items on the Internet last year , I have really been able to make bank doing something I love . __eou__ Is that right ? I hear all these horror stories of internet business crashing because there is not enough of a customer base yet . How can you be sure your idea will cash in ? __eou__ To run a successful internet business , it requires a little research and relatively small investment . You've got to have a good idea of some kind of product that is in demand or would be popular . __eou__ That's marketing research ... But what about getting started once you have an idea ? __eou__ After you have your great idea , then you can set up shop by registering a domain name , creating a website , an email address , and a hosting service . If you want to go all out on your website , you can put together shopping cart technology , but that can be pricey to start out with . __eou__ Sounds like a lot of work ! __eou__ Anything worth doing takes work . Money doesn't grow on trees ... Most of us have to work for it . __eou__

I was just ready for something new . __eou__ I see . Do you want to work full-time or part-time ? __eou__ I would rather work full-time . __eou__ I'll make note of that . Now , what are your salary expectations ? __eou__ I am willing to negotiate , but I expect at least $ 40,000 a year . __eou__
Can you manage chopsticks ? __eou__ Why not ? See . __eou__ Good mastery . How do you like our Chinese food ? __eou__ Oh , great ! It's delicious . You see , I am already putting on weight . There is one thing I don't like however , MSG . __eou__ What's wrong with MSG ? It helps to bring out the taste of the food . __eou__ According to some studies it may cause cancer . __eou__ Oh , don't let that worry you . If that were true , China wouldn't have such a large population . __eou__ I just happen to have a question for you guys . Why do the Chinese cook the vegetables ? You see what I mean is that most vitamin are destroyed when heated . __eou__ I don't know exactly . It's a tradition . Maybe it's for sanitary reasons . __eou__
That'll be eight dollars , please . __eou__ Here's ten . Keep the change . __eou__
What do you do besides work and watching TV ? __eou__ When I have some time , I like to exercise . __eou__ Do you go jogging or do you go to a health club ? __eou__ I joined Samsung Health Club a couple of months ago . __eou__ How do you exercise ? __eou__ I usually spend 30 minutes on the bicycle for the Carpio , and then I lift weight for about 45 minutes . __eou__ How often do you go ? __eou__ I want to go four times a week , but I'm too lazy . Last week , I only went to workout once . __eou__

Say away ! __eou__ Her standard for selecting life partner is a little higher . I can not accept that . __eou__ What did she say ? __eou__ She said she want a man with large house , luxurious car and healthy parents . __eou__ Give her up . __eou__
It seems like it rains every time we plan a picnic . __eou__ Well , that's life . __eou__

Do you consider yourself a good mother ? __eou__ Yes , I'm a very good mother and successful career woman . __eou__ How can you manage to do both ? I mean , it is so hard to be a working mother . __eou__ I think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself , like keeping housework simple , spending money on things that make life easier , buying yourself things you like , and so on . You can only be nice to others when you can be nice to yourself . __eou__ Does your husband feel the same ? __eou__ Yes . He is very understanding and supportive . __eou__
I know you have a son . How old is he ? __eou__ He's going to turn six next month . __eou__ Who is looking after him ? __eou__ My mother-in - law . She retired last year . __eou__ You really are lucky ! __eou__ Yeah , I know . __eou__
Actually the general manager is regarded as a baby doll . He has much sympathy . __eou__ That's right . And his wife is a baby doll , too . She used to have many followers . __eou__ Were you one of them ? __eou__ Nothing of the sort . I can't hold a candle to her . __eou__

I can even touch my toes ! __eou__ Can you do the vault ? __eou__ I do back flips at the pool all the time . __eou__
Which season do you like best ? __eou__ I like spring best . It is neither too cold nor too hot . Freezing days make me lazy and stuffy days make me lazier . How about you ? __eou__ I prefer summer , especially the summer evenings . When the sun comes down , it is so nice to take a walk and breathe . After a rain shower , the smell of the air is refreshing . It is also a best reason for ice-cream . __eou__ How do you get through the stuffy daytime ? __eou__ Well , I have to hide in the air-conditioned rooms . Anyway , it is all worth , just think about the cool evening time . __eou__

X , E , R , 3 , a question mark , and I can ’ t quite make out the other symbol but I think it ’ s the peace sign . __eou__ Wow , Arthur !

Where on earth are we going to borrow at 3 % ? __eou__ We can borrow from a bank , the gross interest rate will be something like 7 % . With corporate tax at say 30 % . We are only paying on 50 % of this . There is still inflation to consider . __eou__ You can knock off another 2 % for that . __eou__ We can borrow as much as we can . __eou__ Not quite , if we get too heavily in debt , the shares will tend to drop . __eou__ How much loan capital can we safely raise then ? __eou__ I would like to have notice of that question , I will give you an answer in a week . __eou__
Dave , there's something I want to talk to you about . __eou__ Zina , why are you whispering ? __eou__ I've been talking to WebTracker . I'm thinking of jumping ship . __eou__ What ?

And watch your back . Elvin is still mad about his nose . __eou__ OK , but don't tell anyone what I said . __eou__
Good morning.Are you Mr.Liu ? __eou__ My name is Liu Lichi . How do you do ? __eou__ How do you do ? Please be seated , How is your trip here ? __eou__ Quite good , I think . I came here by bus , and it took me about 15 minutes . __eou__ Oh , yes.How old are you ? __eou__ Twenty . __eou__ Hum , still a student ? __eou__ Yes , I'm student of grade 3 in the university majoring in economics . __eou__ What subjects are you studying ? __eou__ English , math , commercial and legal studies , and accountancy . __eou__ Have you had any working experience . __eou__ Well , I worked at a supermarket during last summer holidays . __eou__ What do you like to do in your spare time ? __eou__ I like sports very much.Besides that , I also like working on a computer in my spare time . __eou__ How are your English and computer skills ? __eou__ I have passed the CET - 4 and 6.As far as computer is concerned I can use the computer for word processing . __eou__ Okay . Mr.Liu , we'll inform you of the results within a week . __eou__
Could you do something to advance your shipment ? __eou__ It's hard to say . But why ? __eou__ We expect the goods to be on the market before the end of December to catch up with the Spring Festival sales . __eou__ I can understand your position .

Please tell us the exact time when the big fire broke out . __eou__ The exact time ? Let me think . You know , it happened at night . __eou__ But we need the exact time . What time ? __eou__ Oh , I remember . It was about 10 o'clock . When I was about to go to bed , suddenly I heard help outside . __eou__
I am very interested in a new apartment near the Taxing Plaza , but the price is very high , I really can't afford it . __eou__ How much is it for each square meter ? How large is the apartment ? __eou__ It's 7500 yuan per square meter , and I really like the one with three bedrooms and a large living room . Its total area is about 80 square meters . __eou__ That surely will cost you a lot of money . Are you going to make a full payment ? __eou__ Do you think I am rich enough to make it ? I am thinking about buying the apartment by installments . The real estate agency says if I pay a 25 % down payment , I can move in at once . __eou__ If sounds so tempting . Why not go applying for a loan from the bank ? They charge very low interest , so you can choose whether to pay up the balance in 10 or 20 years . __eou__
You like movies ? __eou__ Yeah , I think it's the best way to relax . __eou__ What type do you like the best ? __eou__ Really it depends on my mood . When I am sad or depressed , I like comedies . If I'm feeling good , I'll watch almost anything . __eou__ I see . I generally like movies to help calm me down . I think a sign of a good movie is the ability to bring you into the story as if you were part of it . __eou__ Yeah , unfortunately , nowadays directors are often more interested in making money than making a good film . __eou__ True . The movie industry is becoming more and more commercial . You see a lot of expensive movies with little artistic value . I generally think those made in the forties are of higher quality on the average than movies today . You can name a lot of classics from that decade . __eou__ Yeah , many of my all-time-favorites were made in the forties . They've already stood the test of time and will stay with us for a long time . __eou__ I'm totally with you on that . __eou__
Thank you.Steven.That was the most magnificent meal I've had abroad.You ' ll have to let me reciprocate the next time you're in Beijing . __eou__ Don't worry about it , Lin.That ' s no big deal.You know , Americans appreciate China's rich culinary culture . Just excuse me for a second while I check the number here and figure out how much to give the waiter.Hmm , by the way , what do you do about tipping in China ? __eou__ We don't . __eou__ No tipping ? Now that's what I call a civilized system . __eou__ At hotels and some restaurants they add a service charge to the bill , but other than that , tipping isn't customary . __eou__ What about cab drivers and porters ? __eou__ In a cab you just pay what it says on the meter . I generally tip hotel porters 10 yuan per bag , but in first-class hotels they're instructed not to accept gratuities . __eou__ You'd have a revolution on your hands if you tried to introduce that sort of system here . __eou__
Where did you get all these barney tour pamphlets ? __eou__ I took them from a travel agency . Look at those nice pictures , lash forest , palm fringed , white sand beaches , crystal blue ocean , they ’ re breath-taking . It is like paradise on earth . __eou__ That ’ s why it ’ s become a very popular holiday destination these years . Someone told me the service there is very good too . Are you planning to spend the holiday there ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m thinking about signing up for a tour in the travel agency . Their next tour starts the same time as my holiday does next month . __eou__ How many days is the tour ? __eou__ 10 days . When I get back , I still have two days to go before work . Isn ’ t that great ? __eou__ That ’ s a perfect plan . Enjoy yourself . __eou__
Egg , this bathroom is a pigsty ! __eou__ Helen , why do you keep flushing the toilet ? What's wrong ? __eou__ I just can't stand it . It's really gross in here ! There ' s a stain on the toilet seat , and the floor was wet and slippery . So I cleaned it ! __eou__ You did what ? Helen , I know it's gross , but I ' Ve seen many public washrooms that are much worse . Why are you cleaning the counter top ? are you out of your mind ? __eou__ I can't help myself ; it's just so disgusting in here ! __eou__ Helen , this is not like your own bathroom . Just leave it to the cleaners , okay ? __eou__ Hang on . I'm just gonna quickly wipe the sink and sweep the floor . __eou__ You're such a neat freak ! I'm outta here ! __eou__
Who is it ? __eou__ Supervisor . Open the door . __eou__ Wait a sec . __eou__ What are you doing here ? __eou__ We're watching a football match . What's the matter ? __eou__ Your neighbors complained that you were so noisy that they can't sleep . __eou__ I'm sorry about this . __eou__ Please turn down the TV . And not another shout or I'll have to report you to the school administration . __eou__ You can rest assured that we won't disturb others anymore . __eou__
How did your vacation go ? __eou__ I traveled the Three Gorges . __eou__ What about the trip ? Do you enjoy yourself ? __eou__ Yes , we had a good time . The trip was terrific . We toured the Three Gorges by boat . Its realty exciting ! __eou__ Did your boat float down the river ? __eou__ Yes . There are many places where the gorge is very narrow , with steep cliffs on both sides . __eou__ Sounds dangerous . __eou__ Yes , but we have life jackets . And we got a real kick out of that . __eou__ What a thrilling trip ! __eou__
Do you like swimming ? __eou__ Yes . Swimming is one of my most favorite sports , indoors or out-doors . __eou__ Me too . Swimming is a very good exercise for health . It combines water , bath , sunbath , and air bath together . It promotes the growth and haleness of muscles , bone , viscera and nerve systems . __eou__ I have never thought that swimming can bring us so many benefits . I only know that swimming in great waves and deep running water can train people's spirits , and enable people to be fearless of the hardships , dangers and difficulties and become brave and staunch . __eou__ Have you ever swum in a river or a lake ? __eou__ Yes , but not always . However , I won't let it go if I have a chance . __eou__
Can you believe me ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Please count on my love . __eou__ I will . __eou__ I'll be yours through endless time . __eou__ I see . And I'll always be devoted to you . __eou__ Thank you . I know I've nothing to offer you , but I'll never give you reason to cry . __eou__ I'll never hurt you ; I'll never lie . __eou__ My love will grow , like a river to flow . __eou__ It can't be dry , and can't die . __eou__ I don't know whether we are in a dream . __eou__ Aha , Aha ... __eou__
Your house is too small . Why not buy a big one . __eou__ I do wish I could afford one . __eou__ You can get a loan from the bank . You know LPF program provides low cost loans for participants home purchases . __eou__ Of course I know that . But don't you notice that the house price is skyrocketing ? __eou__
Well , humans could never make something like that . __eou__ Those poor Egyptians slaves worked so hard and you want to give aliens all the credit ! __eou__ Be a little more open-minded , Stu ! Don't believe everything you read in your history books ! __eou__ OK , but don't believe everything you see on The X-files , either ! __eou__ Speaking of The X-files , it's on right now ! __eou__
Do you think that climate change is responsible for the recent floods ? __eou__ It could be . There are floods in this country almost every year , but in recent years they have been more widespread and more frequent . __eou__ It seems that the climate in this country is changing . __eou__ The summers are hotter . The last three summers have been the hottest for the past 200 years . There have also been stronger winds . __eou__ I think that the changing climate is a sign that we are causing too much damage to the environment . __eou__ I think you ’ re right . Climate change naturally over time , but I think that human activities are speeding up the change . I wish that government would join together and try to resolve the problem . __eou__ Me too . If we don ’ t do something soon , It might be too late . __eou__
I am glad to meet you , Mr.Joey . __eou__ Hello , Mr . lie . I would like to discuss with you the feasibilities of establishing a joint venture with your company . __eou__ That is excellent , your investment proposal is a wise decision . May I have some idea of your suggestion ? __eou__ I suggest that we set up a board of directors for the management of the company and share rights and obligations as equal . That is very important . __eou__
When you were in school , what were your favorite subjects ? __eou__ I enjoyed everything , as long as I was learning . __eou__ Still , you must have had some subjects you enjoyed more than others . __eou__ Yes , I did like Spanish and Music . But I don't remember much Spanish . __eou__ That's too bad . We could really use someone who is bilingual . __eou__ If you hire me , I'll start studying Spanish again . __eou__
Did you work in a charity organization ? __eou__ Yeah , I had been in the charity organization for 2 months and I learned a lot from that experience , including love , sympathy , equality , and so on . __eou__ In what way did those social activities have impact on your mind ? __eou__ I think it had direct impact on my way of thinking . I learned to look at people and things from an overall perspective . In that case , I am not easy to be edgy . __eou__
Where can I find information on this subject ? __eou__ I'm not sure . Let's look up the catalogue . __eou__ Will you give some advice on this experiment ? __eou__ I advise that step be taken in power supply first . __eou__ What's his suggestion for this work ? __eou__ His suggestion is that the work be started at once . __eou__ The way I see it is that they'd join us . __eou__ I think so too . __eou__
Gordon , you're ever so late . __eou__ Yes , I am sorry . I missed the bus . __eou__ But there's a bus every ten minutes , and you are over 1 hour late . __eou__ Well , I missed several buses . __eou__ How on earth can you miss several buses ? __eou__ I , ah ... , I got have late . __eou__ Oh , come on , Gordon , it's the afternoon now . Why were you late really ? __eou__ Well , I ... I lost my wallet , and I ... __eou__ Have you got it now ? __eou__ Yes , I found it again . __eou__ When ? __eou__ This morning . I mean ... __eou__ I am not convinced by your explanation . __eou__
Hi , Dave . You're early . __eou__ So you knew it was me ? __eou__ I had an idea . __eou__ Look , before we get into the secret admirer thing , I want to talk to you about WebTracker . __eou__ I'm sorry . I know you feel betrayed . __eou__ So you're really planning to quit invoking and switch over to WebTracker ? __eou__ My mind is made up . __eou__
How long have you been in this company ? __eou__ I came two years ago after I graduated from college . This is my first job . __eou__ You must have found much difference between working in company and studying in college . __eou__ Of course ! Everyday , there is a deadline to meet . Bosses watching and testing me all the time , not liking in college , handed in paper months later and tested on schedule . It is so busy . But anyway , I have been trying my best to be a good employee . __eou__ Well , you ’ Ve adapted yourself very well . Everyone in our office thinks you ’ Ve made a great progress in the past two years . What is your secret ? __eou__ It is so encouraging to hear this remark . The secret is to make plans . Write down your goals , short-term and long-term and make detail plans for a week or a month . Then just work hard . __eou__
John ? I have to say I was bothered by the way you handled the meeting today . __eou__ How so ? I thought it went fine . __eou__ I think it would have been better if you had given us more of a chance to give our opinions . __eou__ I ’ m sorry . I thought we were all pretty much in agreement . __eou__
What are your terms of payment ? __eou__ Our terms are net 30 . __eou__ What if we purchase an increased quantity ? Can you give us better terms ? __eou__ You would have to order in excess of 10,000 units to be eligible . __eou__ We do not have the space in our warehouse to store over 5,000 units . __eou__ An option we can offer is two separate shipments.We will house the inventory until you are ready for us to ship it to you . __eou__
OK , so are you ready to learn how to bake a cake ? __eou__ Almost , let me just put my apron on . __eou__ OK , so the first thing we are going to do is pre-heat the oven , that way we have it at the desired temperature once we finish preparing everything . Set it to three hundred and seventy five degrees Fahrenheit . __eou__ Got it . __eou__ No we are gonna make the batter . Take some butter and sugar and mix it lightly until you have a nice consistency . Then add some vanilla extract and eggs and continue mixing . __eou__ Do I have to use a whisk or can I use the electric mixer ? __eou__ Go ahead and use the mixer , but put it on medium speed . I'm gonna sift the flour and baking powder separately and then we can mix it with milk and the rest of the ingredients . __eou__ OK , so now we need a baking pan right ? __eou__ Yeah , but grease and flour it first so the cake won't stick to it when it bakes . __eou__ Done . So how long do we bake it for ? __eou__ We can leave it in there for about twenty five minutes . Then we let it cool for ten minutes before we remove the cake from the pan . __eou__ Wow ! This was a lot easier than I thought ! __eou__
I remember you said that you like China because it has cheap beers . __eou__ Yes , unbelievably cheap . Carlsborg is less than $ 1 . __eou__ Why do you drink ? I mean , where does drinking get you ? __eou__ It's fashionable . __eou__ Come on , you don't even know that blinds following is a sign of immaturity . __eou__ Mary , it's not about the blind following . What matter is I enjoy in drinking . It's like when you get off of work . You're so tired . You need to get relaxed . You can't just turn on the TV and keep watch the programs until you fall asleep . You need to make your after work time more fun . __eou__ How ? By drinking ? __eou__ Drinking is just part of it . I mean , you have a bunch of friends coming by and having fun . You drink and talk . And the more you drink , the more you talk . It makes me so relaxed . __eou__ When did you begin to drink ? __eou__ It's a long time ago . When I first went to a bar to pick up girls there , I saw the most beautiful girl sitting and sipping a coke . Then I went up to her and said ' can I buy you a drink ? ' __eou__ And then ? __eou__ Then I talked to her and got her number . You know what ? When you don't know what to say ? Just drink . __eou__ So you get drunk every day ? __eou__
Excuse me , what material is it ? __eou__ Rhaki.Do you want some ? __eou__ No , where are the cotton cloths ? __eou__ I will show you . __eou__ What is the shrink rate after washing ? __eou__ Less than 5 % . It's quite durable . __eou__
I want to buy some cloth to make a curtain . Which one is better ? __eou__ What about the twill ? It washes well and won't lose shape . __eou__ What about the cotton one ? __eou__ Well , it's cheap and actually the color fades easily when washed . __eou__
Hello . __eou__ Hi , my sweetheart . It ’ s Dad . __eou__ Hi , Dad . Where are you ? __eou__ I ’ m at work right now . You can reach me at 905 675 9870 . Please call this number if you need me . __eou__ Thank you , Dad . __eou__ I love you . __eou__ I love you , too , Dad . __eou__
What are you doing to your house ? __eou__ We're redecorating our living room . __eou__ What are you going to do to it ? __eou__ First , we're going to change the curtains , then we're going to paint the walls . __eou__ What colour are you going to paint them ? __eou__ Pale yellow . __eou__ What else are you going to do ? __eou__ We're going to put in some new furniture . __eou__
What do you think of your teacher ? __eou__ He's very strict with us . __eou__ And I hear he gives very good lectures . __eou__ Indeed . He's strict with himself , too . We can see every lecture of his is well-prepared . __eou__
Whew ! I had to wait for almost an hour to get to the front of the line . __eou__ You have much patience . __eou__ Wow ! Your calligraphy is very beautiful . It was worth the wait ! __eou__ Thank you . Today I'm writing a kind of poem called a Chinese couplet . __eou__ What does it say ? __eou__ This is an especially famous one . It says " May the passing days bring you health and longevity . May this season of renewal find you basked in riches . " __eou__ That's very nice . Is it for sale ? __eou__ No . I never sell my artwork . __eou__ Really ? Then what do you do with it ? __eou__ I give it away . Here , this one is for you . __eou__ Wow ! Really ? Are you sure ? Now I'll have a lucky year ! __eou__ Remember , real luck must be created ( by ) yourself , and then it cannot be given or taken away ... __eou__
Lester , you are really fantastic at automobile repair . __eou__ Thanks , June . But I think I need to be certified as a mechanic before I ’ m allowed to repair cars for a living . __eou__ That ’ s not a big problem . There are many small schools for adults like you who can study to be certified . __eou__ I guess I never thought of that before . __eou__ And you can easily get a student loan from a vocational school , or from the government . __eou__ Wow , you ’ Ve inspired me to do something ! __eou__
What a lovely day . The sun is shinning and the sky is so blue . It's a perfect day to go to the beach and get a beautiful tan . __eou__ Great idea . Unlike you , I just want to enjoy watching the sea and playing with the sand . I do not want to get a tan because I look good in pale skin . __eou__ Come on . Getting a tan symbolizes health and wealth in western countries . __eou__ While the pale color symbolizes beauty and elegance in most Asia countries . __eou__ That is a really interesting fact . __eou__ I will bring a big hat and apply a lot of sunscreen before setting off the beach . __eou__ Just do whatever you feel like doing . __eou__ ( At the beach ) My bag is so heavy . Let's put the stuff under the tree . __eou__ Good idea . It is always cooler in a shade . __eou__ I can't wait to play in the water . My feet are burning when I stand on the sand . __eou__
Just make yourself at home . __eou__ Thank you . You are cooking up a storm . __eou__ Wouldn't you like some more chicken ? __eou__ No , thank you . I'm afraid I can't take in anymore . __eou__
It's said that John's broken up . __eou__ Really ? But his wife has always waited on him hand and foot . __eou__ I hear that John's leading a double wife . __eou__ It's very bad of him to cheat on a lady like his wife . __eou__
Don't just stand outside . Come on in . __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ This is Alex . Remember ? This is Sean . __eou__ Nice to meet you guys . __eou__ Over there are Stacy and Rebecca . We're all on the school's tennis team . __eou__ Who's that guy who's handing out beer to everyone ? __eou__ That's my boyfriend Matt . Isn't he cute ? __eou__ He sure is ! __eou__ Come on . I'll introduce you two . __eou__
Uncle , have a heart , please lend your new car to me . Only once . __eou__ Where are you going ? __eou__ I have a big date tonight . __eou__ You have got a car , haven ’ t you ? __eou__ Oh , please . Only once lend your new car to me . __eou__
OK , Ann , you spent quite a bit of time in Australia recently so why don't you talk about that ? __eou__ I really liked living in Australia . I was an international student and I studied education at the university of Sydney . And living in Sydney was fantasticbecuase I could go to the beach anytime I wanted and there was a great nightlife in Sydney . There are lots of great clubs . And people were very , very friendly and easy-going and I met a lot of international people in living Sydney . __eou__ Mm-hm . How long were you there ? __eou__ I was there for almost a year . __eou__ Oh , OK . __eou__ And I travelled a little bit in Australia . I went up the east coast . Up to Frasier Island . Which is a world heritage site . And I saw dingo running along the beach and sharks in the water . We climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the ... , which is a but north . And the further north you go in Australia , the hotter it gets . So we were able to go swimming in the ocean and I went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky cause I didn't have a diving license , so I went on an introductory dive and I saw a giant clam that had a really purple spongy inside that I was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly . __eou__ So , did you , did you lose your finger ? __eou__ Almost . __eou__ Almost . Ah , you're lucky . Um , it's funny , you go in the water and you worry about sharks , but not clams . __eou__ Exactly . __eou__ Will you be going back to Australia soon ? __eou__ I'd like to go and live there for at least another year . Probably I'll go back to Sydney or maybe I'll go down to Melbourne because it's a really interesting cultural city . They have lot of museums and parks . __eou__
Hello Michael . __eou__ Hello Todd . __eou__ We're going to talk about Australia . Or your going to talk about Australia . So first of all how any people live in Australia ? __eou__ Australia ? Oh , there's about twenty million people in Australia right now . A little bit under , but close to twenty . __eou__ OK . What are the biggest cities ? __eou__ The biggest city ? The biggest city is Sydney , then it's followed by Melbourne and then Brisbane and then I think it's Perth . But most of the big cities are on the East Coast of Australia . And Perth is on the west coast , but sort of of out there by itself . __eou__ OK . Um , if you had to live in one place where would you live ? __eou__ I like Brisbane . I had my teenage years in Brisbane , growing up in Brisbane , um or maybe Sidney because it is a big city , but Brisbane has got the gold coast and the sunshine . __eou__ Oh , nice . Actually , what is the capital city of Australia ? __eou__ Ah , Canberra is the capital city . But is not the biggest city . Sydney is the biggest city . Canberra was made sort of by the politicians so Sydney wouldn't get to crowded . It's a separate territory . __eou__
Is that you , Dave ? Oh , my gosh ! The backstabber who left us to work for the evil WebTracker ! __eou__ Yeah , yeah , yeah . Hi , Mary . How are you ? __eou__ I'm filthy rich ! Haven't you heard about the MicroPower deal ? __eou__ Yeah , I guess I did . They're going to buy invoking ? __eou__ That's right . For seventy-five million . So how are you ? __eou__ I'm getting by OK . I heard MicroPower was going to make Zina president of their new invoking Internet division . __eou__
Did you remember to bring back that software I lent to you ? __eou__ Oh , I ’ m sorry . It completely slipped my mind . __eou__ That ’ s ok . If you could just bring it in tomorrow , I would appreciate it . __eou__ Definitely , I ’ m really sorry . __eou__
I ’ m not a Christian . I just want to know why Americans believe that sort of thing . __eou__ Believe what ? __eou__ You know ... like , say God is the creator of the universe , the Bible , and Jesus Christ ... __eou__ You don ’ t believe that ? Everyone interprets the Bible in a different way . To some people , the Gospel 5 is a source of much comfort . __eou__ What do you believe , John ? Are you Christian ? __eou__ To tell you the truth , I don ’ t know if I ’ m a Christian or not . Christians don ’ t often share the same belief . But I believe that we all possess , by the grace of God , the potential to create fantastic changes on this earth . __eou__ Do you believe that one religion is better than another ? __eou__ No , all religions are essentially based on the same ideals , so no one is really better . __eou__ Do you go to church regularly ? __eou__ When I ’ m home in the States , I go , but not in China . __eou__
Anyone home ? Jen ! __eou__ I'm in the kitchen ... let yourself in ! __eou__ Wow ! You're really working up a storm ! __eou__ I know . I've even worked up a sweat . __eou__ You look like a cooking show host--only messier . __eou__
Did you watch the volleyball match last night ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Who won ? __eou__ China . __eou__ What is the score ? __eou__ China beat Brazil three to zero . __eou__ Wonderful . __eou__
Hi , Ellen . That outfit looks terrific ! __eou__ Thanks , Jim . I didn ’ t think guys paid attention to stuff like that . __eou__ No , we just don ’ t usually admit it ! __eou__ Well , thanks for the compliment anyway ! __eou__
Ann , let's go , or we will be late . __eou__ What time is it ? __eou__ It is already 10:25 . __eou__ Well , we still have about 15 minutes . __eou__ What time did you say the train is leaving ? __eou__ 12:05 . And it takes only 20 minutes to get to the station by bus . __eou__ Yes , but what will happen if the bus is late ? __eou__ Relax , those buses run every 10 minutes , so we have plenty of time . __eou__ ( still on the bus . ) What time is it ? __eou__ It is a quarter to twelve . __eou__ Oh dear , we will miss our train . __eou__
Ouch , it ’ s unbearable . __eou__ Please keep calm . I know the pain isn ’ t what flesh and blood can stand . But be brave . __eou__ All right , doctor . But it really hurts . __eou__
Mrs . Phoebe , let's talk about the delivery arrangement for our goods . __eou__ Sure . What's your date of delivery ? __eou__ I informed my company and was told that the first five thousand by the end of this month . __eou__ What about the balance of the order ? Can they also arrive at our company quickly ? __eou__ We can deliver the balance at the price already quoted in 10 days . __eou__ Can you deliver them earlier ? __eou__ I am afraid we can not do that . Would you be willing to sign an annual contract on the basis we discussed ? __eou__ Possibly , subject to quality and delivery guarantees . __eou__ Of course . Well , in that case we could offer a 5 % discount for a confirmed monthly order for the next 12 months . __eou__ I was looking forward to something a bit more substantial . As you know , we have long-time cooperation . __eou__ I'm afraid that's as far as we could go . We'd already be stretching ourselves to the limit . __eou__ Well , let's shake on that and draw up the details of the contract . __eou__
What would my new duties be ? __eou__ Your main responsibility is trouble-shooting between top management and the general employees . __eou__ Will I have the chance to take business trip abroad once in a while ? __eou__ Yes , you definitely will . __eou__
Mom , where are you going ? __eou__ I am going to buy some food to cook for supper . __eou__ Good . I wanna come with you . __eou__ How strange ! Our little emperor now asks to help out with shopping . __eou__ We learnt about vegetables and meat at school . But I never see the real thing . __eou__ Wow , that's something new . Let's go ! What's this , honey ? __eou__ Er , is it cabbage ? __eou__ Cabbage ? Is that what they teach at school now ? OK , honey , it's spinage . __eou__ Yeah , I know , this is Popeye's favorite food . __eou__ There we go . __eou__ Mom , come here . I know this , it is carrot , am I right ? __eou__ Bingo ! It's dark outside , Let's hurry up . __eou__
Hey honey ! Where were you ? __eou__ I decided to take Kenny to the park and get some fresh air . __eou__ How was it ? Were there a lot of kids ? __eou__ It wasn't too crowded , but we had a great time ! We got on the see-saw together , then went on a couple of different slides and then I tried to go with him in the jungle gym , but I didn't fit . __eou__ Sounds like fun ! When we go he always just likes to play in the sandbox . __eou__ Yeah , but today he was really hyper . He even got on the monkey bars and then he went on to go on the swings for a half hour . I'm exhausted ! __eou__ You should go to the park more often since you don't go to the gym anymore ! __eou__
I think it is easier to buy a car than to maintain it . What ’ s worse , I just don ’ t trust those vehicle maintenance shops . Sometimes , they overcharge or don ’ t build those parts I have been paying for . Last week , they even tried to persuade me to buy new parts which really need not to be changed . You know , my car is just half a year old and also good brand . I was just wondering about all these . __eou__ There are such shops living on selling parts . I don ’ t like their service either . All they want is your money . But in the long run , they will be losing costumers . Anyway , car service business is new in China . We all have to control what they are doing . Otherwise , they will not improve . __eou__ Is it possible to make a compliant call to some organization what it ’ s someone gets rip-off . __eou__ Yes , there is . Those organizations exist . You always can call a lawyer if you need legal help . __eou__
There ’ s a big sale on clothes and sporting goods at Riverside Mall . __eou__ Sporting goods ? Is that bike Tim wanted on sale ? __eou__ Yeah , it ’ s 30 percent off the regular price . __eou__ Well , maybe we could get it now and hide it until his birthday . __eou__ Yeah , it ’ s a couple weeks away , and we don ’ t have anything yet . __eou__ Don ’ t buy him underwear again . He hates that . __eou__ I know , I know , but if I didn ’ t buy it for him , he ’ d never buy it . __eou__ See anything else we need there ? __eou__ Well , all shoes are 20 percent off . __eou__ Shoes ? You already have a closet full of shoes . __eou__ I know , but another pair can ’ t hurt . __eou__ Oh , all right . I need some new shirts , too . Let ’ s go after breakfast . __eou__
I just had a terrible week . __eou__ What a shame ! __eou__ I fell down and hurt my arm . __eou__ That's too bad . __eou__ Then my son drove into a tree . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . __eou__ The dog bit the delivery boy . __eou__ What a pity ! __eou__ And a storm blew our roof away . __eou__ Ho , no ! __eou__
I've brought a little dog for Alice , girls usually like looking after pets . __eou__ Thank you , but Alice is only a visitor here . I don't know if she'll keep it . __eou__ To tell you the truth , the dog isn't my real reason for coming . I want to ask Alice if she'd like to be my girlfriend . __eou__ Really ? __eou__
Hah ! For three hours while you threw up . And Femi dumped me for that . I really loved her . __eou__ I'm so sorry , Taylor . Go talk to her . I'm sure she'd be happy to see you . __eou__ She probably wouldn't even recognize me . She's probably married . __eou__ Yi-jun said Femi was talking about you . So get out there , Tiger ! __eou__ Was she really ? So you're telling me there's a chance ? __eou__ Can't hurt to try . Carpe diem . Who can say if we'll be here tomorrow or not ? __eou__
Anita , I ’ Ve been here only three days and you ’ re leaving already . __eou__ Just for a few weeks . I need this vacation . You ’ ll be all right . You know the project we ’ re working on , and you ’ re a good scientist . Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll be back as soon as I spend or gamble all my money . __eou__ Gambling ? Where ? __eou__ Las Vegas . I find gambling relaxing . I don ’ t take it seriously , the way some people do . Besides , I love the shows and the all-night atmosphere of the town . The casinos never close , you know . __eou__ If you gamble all night , you ’ ll run out of money in a few days . __eou__
Your muscles are a spectacle ! __eou__ Thank you.That ' s the result of exercise.By the way , do you work out ? __eou__ No , but I am starting working out from now on . __eou__ Fine . __eou__
Why have you changed your job so frequently ? __eou__ My first job was in a well-established company where the division of labour was very clear . I do not have more chances to enrich my experience . Then I got an opportunity to really broaden my experience with a new company that was starting up , but unfortunately , they closed their service in three months ' time . I have worked in my present company for a considerable length of time and enjoy the job I am doing now , but I think I have accumulated enough experience to take up more challenging post in a much larger and diversified company where I could make solid contribution . __eou__
Hi , Monica , I am afraid I can ’ t make it to the office to punch out . __eou__ Where are you ? __eou__ I am still in XYZ Company , this meeting took longer than I expected . Say to it that the office manager knows I won ’ t be in to punch my card . __eou__ Ok . __eou__
I ’ d like to ask whether it is correct to partake in the firm ’ s insurance plan ? __eou__ If you want my advice , you won ’ t invite yourself any risk . __eou__ But people keep talking about the benefits from the plan . __eou__
May I help you ? __eou__ Give me a six-piece chicken nuggets , a large fry and a large Coke . __eou__ You need to wait a few minutes for the fries . They are still in the flyer . __eou__ That's fine . __eou__ Your total comes to $ 7 . __eou__ Here's a twenty note . __eou__ Thank you . Your cash back is $ 13 . Pull into a parking space . And we'll bring out your fries in two minutes . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
Can I help you ? __eou__ I'm looking for a Sharp DVD Player . __eou__ Sure . Any particular model ? __eou__ Yes . The DS102 series . __eou__ Oh , I'm afraid we've sold out of those . They were really popular . __eou__ Will you be getting more in . __eou__ Yes . But not for about 2 weeks . __eou__
OK , Mr . Wu . You may come in . I'm Anne Smith and on my right , my colleague , Anna Duncan , and on my left , Angela Lamb . Do please sit down . __eou__ Thank you . Good afternoon Mrs . Smith , Miss Duncan , Miss Lamb . __eou__ Your English is fluent . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ How do you think of the weather today ? __eou__ I don't like the weather like this . Cold and rainy . Hope it become sunny as soon as possible . __eou__
What sport do you like the most ? __eou__ I like baseball the best . __eou__ Me too . Did you play when you were a kid ? __eou__ Yeah . I played until I graduated from high school . __eou__ What position did you play ? __eou__ I think I tried every position , but the last few years , I played third base . __eou__ I hate third base . It's scary when the ball is coming at you so fast . __eou__ It was scary at first , but after awhile , I got used to it . If you have fast reflexes , then it's not really a problem . What position did you play ? __eou__ I played outfield . I hated the infield because I never figured out all the bounces . __eou__ I wish I could play again , but there isn't much opportunities around here . __eou__ I'm on a softball league . It's not fast pitch , but it's still fun . You wanna join our group ? __eou__ When do you guys play ? __eou__ We play either Tuesdays or Thursdays . __eou__ Sounds pretty fun . I'll come out and join you next time . __eou__
Bill , Happy Halloween ! __eou__ Happy Halloween ! What creature are you going to dress up as ? __eou__ I will dress up as a vampire with big fangs . __eou__ May I have a look at your costume ? __eou__ Sure . Wait a moment . ( Several minutes later ) Here you are . __eou__ I like your black clothes and your fangs are cool . __eou__ I will bite many beautiful girls on the neck tonight . Maybe I will suck their blood . __eou__ Haha . Wish you good luck . __eou__
Two people were robbed last night near the park . __eou__ Again ? The area around the park is too dark at night . There should be more lights there . __eou__ I am afraid of the dark . I don ’ t feel safe in the dark . I feel someone is hiding in the dark to attack me . __eou__ Your feelings might be right . You should never walk alone there at night . It is too dangerous . __eou__ I Know . And you should be more careful , too . __eou__
Mary and Tom are breaking up . __eou__ It's unbelievable ! They are only married for one month . Then who is at fault ? __eou__ Mary said she couldn't put up with Tom , for he fell in love with another woman . __eou__ Do you think they'll become reconciled ? __eou__ No , I don't think so . She said she would rather be single than cope with an unhappy marriage . __eou__ What a shame ! Their marriage is really a mistake . __eou__
At their last meeting , the stockholders voted unanimously to block the merger of our company with Blycore . All the executive committee was in favor of the merger ... I don't understand how the stockholders could have so much power to throw a wrench in the plans ... __eou__ If they all unite on a certain issue , it's the stockholders who have the final say . You'd think it might be our CEO or the workers , but in fact , the stockholders control the money so they have the most power . __eou__ Is it really that simple ? It doesn't seem very efficient to run things that way ... __eou__ It might not be the most efficient , but if you think about it , it makes pretty good sense . The stockholders are our investors . They own the capital in our company , so they should have say about what is done with the company . __eou__ I guess I'd buy that ... __eou__
I'm more worried about snipers . __eou__ Snipers ? __eou__ Sniping is when someone makes a bid at the very last minute to steal something for a bargain price . __eou__ So you're afraid someone is going to snipe your Buddha ? __eou__ I heard about a software program called turbid . It automatically submits a bid with just a few seconds to go in an auction . __eou__ Count me out . I can do without shills and snipers and turbo-bidders . __eou__
I bought it . I got a watch , too . The company that sells this car has a car club . __eou__ Where you can buy lots of paraphernalia ? __eou__ Yeah , and meet other drivers of the same car ! __eou__ Cool ! __eou__ I know girls love this kind of car . Look , it's got a sunroof ! Imagine ... a cool , starry night ... __eou__ So , you're going to use Sarah's car to go cruising for chicks ? __eou__ No . I borrowed it to go shopping . __eou__
Check out these wheels ! __eou__ You bought a compact car ? __eou__ No , I borrowed it . __eou__ Let me guess , from Sarah . It looks like something she would drive . __eou__ You guessed right . Besides , the color violet is a little girly for me . __eou__ I love it . It's so festive ! And where did you get that cup ? It's got the same logo . __eou__
How would you describe your relationship with our boss ? __eou__ We have a fairly good working relationship , but there was also a rough spot . __eou__ What do you think his strengths are ? __eou__ Well , he has an amazing ability to analyze information and he is very good at making the right decision in tough situations . __eou__
Well , what did you think about the last candidate ? Do you think we should hire her ? __eou__ She had a very impressive resume , but she seemed to lack the confidence that I think a good manager needs . __eou__ What made you think that she wasn't very confident ? __eou__ Did you notice the way that she avoided making eye contact with us while she talked ? __eou__ She was a bit nervous , I guess . What else ? __eou__ When she first walked into the room to greet us , she didn't shake our hands or introduce herself at all . I thought that was a bit unprofessional . __eou__ you're right . If she walked into meetings with our clients like that , it would make our company look bad , wouldn't it ? __eou__ It sure would . Did you also notice the way she slouched in her chair during most of the interview ? She had horrible posture ! __eou__ I agree . I guess I was paying more attention to her answers than her body language . __eou__ On top fo all of that , she didn't seem to have any sense about people's personal space . she didn't keep enough distance between us when during the meeting . __eou__ That's true . I guess we'll have to keep looking for a manager then . __eou__ Don't worry , we'll find someone eventually ! __eou__
We'd better cover the porcelain ware against All Risks . __eou__ All right . Our insurance coverage is 110 % of the invoice value , up to the port of destination only . __eou__ I'd like to have the insurance of the goods covered up to 130 % of the invoice amount . __eou__ Ok , this premium for the difference between 130 % and 110 % of the invoice value should be borne by the buyer . __eou__ That's understood . __eou__
How do you like the food here ? __eou__ I don't like it very much.But every-body likes their own food best . __eou__ There are many things I miss .

All the big cities have specialty shops , which sell all sorts of ethnic foods . __eou__ Perhaps . i just haven't had time to find them yet . __eou__
Why are you up so early , Mary ? __eou__ I'm still suffering from a little jetlag . __eou__ What are you watching ? __eou__ Saturday morning cartoons . __eou__ At least five channels have morning cartoons on Saturdays . __eou__ I think watching them is a great way to learn English . __eou__ I agree . And some cartoons are entertaining even for adults . __eou__ Yeah . Is Cindy up ? __eou__ Are you kidding ? It's too early for her . __eou__
Hello ! __eou__ Hello , Debbie . This is Donald . __eou__ Oh , hi , Donald . __eou__ What happened yesterday ? You forgot our date , didn ’ t you ? __eou__ Well , it rained hard all day and I had a bad cold , so I decided to stay home . __eou__ You did ? But I tried to call you at least twenty times and nobody answered . __eou__ Oh , the telephone lines were damaged by the storm . They repaired them yesterday . __eou__ What did David do yesterday ?

I listened to records and studied , what did you do yesterday , Donald ? __eou__ I just told you , Debbie . I tried to call you twenty times ! __eou__
Don ’ t you have air-conditioning in your apartment ? It ’ s sweltering here ! __eou__ Well , there is air-conditioning . Did you see that window air conditioner there ? The problem is that the window unit isn ’ t powerful enough . __eou__ I guess not , huh . __eou__ Well , I ’ m going to move out anyway . The new apartment has central air-conditioning . __eou__ You should have moved out long , long ago . __eou__ Well , I had to wait until the lease expired . So ... __eou__ So how can you stand the heat ? __eou__ Well , I open the windows and ... and I ’ Ve got an electric fan ere . It helps a little . __eou__
Hello , Vicki . __eou__ Hi , David . What a beautiful necklace ! Dude , I ’ Ve never seen anything like it . __eou__ Well , you can have it for eleven hundred — as a friend . __eou__ I think seven hundred is enough . __eou__ What ? Seven hundred ? __eou__ Well , eight hundred , then ? __eou__ No , one thousand at least . __eou__ Eight hundred and fifty . Come on . I have 4 kids , 3 dogs , and 2 husbands to feed ! __eou__ You ’ re a thief , Vicki . But I guess , eight hundred and fifty is all right . __eou__ Here you are , sucker ! __eou__ Victory for me , I bought it for 30 bucks just yesterday ! __eou__
What's wrong , Dave ? You look down today . __eou__ I didn't pass the English exam . How to learn English well ? Can you give me some suggestions ? __eou__ Well , English is a " paper tiger " . Its natural enemy is adequate practice . __eou__ I have done a lot of reading comprehension exercises , and I also spend much time in memorizing English words . __eou__ I suggest you read English texts aloud every day , and try to speak more . That will be beneficial to cultivate your sense of the language . __eou__ Really ? I'll have a try . Maybe I will get high marks next time . __eou__
Hi Cody , how did practicing go this week ? __eou__ Well I had several tests and an oral presentation this week so I didn ’ t get a chance to memorize the second page , but I think I mastered the tricky section . __eou__ Great ! Warm up with some scales and arpeggios first . Good , good . This week , work on keeping the rhythm steady when you play the last part with the sixteenth note . Now let ’ s take a look at this __eou__ Charles ? Before I start I was wondering if it was ok if I put a small crescendo in here and then decrescendo back to pianissimo again over here ? __eou__ It might work . I ’ ll have to hear it.Show me what you ’ Ve done . __eou__ It was horrible ! I played play it much better at home ! __eou__ It ’ s just nerves . Just play the right hand for now . One two three four five six , ta ti tri-ple-ti . Good , good . Don ’ t forget the accidentals ! The key signature says that note should be a G-sharp b __eou__ Is that better ? __eou__ Yes , much better . Watch where you lift your foot off the pedal . What was that ? __eou__ Sorry ! The stretch for that octave is always hard to make . __eou__ That's ok , keep going , you ’ re moving ahead by leaps and bounds . Watch your dynamics ! Keep your elbows lifted . Remember to stroke the keys , don ’ t pound . That ’ s better ! Remember that as a pianist or any __eou__
How do you shoot pool ? __eou__ You have 16 balls on the table , 7 solid colored , 7 striped colored , a black 8 ball , and the white ball . __eou__ And ? __eou__ You hit the white ball with your cue . The white ball hits the colored balls . And you want to get the colored balls into the pockets . __eou__ How do you know whether you should hit the solid or the striped one ? __eou__ At the beginning , it does not matter , but once someone gets one ball in , it is set . __eou__ Can I get the black ball in ? __eou__ The black ball has to be the final ball in the pockets . __eou__ Let's go and try now ! __eou__
Like a cat on hot bricks , as you might say . I don ’ t believe you are listening at all . __eou__ Sorry , I just worried about him . You know , he should be here an hour ago . __eou__ Don ’ t worry him , he has been grown up and I think he can take himself very well . __eou__ But he still does not come back . __eou__ Maybe he is on the way home now . __eou__
Oh , my ! It's really hot . I've never seen such scorching weather in my life . __eou__ Tell me about it ! It's like the whole world is broiling . __eou__ Oh , look at the thermometer ! The temperature has hit 98 . __eou__ I hope it's not gonna break into three digits __eou__ But it's already awfully close . __eou__ Well , I just hope it'll level off . __eou__ I guess you can ’ t do anything until after dark then . __eou__ I guess so . What else can we do ? You can ’ t stay in the heat for long . __eou__
Bobby ! Come here , look what I got you ! __eou__ What is that ? __eou__ A chess board ! Daddy is going to teach you how to play ! __eou__ Cool ! __eou__ Ok , each player gets 16 pieces . You can be the white ones and I ’ ll play with the black pieces . Now in the front , you set up the pawns . Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . When you are about to capture another piece , it can move one space diagonally . __eou__ What about all these other pieces ? __eou__ See this one that looks like a tower ? It ’ s called the rook . The one with the tall hat is called the bishop . See this little horsey ? This is called the knight , it ’ s a very important piece so it ’ s best to not let your opponent capture it . __eou__ And these two ? They are husband and wife ? __eou__ That ’ s right ! That ’ s the queen and that ’ s the king . If the other player captures your king , he will say Check Mate and the game is over ! Doesn ’ t this sound fun ? __eou__ Nah ! This is boring ! I ’ m gonna go play Killer Zombies on my PlayStation ! __eou__

We should go to buy some fruit first . __eou__ It is heavy and not convenient to take them to the top . __eou__ How about taking a cantaloupe ? It is light and sweet . Children love it . __eou__ Good idea . We can buy some candy and nuts for children . __eou__ Yes . Look , cashew , peanuts , assorted biscuits , chocolate , canned goods , anything else ? __eou__ That's enough for the kids . Get some drinks . __eou__ Definitely beer . Two bottles . __eou__ Right .

Hello , Daisy , how are you doing ? __eou__ Fine , thank you . I haven ’ t seen you for quite some time . What have you been up to recently ? __eou__ I have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home , so you wouldn't have seen me . Recently , I've been obsessed with horror films . __eou__ Oh , how can you be infatuated with horror films ? They're so scary . __eou__ Yeah , you are right I used to not watch horror films , but after seeing Silence of the Lamb with Mike last month , I fell in love with them . __eou__ It's amazing . But if I were you , I wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one . __eou__ But it's really exciting . __eou__ Maybe , but I would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . I wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one . __eou__ Basically . you'll watch any type of movie except horror . __eou__ Yep . __eou__ I think you should have a try someday . Maybe you'll change your mind . __eou__ Maybe . After all , I am grown up now . __eou__
Television is undoubtedly a great invention , but one of the main criticisms of it is that people just aren't selective enough . Lesley , got a television . how do you pick out the sorts ofprogrammes you want to watch ? __eou__ I try and look at the programmes that are on to decide which particular ones interest me , rather than you turning it on a seven o'clock and you leaving it on until half-past eleven when the programmes finish . __eou__ Do you think of television though as a great time-waster ? __eou__ Un ... I think it can be a time-waster and it depends on how particular people are about what they want to see ... Mm , it can just be a sort total amusement for someone and totally consuming without reallyconsidering what it is they're watching . __eou__ Aha , but how do you prevent it coming into your life and taking oversour evenings and at the same time perhaps get . . . get out of thetelevision some of the sort of best things ... best programmes that ... that undoubtedly are on television ? __eou__ Well , I suppose one of the problems is ... will depend on what a person's life style is , and that if he has other outside interests which are equally important to him as television , he will then , you know , hmm . be more careful about which programme she wants to watch because he has time which he wants to use for other things . __eou__ Do you think though that ... that in . . . in a sense television skilled people's own er ... sort of , creativity or their ability entertain themselves because if they're bored all they do is justturn on the television ? __eou__ Yes , I think that is a danger , and I think that . . in fact is what mishappening to a lot of people who use it as their ... their main ... um field of amusement and ... because they don't have other outside interests and even when people come round they'll leave the television and not be , you know , particularly interested in talking to them , you Know the television will be the main thing in the room . __eou__
Did you see the picture of the guy on the front page of the newspaper this morning ? __eou__ No . I haven't had a chance to read the paper yet . __eou__ you've got to see it . It's an unbelievable picture ! __eou__ What's so interesting about it ? __eou__ Well , this guy fell asleep on the sofa and when he woke up , half his face had been bitten off ! __eou__ What ? How did that happen ? __eou__ They think his dog was trying to wake him up and couldn't , so ended up biting him in his face . __eou__ Wow . What does his look like now ? __eou__ It looks pretty frightening . He doesn't have any lips , so all you can see are his gums and teeth . Most of his nose and chin are missing too . __eou__ What did he look like before his dog bit his face off ? __eou__ He was actually quite handsome . What a shame . __eou__ What's he going to do now ? __eou__ It said that he's hoping to get a face transplant , but until then , he's looking forward to Halloween so he isn't the only one wearing a mask . __eou__
I will be accompanying you on your tour today to visit our company . This is the assembly line . These drawings on the wall are process sheets . They describe clearly how each process goes on to the next step . __eou__ How many workers are there on the lines ? __eou__ About 200 . They can assemble at least 3,000 computers every day . __eou__ Oh , it's highly efficient . __eou__ Yes , since I came to this company , I was told that high efficiency is essential for the further development . __eou__ How do you control the quality of the products ? __eou__ Well , all products have to go through five checks in the whole process . We believe that the quality is the soul of an enterprise . There fore , we always put quality as the first consideration . __eou__ Yes , quality is even more than the quantity . __eou__ Mr . Chandler , this way please . I will show you a five-minute multivision about the history of our company . __eou__

I'm confident we won't have any major problems . __eou__
Hi , Mary , you have been a secretary for several years in this company . Could you tell me what a secretary should do for a meeting or a conference ? __eou__ Well , an important part of the duties of a secretary , I think , is to do well the preparation work for the meeting . __eou__ What should a secretary do to prepare for a meeting ? Can you tell me a bit more about it ? __eou__ First of all , the agenda should be prepared before the meeting . Then you should ensure that those entitled to be present are properly informed . __eou__ I see , and how about the documents and the information ? __eou__ All the necessary documents and the information relevant to the meeting should be available , preferably printed and distributed before the meeting . __eou__ And what should a secretary do during the meeting ? __eou__ Of course , she should take minutes . __eou__ And after the meeting ? __eou__ After the meeting she should type the minutes up , and then keep proper records of the business transacted and the resolutions passed and also implement many of the decision reached at the meeting . __eou__ It's seriously good . __eou__
Lucy , I ’ d like to fix the light in the corridor , it keeps flashing , which drives me crazy . Would you like to help me with the ladder ? __eou__ Monica , wait a moment . I think we ’ d better call the repair man to do it . __eou__ I think I can handle it by myself . __eou__ I ’ d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company . __eou__ I see . If I got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , I wouldn ’ t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility . __eou__ Other company rules also need your attention . __eou__ Like this one ? Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder.Yeah , thank you for telling me . __eou__ Don ’ t mention it . __eou__
Which service offered by your bank do you use most ? __eou__ I use several services . Of course , I deposit and withdraw money quite often . I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account . I use my bank to exchange money from one currency to another . I often travel abroad , you see . __eou__ Do you ever ask you bank for traveller ’ s cheques ? They are much safer than carrying lots of cash around . __eou__ I sometimes use traveller ’ s cheques , but sometimes I travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash . __eou__ Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills ? I use direct debit . __eou__ Yes , I do . It save me a lot of time . I also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines . __eou__ That ’ s good idea . You don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that . I suppose you have a mortgage too . __eou__ Yes . My bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage . There ’ s a lot of competition between banks nowadays . Each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others . __eou__ I have a deposit account with my bank . There are some restrictions on withdrawing money , but the interest rate is much higher . __eou__ I don ’ t have one . I prefer to buy shares . My bank also provides a share trading service . It ’ s cheap and easy to use . __eou__ That ’ s great . But I prefer to put my money somewhere where the returns are more certain . __eou__
Have you applied for you visa to go to study in the united states yet ? __eou__ Yes , I have . I handed in my application form two weeks ago and I ’ m going for an interview next week . __eou__ Good luck ! I ’ Ve heard it ’ s very difficult to get a visa to go to the united states . __eou__ The application form are quite complicated . It took me a few hours to fill it out . The hardest thing was getting all the necessary documents . That took almost two weeks . __eou__ What kind of documents did you need to present ? __eou__ I had to show document relating to my financial status and of course my education , because I want a student visa . __eou__ Why do you think so many people have their applications rejected ? __eou__ I think that they don ’ t complete the forms correctly or they don ’ t include all the required documents . The embassy is very strict about it . You have to be quite careful . __eou__ Why are they stricter with Chinese people than with other nationalities ? __eou__ That ’ s simple . Many people break the rules regarding their visa conditions . __eou__
I cooked , so ... __eou__ Okay ! I'll do the dishes . __eou__
Help ! I'm about to drop these books . __eou__ I've got them . __eou__ Thanks ! __eou__

Julia , I apologize to you for what I have done . Please forgive me . __eou__ I've already forgiven you . Actually , I also owe you an apology . I was so rude to you that day . __eou__ It does ’ t matter . I know that people are easy to get mad when they're tired . __eou__ Thanks for your understanding . __eou__ You're welcome . Happy couples need mutual understanding . __eou__

And then I often go Rollerblading . __eou__ Wow ! How often do you exercise like that ? __eou__ About five times a week . What about you ? __eou__ Oh , I hardly ever exercise . I usually just watch TV in my free time . I guess I'm a real couch potato ! __eou__

If you're feeling so much better , you'll ace that English test , right ? __eou__ OK . I get it . I'm getting back into bed ... __eou__
Well , you know how important a clean house is to your grandma . __eou__ Yes , I hear about it every time she comes here . __eou__ She was the head janitor at St . Mary's Hospital for thirty years , after all . __eou__ I think she misses that job and wants to take it out on us . __eou__ You know , maybe she's just a neat freak . __eou__ I think she just likes to make us miserable . __eou__ You could be right . __eou__
Johnny , have you tidied up your room yet ? __eou__ Not yet , Mom . Why are you on such a cleanliness kick anyway ? __eou__ Do I have to remind you that your grandma is arriving tonight ? __eou__ Oh , my God , I forgot grandma's coming ! __eou__ Yes , so this place had better be clean .

And they're spending enough on the plane tickets to Texas ! __eou__ Speaking of plane tickets , don't forget to check on the reservations ! __eou__ OK . __eou__
But what if I don't win what I bid on ? __eou__ Then it wasn't meant to be . Some people have put up a hard fight for some items I bid on . But I was the sole bidder for this bag and got it dirt-cheap . __eou__ It seems that you can e-mail the seller and ask questions . __eou__ Sure . I've even e-mailed some people who had bought from the person who sold this bag . __eou__ And people are honest ? __eou__ They said he was an honest and professional businessman . But that's the exciting part . It's kind of like gambling ... __eou__
Hi , I'm back ! Hmm ... your hair is pretty damaged , and you've got split ends . __eou__ Really ? What can I do ? __eou__ Well , the trim should fix the split ends , but you might need a deep conditioning treatment . __eou__ Umm , OK . Whatever you think will help . __eou__ I'm also going to add some layers to frame your face . __eou__ Can you use the thinning shears on top , too ?

Wow . She can be really nasty , can't she ? __eou__ No . She was right . I was too nervous . I kept thinking , What if we blow it ? __eou__ Well , I guess Zina figured you couldn't blow it if you were in the hotel room . __eou__ She even stayed at a different hotel . She said I might be contagious . __eou__ Well , at least we have Stars.com . That'll be great publicity . __eou__
I've been standing here since half past seven . Where on earth have you been ? __eou__ I'm terribly sorry I'm late . I just couldn't help it . __eou__ It's really very easy saying you're sorry . __eou__ Look , just give me a chance . I can explain it . __eou__
What ? I don't get it ... __eou__ Many of the slower dances are danced to the lyrics of tragedies . He meant that you turned it into a comedy . __eou__ Well , I'm glad I made everyone happy . __eou__ He meant it in a good way . You added a little spice to the performance . __eou__ I'm glad you guys all have such a good sense of humor . Ha-ha ... __eou__ Of course ! That's why I always say , Eat , drink and be Greek ! __eou__

I am so sorry . __eou__ What did you think you were doing ? __eou__ I had to move it , so that I can get my bike through . __eou__ How dare you be so inconsiderate ? That's wrong . __eou__ I am awfully sorry . I didn't think you would mind so much . __eou__ Never do that again . __eou__ I promise . __eou__

Does your child still believe in Santa Claus ? __eou__ Yes . She believes everything about him . __eou__ How sweet . __eou__ Yes . If she doesn't believe it , Christmas won't be so exciting to her . __eou__ When are you going to tell her that Santa Claus doesn't exist ? __eou__ I'm not going to tell her . She will find out and understand when she grows older . __eou__
Hello , Jack ! Fancy meeting you here ! __eou__ Yes , it's really a surprise . How are you ? __eou__ Fine . How is Jim ? __eou__ Oh , he is all right . But busy as usual .

The police need our help finding a robber . __eou__ How do you know ? __eou__ The TV news is reporting a bank robbery . __eou__ Do they know what the robber looks like ? __eou__ Yes , he's 6 feet tall , 200 pounds , black hair , and about 30 years old . __eou__ What race is he ? __eou__ They didn't say . __eou__ The TV news doesn't tell us the race anymore . __eou__ Of course not . That would be racist . __eou__ But how can we identify someone if we don't know their race ? __eou__ Don't ask me . __eou__ Then they also shouldn't tell us if the robber is male or female , because that is sexist . __eou__
Have you been to Shanghai before ? __eou__ Yes I have . I ’ Ve been there three times in the past year . __eou__ That sounds great . Have you been to the top of the Pearl Tower ? __eou__ No I haven ’ t . I haven ’ t visited the Bund either . I ’ Ve always had too much work to do . __eou__ So you haven ’ t done much then , in Shanghai ? __eou__ Actually , I ’ Ve eaten soup dumplings in a lovely restaurant on Nanjing Lu . They were delicious ! __eou__

May , we are fools to hang out at noon . It's dying hot today . My skin is too weak to be exposed under the summer sun . __eou__ Do you have any sunscreen lotion ? __eou__ You know , honey , I used it all on the way over . __eou__ I think I'm getting a heart stroke . __eou__ The heat is driving crazy and I hate my new hat . __eou__ Why ? It's brand new , and it's perfect on you . __eou__ But I bought it to get rid of the heat . Now it does nothing but burning my head . __eou__ Beauty costs , honey . __eou__ Laugh all you want , whatever . We need to get out of the heat . __eou__ Walking under the sun is certainly not the way . __eou__ Give me a break . It's not funny . __eou__ Right . Sorry . Anyway , the radio said that it'll rain later today . __eou__ Hope so ! Good thing is that autumn is just around the corner . __eou__
You want to go with him ? __eou__ Yes ? __eou__ Then you must be off your head . He is a real bastard . __eou__
Do you like watching TV ? __eou__ Yes I do , usually . __eou__ What do you exactly mean by usually ? __eou__ I don't like spending time on commercials.There ' re too many commercials on TV . __eou__

I have something really cool to tell you about ! Do you know anything about online auctions ? __eou__ Not really . __eou__ They're awesome ! I was browsing through the eBay auction today , and I found the cutest fat little copper Buddha ! It's over a hundred years old . __eou__ Please don't tell me you bought it . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ If you did , you probably got ripped off . __eou__
I think I need a new notebook . __eou__ Why ? Is there some new , cool computer out on the market ? __eou__ You bet there is . Feast your eyes on this puppy ! __eou__ That's a notebook ? __eou__ Believe it ! __eou__ It looks more like a toy , or a cool briefcase ! __eou__

So what did you think about the movie ? __eou__ Well , I think this Star Wars episode is an excellent piece of work , but not as good as the previous ones . __eou__ Really ? I don't agree . This Star Wars episode was incredible ! __eou__ Why do you think so ? __eou__ Well , one of the most spectacular things about this one was the special effects . State of the art special effects are the main reason for the success of previous episodes , so audiences have high expectations for this one , and I don't think they will be disappointed . __eou__ You are right . The special effects were amazing . And I like the fact that they created so many fantastic settings and otherworldly costumes , weapons and creatures . __eou__ It's kind of cool that they are still using the same Star Wars theme song for this movie . __eou__ Yeah ! It reminds me of the previous Star Wars scenes . __eou__ I know exactly what you mean . Hearing that song gives me a nostalgic feeling . __eou__ I thought the overall plot of the movie was very interesting , but I don't think the character development was that strong . __eou__ Do you think that they had anything to do with the casting of the movie ? __eou__ No , the casting is great and the actors were excellent . They just didn ’ t have a lot of funny or meaningful dialogues . The writing was also a little weak . __eou__ Well , maybe . But I like the little kid who played Manakin Skywalker . I can't imagine anyone else playing that role . __eou__ I liked him too . He is so cute ! You know , even though I was slightly disappointed , I can't wait for the next episode . I wonder when they ’ re going to start making it and when it ’ s scheduled for release ? __eou__ I've no idea . But looking at the success of Star Wars episode , I've a strong feeling production for the next episode will be selling pretty soon . I hope It will be even better than this one . __eou__ I hope so , too . __eou__ Well , I think we should go now . It's getting pretty late . __eou__ Okay , let's go ! __eou__
Those are today ’ s top stories . Now let ’ s go to John for the weather . John , what does the forecast look like for our weekend travelers ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid we ’ re in for a rough weekend , Mary . There is a storm system moving through the East Coast . It will be drizzling all day today , and there ’ s a 60 percent chance of thunderstorms this eve __eou__ That ’ s pretty chilly for the summer ! Will it rain on Saturday ? __eou__ Unfortunately , yes . It will be clear early Saturday morning but there is a high chance of showers and thunderstorms later in the day . There is a severe thunderstorm warning for some parts of the Sout __eou__ That certainly sounds like a dreary Saturday . __eou__ It gets better on Sunday , though . The storm systems move east and the skies will clear up at night . It will still be rather cool , with highs in the low 50s . The West Coast will be experiencing some __eou__
You should have seen the T . V . show that was on last night , the topic it covered was really interesting , animal rights . __eou__ Do you really believe in that ? If they are going to focus on something , they should do it on civil rights . __eou__ Yes , but we can ’ t deny that animals are vulnerable , defenseless , and are completely at the mercy of human beings . __eou__ I understand your point , but we continue to have transgressions against human rights . If so much attention weren ’ t devoted to the topic of animals , we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala . __eou__ You can ’ t compare apples and oranges . I believe that both topics are important and that we can ’ t ignore them , the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance . I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching . __eou__ Well , you are right on that point . This is the reason that I don ’ t buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products . __eou__ As long as you don ’ t treat it better than your wife , it ’ s fine . __eou__
... And now , let ’ s go to Kenny Williams for today ’ s weather forecast . __eou__ Thank you Bill , and good morning Salt Lake City ! __eou__ What ’ s the weather looking like today , Kenny ? __eou__ Well , it ’ s a bit of a mixed bag in Utah today . we ’ Ve got heavy cloud cover here in Northern Utah , and we ’ re calling for scattered showers throughout the day , with a day-time high of forty-five degrees.Now , if we move down to the south of the state , we can see that a cold front is moving in.We can expect clear skies , but it will be quite cold , with temperatures hovering around the thirty degree mark . __eou__ It ’ s a chilly day folks , so don ’ t forget your coats ! What about tomorrow Kenny ? Do you have good news for us ? __eou__ Well , it ’ ll be a rainy day for Northern Utah.we can expect some isolated downpours in the morning . Winds will be coming in from the North East , with gusts reaching twenty-three miles per hour . Salt Lake City can expect the rain to turn to sleet in the evening . Things are looking a bit better for the South.we ’ ll see cloudy skies with a chance of showers . Later in the day , we can expect partlycloudy skies , with a forecast high of thirty-eight degrees . __eou__ You heard it folks ! It ’ s gonna be a cold one ! __eou__ That ’ s right Bill . We will have more later on today on the six o ’ clock news . That ’ s the weather forecast for this morning . __eou__
Wow , American football is more exciting than I thought . __eou__ You ’ re in America now , my British friend . We just call it football . __eou__ Oh , right . So , I can ’ t quite follow what ’ s going on ... who ’ s winning ? __eou__ The Giants are up by three points because of the field goal they kicked , but the Redskins have the ball and there pretty close to the end zone . __eou__ Wow ! What a hit ! __eou__ Yeah , he tackled him so hard his helmet came off . __eou__ Is he ok ? __eou__ It looks like it , he ’ s getting up . __eou__ I guess he hit him too hard ; the referee just called a penalty on the home team . __eou__ The Giants ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Well , here we go again . __eou__ What happened ? Why did everyone get so quiet ? __eou__ The Redskin ’ s quarterback just threw a touchdown pass for seven points . We ’ re losing again . __eou__
I can drink ten cups in fifteen minutes . I ’ m sure . __eou__ You ? You are full of hot air . __eou__
Who's better at chess , Bill or Fred ? __eou__ Both are superb in their skills.Anyhow , Fred is one up on Bill from my point of view . __eou__ You said it . __eou__
Who's the champion in this picture ? __eou__ Let me show you , the one with curly hair . __eou__ He's very handsome , I think . __eou__
Why weren't you at school yesterday ? __eou__ I wasn't feeling really well . __eou__ What was wrong with you ? __eou__ My stomach was upset . __eou__ Do you feel better now ? __eou__ I don't really feel too well yet . __eou__ Do you want anything to make you feel better ? __eou__ No , thanks . I already took some medicine . __eou__ I hope you feel better . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
I hear you are planning to travel abroad . __eou__ Yes . I'm going to the Untied States for travel . What places do you recommend ? __eou__ In my opinion , there are several places you mustn't miss , like Washington D . C , Las Vegas , New York and Los Angeles . __eou__ Someone suggests that I should go to Seattle and Hawaii . __eou__ Yes , you may consider those two places also . Seattle , for example , is worth visiting and there's a very famous museum called Museum of Flight . __eou__ And Seattle is the home of Microsoft and Boeing . That must be a great place . I can't miss it . __eou__
Could I have your name , please ? __eou__ Kevin Belknap . __eou__ How do you spell your last name ? __eou__ B-E-L-K-N-A-P . __eou__ Right . Thank you very much ! __eou__
Do you have the letter of approval of employment ? __eou__ No , I haven't got one . My employment petition hasn't been approved yet . __eou__ In that case , you are not allowed to work in China , until you get the employment petition . __eou__ Ok , I see . __eou__
My pal , you are so nervous recently . You don't need to be like that . __eou__ I am worried about that Arden will display all my drawbacks in the performance review . That will be embarrassing . __eou__ Just use your head . If you were definitely making some big mistakes , you would be informed . __eou__ I had a nightmare last night and I dreamt Arden told me that my performance fell short of his expectation . I was terrified to wake up after hearing that . __eou__ That is merely a dream . Remember , there is always room for us to have further improvement . I think we did the good job in the whole period . __eou__ I know what you are talking about . The performance evaluation process starts from the day we're hired . There is no surprise during the actual review . __eou__
OK , I just want to brief you all on the travel market in Taiwan . To start with , generally speaking , the travel industry in Taiwan focuses mainly on tours . This segment of the industry is well developed . __eou__ Sorry to interrupt , Doris , but can you tell me more about these tour groups , what kind of things they enjoy , and so on ? __eou__ Yes , of course . Most of the time , when they travel , they prefer to do so in large groups accompanied by a guide , who usually takes care of everything , for instance , choosing the restaurants , the itinerary , the mode of transport , and things like that . Another thing is that most travelers to the UK tend to be middle aged , around 40 to 50 or so . This age group is less adventurous ; they like good hotels , and have money to spend . They kind of prefer to stay in the cities where they feel safer . They are not into mountain climbing in Wales or anything . __eou__ I don ’ t mean to interrupt , but can you tell me what plans you have for growing the youth market ? __eou__ Just a moment . I'll tell you about that in a minute . Where was I ? Oh yes . By way of illustration , let ’ s look at the top five destinations in the UK for this kind of traveler over the last five years . If you look at page ten you can see what I mean . In spite of these characteristics of the market , I still think there is room for growth in the youth sector . __eou__ So how do you intend to do that ? __eou__ OK , let me tell you what we ’ Ve been doing . We ’ Ve been in touch with the Wales and Scottish Tourist development offices here in Taiwan and they ’ re interested in working with us to promote their regions to the youth segment . We ’ Ve decided to implement an advertising campaign focusing on the excitement of the activities in those regions . __eou__ May I interrupt you for a moment ? __eou__ Go ahead . __eou__ How much is it going to cost , and who is going to pay ? __eou__ Well , at the moment we are trying to work out those details . We haven't managed to come up with a concrete plan yet , but we are working on it . __eou__ I see . OK . So what ’ s next ? __eou__ Well , our intention is to have some features about these regions in some youth magazines . We ’ re also going to run some ads on TV and put some flyers in places where young people go , like the gym and student organizations . We ’ re making arrangements to have some activities at big shopping malls and department stores around town . __eou__
I think your presentation impressed the client , Daniel . You did a good job . __eou__ Thank you , Mr . Cooper . I hope we get the contract . __eou__
What qualities do you think a business manager should possess ? __eou__ Creativity , the ability to organize , the entrepreneur's spirit , comprehensive knowledge of human studies , ability of gathering information , expert competence of communication and deep professional skills . __eou__ If a client complains about the service of your department , what will you do ? __eou__ If I'm in the service center . I'll listen to the client patiently , and accept the criticism objectively . Then I will have the claim reasonably settled . __eou__
Were you late for work this morning ? __eou__ Yes , I was . I was almost an hour late . __eou__ What did you say to your boss ? __eou__ I said I was terribly sorry . But he said it was quite all right . __eou__ Your boss was really nice . __eou__ No , he didn't scold me because he was late , too . __eou__
What did you do at that company ? __eou__ I helped my boss organize some grand ceremonies and maintained close relations with newspapers , magazines , the radio and the TV . __eou__ If a consumer complains about the quality of your products , what will you do ? __eou__ If I am not in the service center , I will assist others in resolving the consumer complaints . And pass the criticism on to the relevant department . __eou__
That is what we are pursuing . __eou__ We look forward to a further extension of our pleasant business relations . __eou__ A meeting will be arranged to negotiate the relevant stuff . __eou__ That will be good . __eou__
You say he was around average hight . __eou__ Yeah , that's right , around five nine five ten . __eou__ Weight ? __eou__ I'm not sure.Medium , I suppose.Maybe a little on the heavy side . __eou__ Any karks on his face ? __eou__ No , I don't think so . __eou__ Glasses ? __eou__ No . __eou__ what about his hair ? __eou__ Black or dark brown . __eou__ Long or short ? Straight ? Curly ? __eou__ Straight , I think , and about average length . __eou__ Boy , this surely doesn't help us much.It could be anybody.How about his cloth ? What was he wearing . __eou__ Well , he had a Jacked or a Plage shirt . You know the kind of number jack wear . __eou__ Ok , now we are getting some where.Pants ? __eou__ Dark , maybe dark blue maybe black . I'm not sure . __eou__ What kind of shoes ? __eou__ Boots __eou__ Cow while Boots . __eou__ No , hiking boots . Brown ones . __eou__ All right . That nearly done a little.Now I want you to look some pictures . __eou__
Put on the helmet , please . __eou__ Do we need to put on the jackets too ? __eou__ You ’ d better , to protect your clothes . Now please watch your step . __eou__ Thank you . Is the production line fully automated ? __eou__ Well , not fully automated . __eou__ I see . How do you control the quality ? __eou__ All products have to go through five checks in the whole manufacturing process . __eou__ What ’ s the monthly output ? __eou__ One thousand units per month now . But we ’ ll be making 1,200 units beginning with October . __eou__ What ’ s your usual percentage of rejects ? __eou__ About 2 % in normal operations . __eou__ That ’ s wonderful . Is that where the finished products come off ? __eou__ Yes . Shall we take a break now ? __eou__
The government is going to organize a folk-custom activity at the end of the month . And our community is supposed to put on a performance . __eou__ What kind of performance ? A lion dance ? __eou__ Stuff like that but I think the lion dance is a bit too difficult and dangerous . __eou__ Sure , you'll be dancing with lions . What do you expect ? Then what about Range Dance which we did before . __eou__ Good idea . Shall we get everyone in the community ? __eou__ Maybe not . I think we should just focus on the retired people . __eou__ I know that they already have a Range Dance team and then what we need is just to do some rehearsals . __eou__ What about the costumes ? __eou__ We can raise money in the community . You know each family 10 yuan maybe . __eou__ Try something new . We can find a supporting agency . __eou__ Great idea . There is a travel agency nearby who would love to be our sponsor . It's a perfect chance for them to promote ethnic tourism . __eou__
Hello Mike ! Would you like a drink ? __eou__ No , thank you . I had too much to drink yesterday evening . I had a bad hangover this morning . My head felt terrible . __eou__ Were you celebrating something ? __eou__ Yes . It was a friend ’ s birthday party . We drank all kinds of things-beer , wine and spirits . After midnight , we were even drinking cocktails ! __eou__ It ’ s a bad idea to drink a combination of alcoholic drinks . You should stick with one for the whole evening . __eou__ I know , but it was a celebration , you Kwon ? I don ’ t think I ’ Ve see you drunk . __eou__ I usually only drink beer and I rarely drink more than a few pints . __eou__ You are a sensible drinker . Anyway , I ’ m not going to drink any alcohol this evening . I don ’ t ’ want another bad hangover . __eou__ Let me buy you a soft drink then . How about a coke ? __eou__ Yeah . That ’ s a good idea . I heard that coke was first used as a medicine . __eou__ Rally ? ... barman ! ... a large coke with ice and lemon , please ... thanks . Here ’ s the money . __eou__ Are you going to the wine tasting tomorrow ? __eou__ Yes . I thought it might be interesting to learn a little about wine ... __eou__ ... and taste a few ! There will be wines from several countries and an expert to give advice on which wines are good and which ones are not . __eou__ Yes . I ’ m looking forward to it . __eou__
How did you enjoy your family party at “ ginger ’ s ” ? I hear that they have a lovely menu and buffet . __eou__ Oh , it was great . We had seafood buffet . They do one every Friday . The waiters and waitresses are very good . They are very attentive , but don ’ t hang around the table . __eou__ I like the buffets they have , but if often order a la carte , because I don ’ t feel extremely hungry . I like the wine list there too . __eou__ Yes , so do I . they have wines from all over the world . There is a good range of prices to suit every pocket . We ordered some Australian red wine , which tasted delicious and wasn ’ t expensive . __eou__ Some restaurants allow you to take your own wine and just charge you corkage , but the don ’ t do that at “ ginger ’ s ” . what was included in the seafood buffet ? __eou__ They had almost every kind of seafood . There were oyster , shrimp , prawns , crabs , and fish . I ate a lot of smoked salmon . __eou__ Did they have lobster ? __eou__ No , they didn ’ t . you could order it from the menu . I think that lobster is too expensive to be included in the buffet . __eou__ Yes , it probably is . I don ’ t like ordering oysters in restaurants . You never know whether they are fresh . __eou__ I know . I didn ’ t eat any , but a few people in our group did and no one got sick . __eou__ When you eat out , do you usually eat from the buffet ? __eou__ Not usually . I usually just order a main course and have a dessert if I ’ m still hungry afterwards . __eou__ Oh , you don ’ t usually have a starter ? __eou__ No , I might have a soup if it ’ s a cold winter day . __eou__
Mary , please go to the door . I hear the bell . __eou__ It's the mailman , Mother . Here's a letter from Uncle George . __eou__ Give it to me ... How wonderful ! He's coming to visit us . __eou__ When's he coming ? __eou__ He's coming by car on the twenty-fourth . He's staying from thetwenty-fourth to the twenty-sixth . __eou__ Let me look at the calendar . Good ! The twenty-fourth is a Saturday . Is he coming alone ? __eou__ No , he's coming with Aunt Cynthia and the girls . __eou__ Mother , I don't remember the girls . How old are they ? __eou__ Your cousin Fay is fifteen . Rosemary is older than Fay . She's seventeen . __eou__ Are they going to stay here with us ? __eou__ Of course . The girls can stay in your room with you . __eou__ Mother , may we have a party ? __eou__ If you like , but now we have to think about meals and many other things . __eou__ Prepare the list , Mother . I can go shopping . I can go to the small stores.Everyone knows me there . __eou__
Guess who I saw yesterday ? __eou__ I don't know . Who ? __eou__ Avril Lavigen ! __eou__ the Canadian rock singer ? But I heard you had a part-time job yesterday . How did you see her ? __eou__ yeah , I worked as temporary staff in her concert . Look , her poster , a CD ... __eou__ so you're a big fan , eh ? __eou__ not really . But I like some of her songs . She's actually very talented . She's a song writer and fashion and fashion designer , too . __eou__ and she was in a movie once again , right ? __eou__ yes , though I don't think her acting skills are that great . __eou__ what was your impression of her when you saw her in person ? __eou__ she looked sweeter than her pictures . __eou__ did you take a photo with her ? __eou__ no , there were too many people . When she got out of the car , her fans were all screaming , trying to give her flowers and ger her autographs . __eou__ crazy ! __eou__
have you adapted to the lifestyle in China ? __eou__ yeah , almost . But there is one thing . __eou__ what ? __eou__ I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people . I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China , but ... __eou__ what is it ? __eou__ some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others . __eou__ that makes you feel uncomfortable ? __eou__ yeah . we never do that in a public office . __eou__ perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy . __eou__ i have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding . __eou__ well , that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus . __eou__ just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ? __eou__ yeah . __eou__ Oh , I'm shocked . __eou__
so , have you seen all three The Lord of the Rings movies ? __eou__ yes , but I didn't really like the third one at all . __eou__ that's the Return of the King , right ? __eou__ yeah . Even though the customs were brilliant , I didn't think it was as good as the first two . What did you think ? __eou__ I thought the special effects were amazing , but I got a bit confused . The plot was too complicated for me . __eou__ did you read the books before you watched the movies ? __eou__ no . did you ? __eou__ yes , I've read them many times . I think it's much easier to follow for people who were already familiar with all the characters . __eou__ yes , trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me . __eou__ I also think that it was much better in the theatre than at home . __eou__ most movies are . Another problem for me was the film was dubbed in German with English subtitles . __eou__ that happens a lot in non-English speaking countries . __eou__ I heard that The Return of the King was nominated for 11 Oscars . __eou__ actually , they not only had 11 nominations , but they won 11 Oscars , too ! __eou__
You are going to work as my office secretary from next Monday . Right now I want to show you the rules of our company . __eou__ Thank you for your instruction . I really need to know the rules before I play the game , so I can know more about our company . __eou__ The working hours are from 9:00 to 11:30 in the morning and from 1:30 to 5:30 in the afternoon . Make sure never to be late or absent . Every time you should use the employee card to show you are present whenever you come into the company . __eou__ Set your heart at rest . I keep this in my mind . __eou__ In my opinion , a secretary must be familiar with office routine and try to do some things by you . This is the filing cabinet and any document or file you may need . And you should file these documents in alphabetical order . __eou__
Good morning , and welcome to Live Tech . It is my honor to make this presentation for you . Let me begin by explaining some of our digital cameras ' selling points . You will see immediately that they are very stylish , but what you can't see is the cutting-edge technology inside . All of our cameras are light , compact , and easy to use . __eou__ Can I take a look at one of those ? __eou__ Be my guest . Live Tech's digital cameras combine point-and-shoot simplicity with the ability to easily turn pictures into great-looking prints . Furthermore , it allows users to transfer pictures to a computer while the camera recharges . __eou__ Can I take a picture of you ? Seeing is believing . __eou__ Sure , Just push the button , like ... __eou__ I think I can figure this out . Let's see if this works as advertised . Say ' cheese ! ' __eou__ I think you will find these are the best digital cameras on the market today . __eou__ I think the quality of the photos will speak for themselves . __eou__
hi , Betty.what ' s up ? __eou__ nothing special . how about you ? Are you used to the life here in the States ? __eou__ everything has been fine for the past several months . __eou__ great ! __eou__ well , I wish someone could talk to me about Western table manners __eou__ sounds interesting . Where did you get the idea ? __eou__ as you know , table manners in China are quite different from those of Westerners . __eou__ absolutely . that's because both of us have distinctive cultural features . __eou__ for example , in China , it's okay to talk while eating . However , you may regard it as rude . __eou__ yes . this must be a huge difference . __eou__ can you think of anything else ? __eou__ sure . We tend to think that the slower on eats , the more polite one seems . __eou__ I didn't know that before . __eou__ and we never sip or slurp the soup loudly . we quietly like little mouthfuls . __eou__ i got it . i'll bear it in mind . __eou__ don't worry . i'm sure our etiquette will become a natural part of your behavior as time goes by . __eou__ I hope so . __eou__
Well , that was an interesting documentary ! __eou__ For sure ! I didn ’ t really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the US . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ Well , they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401K ? __eou__ Yeah , I know it sounds weird , but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement . Through a you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan . Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire , you can rest peacefully on your nest egg . __eou__ That ’ s interesting and logical I guess . In my country , we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund , but most people don ’ t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that . __eou__ That seems a bit unstable don ’ t you think ? __eou__ Yeah , but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions , so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank . __eou__ I ’ Ve been thinking of doing that lately ! I don ’ t want some banker to run off with my money ! __eou__
Let's see . I had the salmon starter which was £ 5.90 and my Pizza was £ 8.25 . __eou__ I had the soup and bruschetta which all together is £ 4.50 and my trout for the main course was £ 12 . __eou__ So that's £ 14.15 for me and £ 16.50 for you . __eou__ Yes and shall we go fifty-fifty for the wine ? __eou__ Yes , so that's an extra £ 6 for both of us . __eou__ So now your bill comes to £ 20.15 and I need to pay £ 22.50 . __eou__ And I had a dessert - that's another £ 3.50 . And you had coffee which is £ 2 . __eou__ And is that all ? __eou__ Yes , this is everything on the list . __eou__ So now my bill is £ 24.50 and yours come to £ 23.65 . Is that correct ? __eou__ Yes , that's exactly it . How much tip shall we give the waiter ? __eou__ I think £ 5 would be good . __eou__
They must have got in through the kitchen window . __eou__ If only we'd remember to close it . __eou__ I am afraid your diamond bracelet has gone , darling ! __eou__ I wish I'd put it in the bank . __eou__ Look ! they've taken your fur coat too . __eou__ I know , I am sorry I ever bought it . __eou__ I noticed they've taken our radio and left the television . __eou__ It's a pity they didn't take the tele . We need a new one . Anyway we can claim for all this from the insurance company . __eou__ I wish we could , but we can't , you see , we are not insured . __eou__
Have you heard that Tom and his wife divorced ? __eou__ I didn't hear that . But I can deduce the reason . __eou__ Really ? Say it ! __eou__ Tom is a kind guy , but addicted to gambling . He spends all his time gambling in the casino . And his wife can't put up with his incessant gambling any longer , so she divorced him . Is that right ? __eou__ Yeah , quite right . Gambling broke up a happy family . __eou__ Yeah ! Gambling is often a curse . By gambling we lose time and treasure , two things most precious to a man . __eou__ Besides that , many people took to gambling and got in over their heads , and gradually ruined themselves . __eou__ In a word , gambling is a vice . We should be away from it . __eou__
Annie , what is troubling you ? You look unhappy . __eou__ A man is pursuing me . He was my schoolmate in college , and he has been carrying a torch for me for three years . __eou__ Do you like him ? __eou__ Yes , I do like him . __eou__ Then why are you hesitating ? __eou__ You know that I have had a series of miserable relationships . Last summer , I fell in love with John . But the romance blossomed for six or seven weeks , and then wilted . __eou__ One love drives out another . You shouldn't be afraid to start a new relationship . __eou__ Maybe you are right . __eou__
It sounds that you have a high opinion of him . __eou__ He is an all-right guy . I have no bone to pick with him . __eou__ Birds of feather flock together . __eou__ But he is not a fine wether friend who could sell you down the river . __eou__ You cannot judge a person that way . I have a hunch that he is a sly dog . __eou__ Depends on with whom . He may be doing things on the sly , but he is honest with me . I trust him . __eou__ You can never tell . He might do you in when he sees an angle in doing it . __eou__
How do you know ? I thought Taiwanese people didn't have garage sales . __eou__ You're right . We're not really into used stuff . __eou__ Well , I've grown to like second-hand things . I wouldn't have gotten through university without them ! __eou__ There aren't many places that sell used things in Taiwan , besides auction websites . __eou__ I use those sites . Hey ! Let's go check out a flea market later . __eou__ Great ! I can teach you men a thing or two about shopping ! __eou__
Joanne , let ’ s not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is , okay ? Let ’ s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly , so we can go our separate ways , alright ? __eou__ Fine with me . I just want to get this over with . It ’ s important we make a clean break . I should have signed a pre-nup . __eou__ What was that ? __eou__ Nothing ! Anyway , you ’ re right , there ’ s no reason this has to be nasty.My lawyer tells me you ’ Ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property , as well as the custody agreement - I keep the cat and you get the dog . So that ’ s done ... finally . __eou__ Let ’ s not go there , Joanne ! Ok , so let ’ s start with the record collection , I ’ ll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back . __eou__ Fine , but I ’ m keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me . __eou__ I believe that was a wedding present to both of us , Joanne . And you hardly ever use it ! __eou__ He ’ s my grandfather , and he never really liked you anyway ! __eou__ Whatever ! Alright , I ’ ll concede the silly gramophone , if you ’ ll agree that I get the silver tea set . __eou__ How typical , when are you ever going to use a silver tea set ? Fine ! I don ’ t want to drag this out any longer than necessary . What ’ s next ? What about these old photographs ? __eou__ Which ones ? Let me have a look.Wow , look at that ! That brings back memories ... That ? __eou__ Our trip to Italy ! I remember that day . We were going to visit the Trev fountain , and we got caught in the rain ... __eou__ ... and you looked so adorable with your hair all wet . I had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley , smiling and laughing in the rain ... __eou__ Oh , we really did have fun back then , didn ’ t we ? __eou__ Oh , Joanne , are we making a big mistake ? I know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can ’ t reconcile and try again ? I still love you . __eou__ Oh Jeff ! I love you too ! I ’ m so glad we didn ’ t have to decide who keeps the motorcycle . __eou__ The motorcycle ? But that ’ s mine ! __eou__
It's a beautiful day , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , isn't it . __eou__ Do you now the temperature today ? __eou__ It's beautiful 75 degrees . __eou__ How nice . I hope the weather will stay like this for the whole week . I'm going on the canoe trip this weekend . __eou__ Not a good plan . The TV weather forecast says the hurricane is coming this weekend , and the temperature will also drop to 66 degrees . __eou__ What a nuisance ! Every time I plan to go canoeing or camping , a storm comes along . The sky gets dark , the wind starts to howl and the temperature drops.Well , I'd better stay home . __eou__ I never make any definite weekend plan until Friday morning . Then after listening to the weather temperature , I make my plans . __eou__ That's smart . I'm going to start doing the same thing . __eou__
Daddy , how are you going to spend your weekends ? __eou__ I need to finish my research paper . __eou__ Could you go with me to climb Kiang Shan ? __eou__ Honey , I am sorry I have no time . __eou__ Oh , Daddy , you should do more exercise . You are getting a little heavy . __eou__ I am afraid you are right . Recently , even going upstairs makes me out of breath . __eou__ Then go climbing with me , Daddy . Mountain climbing can build your muscles like Popeyes . __eou__ Terrific ! It is also a good exercise to keep me fit . __eou__ I give you my word , you must feel refreshed after mountain climbing . __eou__ OK , I'll go . __eou__ That's a deal . __eou__ Sure . __eou__
Well , thank you . Mr.Parry , for all your information . Just one more question . __eou__ Yes , sir ? __eou__ Do you play any sports or games ? __eou__ I used to play football regularly when I was at university . And I used to do athletics in the summer . __eou__ And what athletics did you play ? Can you remember ? __eou__ I was a runner-a long-distance runner . __eou__ And now ? __eou__ No . I'm afraid I haven't had time since I got married . __eou__ Well , thank you again for coming to see us . But just remember that we like people who join the company to play in the company sports teams . __eou__ Certainly , sir . __eou__
My mother bought me a new video game . __eou__ What's it like ? __eou__ Well , the hero is a Super Warrior . He has to fight the bad guys to find the treasure . __eou__ Who are the bad guys ? __eou__ There are a lot ! Two really bad ones are Giant Monster and Human Spider . __eou__ Wow ! Where's the treasure ? __eou__ It's in a dungeon , under a castle . __eou__ How do you find it ? __eou__ It's not easy to find . Anyway , you can come to my home after school today and try . __eou__ Great ! __eou__
Good evening , madam . May I help you ? __eou__ I want a facial . But this is the first time I've come here , so can you tell me how you do it ? __eou__ Sure . Most facials start with a thorough cleaning . Then we usually use a toner to invigorate the skin , followed by exfoliation treatment-a peeling mask or scrub that removes the dead cells that make the skin lock dull . After that , we'll massage your face and neck with oil or cream to improve the circulation and relieve the tension , followed by a mask to moisturize and soften the skin . __eou__ That's exactly what I want . How long does it take ? __eou__ We have half-hour and one-hour treatments . __eou__ What's the regular price ? __eou__ Well , the half-hour facial costs 50 yuan and the one-hour costs 80 yuan . If you want make-up , another 20 yuan will do . __eou__ Good , I will take the one hour facial with make-up . __eou__ That's fine , madam . __eou__ By the way , could you give me a manicure ? Use a light nail-polish , please . __eou__ Yes , madam . __eou__
Can your dog do any tricks ? __eou__ Sure he can . He can shake hands , roll over , and even play dead . __eou__ I wish I had a dog . My cat can't do any tricks . __eou__ Yeah , but sometimes Bingo wants to play with me , but I don't have time . __eou__ So who takes care of him then ? __eou__ My little brother likes to play with him . He even gives him a bath every week . __eou__ I can't do that with my cat . She hates water . __eou__ You know , you're right . Maybe you should get a dog . __eou__
The air conditioning is not working ! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here ! __eou__ Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up . __eou__ That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ’ s really annoying ! __eou__ Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ’ s why the parking lot was flooded . __eou__ I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him . __eou__
Bob , put on your shoes , your feet are really smelly . __eou__ No foot gives out scent . __eou__ But don't forget you are in a cafe . __eou__ Never mind , the odour of my feet will quicken their eating speed . __eou__ I simply can't bear your barbaric behavior . __eou__ Don ’ t pretend you are a good God . __eou__ You should feel shameful for your behavior . __eou__ I've never experienced such a kind of feeling . __eou__ I'm really sick of you . __eou__
It seems to me that you are on very good terms with him . __eou__ We actually met at a dance party . He fell for me . __eou__ He must be all over you the first time he saw you . __eou__ He said that I put all other girls in the shade . __eou__ That means he was head over heels in love with you . __eou__ Well , he indeed likes me . __eou__ But I think he can't hold a candle to you . I don't think he has ever popped the question . __eou__ No , he is the sort of man who likes to hide his candle under a bushel . __eou__
It's nice and bright today , isn't it ? __eou__ Yeah.The autumn is marvelous here . __eou__ How about winter ? __eou__ That's a hard time.The air is cold and damp , and the road is often icy . __eou__ It's boring , right ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Do you get much rain during the summer ? __eou__ Plenty.We never worry about lack of rainwater in our area . __eou__ So you should bring an umbrella often . __eou__ That's right . __eou__
Guess who I saw yesterday ? __eou__ Who ? __eou__ My cousin Monk . Have you seen her lately ? __eou__ Not for a couple of years . What happened to her ? __eou__ Nothing exactly . She's grown into a very attractive young lady . __eou__ Oh , she is . __eou__ You know , her long lovely blond hair and beautiful blue eyes really make her stand out from others . __eou__ Not surprising . I bet she's very tall and slim . __eou__ Yean . Around five feet five inches tall . __eou__
Hi Steve . What do you think of the new supplier ? __eou__ We haven't had any problems so far . They offer a 24 - hour technical back-up service . We've called them in three times this month . They always arrive within a couple of hours . __eou__ That's good service . Do we have to pay extra for that ? __eou__ No . There's no call-out fee . It's included in the annual service contract . __eou__
Did you see the letter I got from Bradford Films ? They sent it in response to your phone call last week . __eou__ If they wanted to say something about my call last week , why didn ’ t they sand it to me ? __eou__ I guess they must not have your contact information , so they sent it addressed in care of your department head . Anyhow , they wrote to confirm in writing what you discussed about the Milton contract . __eou__ Can I see it for a second ? __eou__ Sure , here it is ... __eou__ Dear Mr . Clark , Further to our telephone call last Friday , I am writing to confirm our meeting on july 21 . As we discusses , our meeting is to review the contract details . __eou__ Did they ask you to send the files beforehand ? __eou__ Let ’ s see , ” we would e grateful if you could please send related materials to our office prior to our meeting . ” It looks like ... hey , was there anything else sent along with this letter ? __eou__ I don't think so , why do you ask ? __eou__ The letter reads , “ please find enclosed a copy of our agenda for your review . ” I don ’ t see anything else in the envelope ... __eou__ Maybe they forgot to attach it to the letter . You should give them another call . __eou__
Susan , Is the manager in this office ? __eou__ Yes . But he is meeting a client . __eou__ Oh , that's too bad . I just got a phone call saying that my wife is now in the hospital . She is going to deliver a baby . I must take the day off to go to the hospital . May I talk to him to ask for leave ? __eou__ I am afraid not , but I think I could convey your leave to him after the client goes . __eou__ Oh , that's very kind of you . Thank you very much . I've got to go . __eou__
Sorry to bother you sir , but I have some bad news . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ Well , the stock market just took a huge plunge and we ’ Ve lost a lot of money ! __eou__ What do you mean ? What happened ? __eou__ There are many factors that weigh in , but NASDAQ is down 200 points , the DOW JONES indicator also suffered ! Our portfolio is worth half of what it was worth points week ago . __eou__ How is this possible ? You are supposed to be talking to our stockbrokers and making sure that our securities and investments are safe and making a profitable return ! __eou__ I know sir ! We didn ’ t expect a bull market to become a bear market all of a sudden . On the other hand , you still have some high yield trash bonds and government bonds that will give us enough liquidity to cut our loses and reinvest in emerging markets . We could potentially make this tragedy work for us and make us think outside the box . __eou__ Do what you have to do ! One other thing , don ’ t tell the rest of the stockholders about this . If they find out , it ’ s the end of this company ! __eou__
Julia , Julia , Julia . My daring Julia , what's wrong with you ? __eou__ Steven , are you talking to me ? __eou__ Yes , I have called you three times . What makes you in a daze ? __eou__ I was thinking about the accident I saw in the morning . I was petrified when two cars collided . I witnessed the traffic accident . __eou__ Did someone get hurt ? __eou__ A driver died instantly . The other one was badly hurt . A poor boy called Peter was killed in the accident too . __eou__ What a terrible accident ! Who should be responsible for this traffic accident ? __eou__ I think both . They drove too fast . What's worse , one of them was drunk . __eou__ Why do some guys like to drive so fast when they are drunk ? __eou__ I don ’ t understand . Maybe they feel they are okay and driving fast seems very cool . __eou__
What's wrong ? __eou__ I have a headache . These past few days I've been living off painkillers . Man , I feel like my head is going to explode . __eou__ You should get acupuncture treatment . My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her . __eou__ The results are too slow . On top of that , just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me . __eou__ They don't just randomly stick you , they find your pressure points . The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment , restoring the body's " chi " . __eou__ But I get scared the moment I see a needle . How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end ? __eou__ The needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options . __eou__ Scraping is too terrifying . When they finish scrapping , your body is all red , as if you were just tortured . Cupping is the same , your body ends up with red circles all over . It looks like someone beat you up . __eou__ This only signifies that the toxins have left the body . Actually , there is only discomfort during the treatment process . Once it's over you feel very comfortable . __eou__ Chinese medicine is strange . The patients are already ill , and then the doctor makes them suffer more . __eou__ This is the only way to get at the problem . Anyway , if you want to relieve the pain , you are just going to have to be tough and do it . __eou__ Forget it . I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself . In a little while I'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap . __eou__
Before we begin eating , I'd like to present everyone with a gift from Taiwan . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ It's a Taiwanese puppet doll . __eou__ It's huge ! __eou__ Yeah . They're usually this big . __eou__ The craftsmanship is excellent . __eou__ All the parts work . __eou__ Thank you so much . __eou__ Don't mention it . __eou__
Hi , Janice . Our first weekend after being employed is coming . Show me your plan . __eou__ My mom phoned me this morning , and asked me to go back home to have housework chores . __eou__ What are you assigned to do ? __eou__ God knows . Speaking of chores , I would rather do some washing than cooking . __eou__ For me , I think I will iron my shirt and trousers . Actually , weekends tend to be the most hectic day in the whole week . __eou__ I really hope that I could sleep like a log all through two nights . But ... Some one said that weekends are a bit like rainbows ; they look good from a distance but disappear before we get up close to them . __eou__ I couldn't agree more . __eou__
It is so quiet here . I like the place . __eou__ Me too . __eou__ I can't stand the loud noise in the city . __eou__ Yes , sometimes I can hardly get asleep at night . __eou__ I hope I can stay here longer . __eou__ When will your vacation end ? __eou__ The day after tomorrow . __eou__ You will go back tomorrow , right ? __eou__ Yes , you are right . __eou__
Sometimes you look like brains , and sometimes you are simple a Barbie Doll . __eou__ I don ’ t know whether I am a Barbie Doll or you are one . __eou__ Maybe I am a Barbie Doll , but I won ’ t do Barbie Doll things . __eou__ Well , I am not going to flog a dead horse . Let get down to our brass tasks and tidy these things up . __eou__
Old Dyson looks as if he maybe kick the bucket any day . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ I ’ Ve ever seen a living being looked so thin . __eou__ Really ? In my eyes it ’ s normal , as an old man , to be thin is better than to be fat . __eou__ Maybe you are right . __eou__
Hi , my name ’ s Karl . My wife and I are moving in next door . __eou__ Hello , Karl . I ’ m Chuck Jones . We ’ re going to be neighbors . __eou__ I ’ m happy to meet you . It seems everyone in town is so friendly . __eou__ This is a small town , and we like to be neighborly . We know everyone who lives around here . __eou__ Well , I ’ m from Chicago . There few people take the time to get to know their neighbors . __eou__ So , tell me , Karl , hyoid you come all the way to Minnesota to live ? __eou__ We wanted to live in a more peaceful community and have more space . Another reason is , we can afford to buy a home here , but we can ’ t in Chicago ! __eou__
You look so tan and healthy ! __eou__ Thanks . I just got back from summer camp . __eou__ How was it ? __eou__ Great . I got to try so many things for the first time . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ I went sailing , fishing , and horseback riding . __eou__ I ’ m so jealous . __eou__ The counselors were so nice too . It was the best summer ever . Except for all those mosquitoes ! __eou__
Ladies and gentlemen , we are heading towards the first spot of our trip-the Louvre . __eou__ Wonderful . That's a place famous for its arts . __eou__ Yes . There are so many famous paintings on show . I am sure it will be an unforgettable trip . __eou__ Surely it will be . By the way , when will we get there ? __eou__ Half an hours later . __eou__
What sights are included on the tour ? Is the entire time spent in Paris ? __eou__ All of the major sights are included . You'll visit the Louvre , the Eiffel Tower and all of the top museums . You'll also take a day trip out of Paris to Versailles . __eou__ Can you fax a copy of the tour itinerary to me ? __eou__ Of course . Just give me your fax number . __eou__ It's 212-331-7600 . __eou__ Okay . I'll fax the itinerary to you immediately . __eou__
Your silk garments have aroused much interest in our country ever since our first order was put on the market . We have no doubt we can do better this year if you appoint us your sales agent . __eou__ We appreciate your intention , but the amount of your orders last year was moderate . __eou__ That's true . However at the Fair last March , people were so interested in Chinese garments that the demand this year will surely increase . __eou__ Do you think it will help if we appoint a local agent ? __eou__ I'm sure it will , if we are appointed your agent . Your garments are attractive , and we , a well-established importer with multiple sales channels , can boost the sales . __eou__ Well , we'll consider your proposal . __eou__
good afternoon , madam . How can I help you ? __eou__ well , I am a little bit out of shape . I think I should get some exercise to keep fit . what kind of service do you offer ? __eou__ first of all , we'll tailor a work-out plan according to your physical conditions and your personal needs . __eou__ how can you get that done ? __eou__ well , we give each of our customers a qualified personal trainer . The trainer will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work-out plan . __eou__ what else ? __eou__ since everyone is different , your personal trainer will help you find out all the exercise equipments that are suitable for you fitness level . Then you'llbe taught all the necessary techniques to us __eou__ sounds pretty good . How much do you charge ? __eou__ that depends . We offer membership for one month , half a year and one year . __eou__ perhaps one month . I'll just have a try at first . __eou__ wise decision . that is 400 yuan . You'll find it's totally worth it . __eou__ OK , I'll take it . __eou__
Hi , Xavier . I'd like to go over the list of jobs for next week's maintenance shut . __eou__ Sure . We've got a lot to do in a short time . We're planning to shut the line at midday on Wednesday and start up again at 6 pm the following day . We might need to extend the shut by about six hours . __eou__ Our production people won't be happy about that . We've got a full order book at the moment . Is there any way you could speed things up ? __eou__ Not really . We need to dismantle the conveyor belt and replace the rollers . __eou__
John hasn't turned up and Stefan is ill . Do we have anyone on stand-by ? __eou__ I'm afraid not , we're very short-staffed at the moment . Can you ask the shift supervisor to ask one of his team to do some overtime ? Perhaps Tommy can stand in for an hour or two until we find a replacement . __eou__
That's the warehouse where the large items of office equipment are stored . __eou__ If I ordered a desk today , how would it be before I got delivery in Scotland ? __eou__ Well , I think perhaps you'd better speak to our Production Manager , Mr . Yao . You'll meet him when we go over to the factory . __eou__
We did a survey on your job performance . __eou__ How did I do ? __eou__ Not so good . Lots of complains . __eou__ Really ? I thought I was doing well . __eou__ Your performance so far is not quite in line with what we expect for our executives . I hope I ’ Ve made my point . __eou__

It is wonderful to listen to the monks chanting while listening to the soothing sound of the winds in the pine trees . __eou__ I'm getting a little excited now . What clothes should I wear ? __eou__ Take some thick clothes with you . It is rather cold there at night .

Hey , Mike . You've been surfing the Net for quite a while . What on earth are you searching for ? __eou__ It's something relative hackers . I often hear people talking about them , but I don't know much about them . __eou__ Well , roughly speaking , a hacker is a computer buff . __eou__ You mean a guy using enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the computer ? __eou__ You can say that . __eou__ But why are people always having such a negative attitude towards them ? __eou__ They must have mixed hackers with crackers . __eou__ What is crackers then ? __eou__ There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers , but they aren't . They break into computers and break the phone system . Real hackers call these people crackers , and want nothing to do with them . __eou__ So they are two totally different concepts . __eou__ Well , the real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy , irresponsible and not very bright , and feel that being able to break security does make you a hacker any more than being able to start cars without keys makes you an automotive engineer . Unfortunately , many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word hacker to describe crackers . This irritates real hackers to no end . __eou__ I see . Then the basic different is , hackers build things , crackers break them . __eou__ You got it . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__ You are welcome . __eou__

Stephanie ! Did you just get to school ? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning ! That was about an hour and a half ago . This happens all the time ! Why do you always take so long __eou__ It ’ s a skill . What can I say ? I don ’ t know why , I just have a long routine . __eou__ Please explain because it makes no sense to me . How can a girl ’ s routine be so complicated ? You get up , you shower , you get dressed , you brush your teeth , you ’ re out the door . Half an hour , tops . __eou__ Jacob , you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling . I don ’ t . I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings . Every day , I wake up and head straight for the shower . Every second day , I wash my hair . If it ’ s a hair-washing day , I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily . Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too . Because my hair is so long , I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes . Afterwards , I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew . I take a long time to get dressed in the morning . Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning . In all , getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair . From time to time I ’ ll put my hair up , butoften times I bloody it straight . And then , because of the texture of my hair , I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing . That ’ s another twenty minutes or so . After that , I have my daily makeup routine . __eou__ True , I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on , even when you show up to class in sweatpants . Tell me , how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning ? __eou__ Not funny . __eou__

It blinks off and on . __eou__ Jen , it's not alive ... but it does look user-friendly . __eou__ I would look so cool carrying this around ! __eou__
What do you say we stop in at that Burger King over there and grab a bite ? __eou__ Forget it ! If you think I ’ d ever set foot that inferior restaurant again , you gotta be nuts . Last time I ate that food , almost vomited . The service in there is terrible . It was the first time I ever stiffed a waiter __eou__ Yeah , not seeing a single person anywhere informed me . Hey ! How about that one over there ? __eou__ Oh , give me a break ! That place is too lavish for us . __eou__ Easy . It ’ s on me . __eou__ In that case , I ’ m right behind you . __eou__
Mike , what are you doing tonight ? __eou__ Nothing special . I just want to get plastered . __eou__ I don't feel like drinking tonight . I'm gonna hang out at YY's . __eou__ YY's ? That place is boring . How about Xara's ? It's real classy , and they keep the place spin and span . __eou__ Yeah , but it's expensive . Nah , I'm going to YY's . __eou__ On second thought , I think I'll join you . __eou__ They ' Ve just renovated the place . You may be surprised . __eou__ Wow , they really went to town on this place ! __eou__ Quite a difference , huh ? __eou__ Sure is . Waiter , bring us two drafts , please . __eou__ Ah hah.Thought you were't drinking . __eou__ When in Rome , do as the Romans do . __eou__
How could you handle living in such a big family ? Does everyone get along ? __eou__ Sure . We love each other and take care of each other . __eou__ In such a big family , there must be a head . Who's the head of your family ? __eou__ My grandpa . He has the final word about almost everything . My grandpa is “ President , ” and Grandma is “ Vice-President . ” My parents , uncles and aunts try to arrive at a consensus on important questions . __eou__ Is a family like yours common in South Korea ? __eou__ No . Not anymore.Mine is highly educated but traditional family . Most South Korea families today are a lot smaller . In traditional families , the old people are well respected and taken good care of . Ho __eou__ My family setup is a bit different . In New York city , there're only three people , my mother , my stepfather and me . During this summertime , I fly out to California and live with my dad . Dad's getting __eou__ Of course there'll be a room for you ! __eou__ To be blunt , maybe I won't be able to get along with his new wife or her kids . __eou__ Yours is a modern family . I'm sure your dad loves you and would want you to stay for the summer . You just need to try your best to get along with your new stepmother and her boys . __eou__ But four boys ! __eou__ It will be a new experience , and you might as well learn to adjust to changes . __eou__ You are right , I guess.The world keeps changing , and so do families . But I like a small-sized or medium-sized family where everybody is equal to everybody else . That's what I want . __eou__ It is good to have goals in life . If California doesn't work out , come and visit me in Korea , OK ? __eou__ That's a great idea ! __eou__ We could share a room ! It would be fun . And we could do some traveling around Korea . You could see for yourself what life in a big family is like ! __eou__ That sounds like an excellent offer . I might take you up on that . Thank you for the wonderful invitation . __eou__
Good afternoon . I come here specially to pick up my tickets . I booked it last month.This is my reservation note . __eou__ I am terribly sorry . You didn't come to reconfirm recently.You should have come to pick up your ticket three days ago since it's an international flight , any reservation without reconfirmation within 72 hours will be cancelled . __eou__ But I have been so busy all these days.Well , is there any other ticket available ? I want the next one . __eou__
Is your application successful ? __eou__ Yes , they notify me to work next week . __eou__ Where on earth will you work in ? __eou__ It is a pretty big mechanical company . I am assigned to work in the assembly shop . __eou__ How long will you work a day ? __eou__ My working hours aren ’ t fixed , sometimes I do the day shift , sometimes the night shift . In all , about 8 hours . __eou__ That ’ s rather hard . __eou__ But it matches my major . __eou__ How will you get your pay ? __eou__ My wage depends on production results . __eou__ What sort of welfare facilities does your company provide ? __eou__ The company provides labor insurance for all employees , as well as fine retirement policy . __eou__ Is there a union ? __eou__ There is the company union , but it really shares the same aims as the management . __eou__ So you must consider dearly before you go to work . __eou__ I will . __eou__
Excuse me . Do you mind telling me the time when the recruitment will officially start ? __eou__ It will be held on October 15th . __eou__ Should I arrive early or on time ? __eou__ You'd better be early in case that you may be late because of traffic jam . That will put you in a insurmountable place . __eou__
Morning , Tom ! What are you doing over there ? Learning to dance ? __eou__ Can't you see ? I'm practicing tai chi ! __eou__ Oh , my goodness . I'm sorry . But I don't think tai chi is to be practiced like that . __eou__ I'm just a beginner . Did my poses make me the butt of jokes ? __eou__ Well , they just look a bit funny . but far from making a laughing stock out of you . __eou__ So , is there anything wrong with my strokes ? __eou__ To begin with , you should keep your neck erect upward at any time . __eou__ Like this ? __eou__ Good ! And then , the entire body . Never incline your body forward or backward . Take care to regulate the point of balance . Place it at your waist . __eou__ Did I do it right ? __eou__ No ! You should avoid sticking out your belly . Keep your hip steady . Don't swing . __eou__ What should I do with my legs then ? __eou__ Oh , yes , things are quite different with the limbs . Keep your knees bent a little . Right , they should be rich in elasticity . Move slowly when you shift your centre of gravity from one leg to another . __eou__ Fantastic ! I guess the same is true with the arms , right ? __eou__ Exactly ! Move your arms in a relaxed manner . Well . don't stretch yourfingers stiffly . Just keep them in a natural shape . __eou__
What's in the box ? __eou__ Sandy , I think we made a mistake ... __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ It's a cute little teddy bear ! __eou__ How sweet ! Maybe he was just a shy guy who had a crush on you ! __eou__ And look what we did to him ! Hey ... he left me his business card . __eou__ Wow ! Call him tonight ! You guys will really have an interesting love story to tell everyone ! __eou__
This broth is wonderful . What's in it ? __eou__ Lamb and beef . It will get even tastier when we add the veggies ! __eou__ Hey ! Watch out ! You're using the same spoon for both broths ! __eou__ So ? __eou__ You're getting that hot stuff in my mild broth ! __eou__ You'll be OK . It's just a little bit ... __eou__
Could you introduce some whitening products for me ? __eou__ Please forgive me just being frankly , madam . You don't need whitening products because you look pretty white . But you have freckles on your face . __eou__ Then what kind of product can fade freckles ? __eou__ I recommend Nisei products . This brand has a face cream which is effective on fading freckles . __eou__ How much is it ? __eou__ 419 yuan . __eou__ It is too expensive for me . Do you have something cheaper ? __eou__ I'm afraid there isn't . __eou__
Mom , can we get cable TV or a satellite dish ? __eou__ It costs money , dear . What ’ s wrong with the regular television stations ? __eou__ The shows are dull and they ’ re too many advertisements . __eou__ Well , you already watch too much TV instead of doing your homework , anyway . __eou__ There ’ re educational stations too . I could learn while I watched TV . __eou__ Well , that ’ s true , but you ’ d probably only watch cartoons and action movies . __eou__ No I wouldn ’ t ... can ’ t we get cable ? Everybody has cable . __eou__ Well , if everybody jumped off a bridge , would you jump too ? __eou__ Mom ! ! ! Please . All my friends have had it for years . __eou__ Get new friends . __eou__ Why are you always so mean ? __eou__ Because you ’ d end up spoiled rotten if I wasn ’ t . __eou__ I could help pay for it . __eou__ Let ’ s see how your grades are this semester , and maybe I ’ ll talk to your father about it . __eou__ O . K . Thanks , Mom ! __eou__
do you like cooking , Julia ? __eou__ I really enjoy it , especially when it ends up tasting good ! __eou__ how often do you usually cook ? __eou__ I usually make a few salads for lunch throughout the week and I make dinner about 6 times a week . __eou__ that's a lot of cooking . You must save a lot of money by eating at home so much . __eou__ I do . If you cook at home , you can eat healthy food cheaply . __eou__ what kind of dishes do you usually make ? __eou__ I almost always make either a beef roast or a chicken roast with asparagus , parsnips , peas , carrots and potatoes on Sundays . __eou__ do you make a lot of traditional British food ? __eou__ aside from the Sunday roast , we usually eat dangers and mash , toad-in-the-hole , or fish'n chips once a week . __eou__ how about spicy food ? __eou__ my family loves spicy food . We often eat Chinese , Thai , Indian , or Mexican food when we're in the mood for spice . __eou__ what's your favorite dish to make ? __eou__ I absolutely love making mousaka , which is a Greek dish with eggplant . But it takes a lot of time , so I don ’ t often make it . __eou__
It seems that you get antsy when you hear I praise another guy . __eou__ I get antsy not because you praise a guy , but because you may be taken for a ride by a guy like him . __eou__ How come you think of him that way ? __eou__ Because you seem to have lost your vigilance . You should be on the watch out . __eou__ I have no reason to distrust him . He's never caused any harm . __eou__ Isn't there anything that sounds fishy ? __eou__ Nothing smells a rat . I told you that he's an all-right guy . __eou__ All-right guy ? All right . Let's talk about something else instead . __eou__
Hi Amy , you look very happy . __eou__ Yes , I'm very pleased . I've just got two tickets to see the Olympic opening ceremony . __eou__ Wow . You must be very excited . __eou__ I certainly am . I would have been very disappointed if I hadn ’ t got them . __eou__ Shall we go to a restaurant to celebrate ? __eou__ What a good idea . I'm quite hungry . __eou__ Me too . I feel very thirsty as well . __eou__ Let ’ s go then . __eou__
My wife and I didn't used to spend this much money . __eou__ What's changed ? __eou__ My wife has been pregnant for 7 months . __eou__ I see . I guess diapers and baby food are expensive.Bringing up children is not easy . __eou__ My wife will be going back to work soon . __eou__ You should have more money then . __eou__ Yes.We will need milk powder and bassinet . __eou__
I'll tell you something that's good about action movies . The special effects are great ! __eou__ But they are so silly ! They're not art ! __eou__ That's just your personal prejudice . Do you know who was the director of the movie Titanic ? __eou__ James Cameron , of course . __eou__ Well , did you know he was also the director of The Terminator ? __eou__ Well , nobody's perfect ! __eou__
Tell me , Mr . Han . What do you suggest if we establish long term business relations ? __eou__ Surely it's a sound idea , Mr . Joey . But I have a few questions for you first . __eou__ I am all ears . __eou__ First , can I know something about your financial situations ? __eou__ Sure . As for our financial situation , you can inquire about them in the national bank . They handle all our financial documents . __eou__ Thank you . And how is your business in the clothing business circle ? __eou__ A very good question . It's very honorable for me to tell you that our business relations cover all over the world and they all have very good business reputation . __eou__ Then what do you deal with ? __eou__ We deal with kid's clothing , women's clothing , and men's clothing . You name it we deal with it . __eou__ That's nice . They provided us with convenient choice . __eou__ As for the regular customers , we have some favorable terms for them . __eou__ I'd like to hear that . __eou__ For the substantial regular customers , we offer 5 % commissions . __eou__ That sounds attractive , all right , how about that we sign a one year contract ? __eou__ Fabulous . I will get the contract ready shortly . __eou__
Do you give me a bonus ? __eou__ Yes . We don ’ t give bonus every month , but we offer semi-annual bonuses . __eou__ Do you allow any commission ? __eou__ Yes . Commission will be given on the basis of your sales revenue . And the percentage will be 2 % of your total revenue . __eou__
Do I have to talk to the interviewer or just leave my application ? __eou__ You should communicate with the interviewer whose company you are interested in , and make a good impression on him or her . In that case , your chance of success will be greater . __eou__ What should I do in the fair ? __eou__ You should take a look at all the companies , choose your favorite ones , go over to talk with the interviewer and leave your resume in the end . __eou__
What kind of qualities should a secretary have ? __eou__ First , she needs to be hard-working .

Print shop . Seam speaking . __eou__ Hi , Sean . It ’ s Mary in Mr . Emory ’ s office . I placed an order for 1,000 bound copies of a staff manual last week . __eou__ It usually takes 2 to 3 weeks to complete a job like that . __eou__ Well , I was hoping you would do me a big favor . That was supposed to be a rush order , I forgot to tell you . I ’ m getting a lot of flak from my boss . __eou__
Would you like to have a piece of cake ? __eou__ No , thank you . I'm on a diet . __eou__ Why ? You're not fat . __eou__ I'm considering entering for the beauty contest this summer , so I must have a slender figure . __eou__ Women of all shapes would be beautiful if they are self-confident . __eou__ I'm afraid the judges do not think so . All the beauty contests are for slim girls only . __eou__ Well . There's a beauty contest in Thailand just for fat beauties . __eou__ How much do they weigh ? __eou__ All the beauties who entered the contest were over 80kg . __eou__ But I'm not fat enough to enter that contest . __eou__

I have some good news for you . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ Jenny is getting married . __eou__ Great ! Who's the bridegroom ? __eou__ Tom , that lucky guy . __eou__ The guy always hands the girls in a line . When did he propose ? __eou__ Last week , It said that he fell in love with Jenny at Mrs.Whit ' s party last Monday as soon as he saw her . __eou__ My gosh ! How romantic ! When's the big day ? __eou__ July 4 , the National Holiday . __eou__ Will it be a church wedding or a civil ceremony ? __eou__ Jenny plans to hold it in church . __eou__ Who is the best man ? __eou__ Guess ! __eou__ Nobody is OK , but you ! __eou__ You know , Tom is my best friend and he asked me to be his best man . __eou__ Did you promise him ? __eou__ Yes , I did . __eou__
what kind of music do you like listening to ? __eou__ I like music that has a fast beat and is lively , like dance music . You know , I go to a disco almost every week . Sometimes it ’ s too loud though . You prefer classical music , don ’ t you ? __eou__ yes , I do . I find it very relaxing . I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work . __eou__ I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music . It ’ s certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music . __eou__ classical music is supposed to be good for you brain . Research suggest that it makes your brain more active . Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better . __eou__ really ? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often . I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress . __eou__ yes . That ’ s why I listen to it in the evenings . I usually play it as background music while I ’ m cooking or doing other housework . __eou__ I ’ Ve got a few classical music CD ’ s . I should follow your lead and increase my brain power . __eou__ you can find plenty of recording on the internet too . You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . You should do the same with some music . You might find something you like . Classical music might make you clever , but dance might make you livelier and happier . __eou__ that ’ s true . There ’ s clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people . Music can influence a person ’ s feeling and character . __eou__
And so , I just wanted to check in with you and find out where we are with this project . As you know , you ’ Ve missed a fairly significant deadline last week , and this will negativity impact the team ’ s ability to move forward with the next stages of this project . __eou__ I know , I ’ m really sorry that I missed the deadline . But really , it wasn ’ t my fault . You see , we had all of these unexpected technical problems at the last minute , and that I couldn ’ t get into the database and extract the kind of information that I needed for the data analysis . You know , if the tech guys would have done their job and kept the ARM stable , then I wouldn ’ t have missed my deadline . __eou__ Oh , come on ! An excuse like that is tantamount to lying . You ’ re essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues , rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks . __eou__ No , I ’ m not trying to pass the buck here ; I know that it was me who is ultimately responsible for getting this done . But the thing is , I could have finished on time if the system hadn ’ t gone down . And you know , with everything I ’ Ve got going on now , I can ’ t afford to waste time dealing with technical problems . I ’ Ve got a lot on my plate and there are only twenty-four hours in a day ... __eou__ I ’ m not going to accept this excuse . You ’ re using these small technical glitches as a crutch and trying to rationalize the fact that you ’ Ve missed your deadline . Look , we have standards and I expect you to live up to those standards . No more phoney cases . If you ’ re in over your head , you tell me . No more missed deadlines . Now , I want that data on my desk by nine am ! __eou__
Do you eat a lot of fruit and vegetables in you country ? __eou__ Yes , we do . The most popular vegetables are potatoes , carrots , peas , and cauliflower . The most popular fruit are apples , bananas , pears , peaches , grapes , and oranges . Do you like vegetables ? __eou__ I like them very much . We also eat a lot of vegetables in my country , buy we eat different kinds . __eou__ Which kinds of vegetables do people in your country usually eat ? __eou__ We eat a lot of sweet corn , broccoli and eggplant . __eou__ I love eggplant ! Unfortunately , it ’ s quite expensive in my country , so I don ’ t eat it often . __eou__ Why is it relatively expensive ? __eou__ Because we don ’ t grow it much in my country . We import a lot from other countries . __eou__ I see . We grow a lot of fruit and vegetables in my country . We export a lot of melons , grapes , oranges and lemons . In your country , do you eat corn on the cob ? It's very popular in my country . __eou__ We eat it in my country too , but I wouldn't say it ’ s very popular . Most people buy frozen sweet corn from their local supermarket . __eou__ Do people usually buy frozen vegetables in your country , it ’ s very rare in mine . __eou__ A lot of younger people like to buy large packets of mixed frozen vegetables . Peas and sweet corn have been sold frozen in my country for many years . I prefer to buy fresh vegetables . __eou__
Have you read all these crazy things that are going on around the world ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed ! Then they are sold on the black market . __eou__ Don't tell me you actually believe all that ? Don't be so gullible , they are just urban legends . They are just stories people make up to scare you . __eou__ Well , I was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you play them backwards ! Can you believe that ? __eou__ You really think an artist or song writer is going to go through the trouble of putting subliminal or satanic messages in a song ? Don't be so naive ! __eou__ Well maybe you are right , but how about the story of how KFC has rows of headless chickens which are super grown in order to get bigger chickens faster ! __eou__ Sounds a bit too far fetched to be true , don't you think ? __eou__
Welcome to Adventure Tours . How may I help you ? __eou__ I want to book a tour with adventure sports . __eou__ Excellent ! Our company has more than ten years of experience in the adventure tourism and sports field . Let me show you some options . This is our most popular choice , our river guides will take you __eou__ I don ’ t really think I ’ m ready to throw myself down a river full of jagged rocks in a rubber boat or go up in the air in a wicker basket held up by an oversize balloon . What else do you have ? __eou__ Well , in that case , we can take you hang gliding with one of our experienced instructors . It ’ s the closest you can get to flying . __eou__ What ? You mean strap myself to a flimsy kite ? No , thank you ! Next ! __eou__ Mmm . OK . Well , why don ’ t you tell me a little bit more about what you would like ? We have everything from mountain biking , to rock climbing to street luge . __eou__ I ’ m thinking something exciting but safer . __eou__ I have the perfect option , this package will take you on a hiking trip through the Himalayas for three days and afterwards there ’ s a dog sledding journey ! __eou__ That ’ s more like it ! __eou__
It's your turn to go first . __eou__ I went first last time . __eou__ No , Mary went first last time . __eou__ Oh , Okay . __eou__
Jenny , you're too lazy . You should do some exercise . See , you're getting fat . __eou__ Dad , it's raining outside . __eou__ That is your excuse . __eou__ All right , all right , I will go swimming with Peter this afternoon . __eou__ Not just today . Go exercise everyday ! __eou__
May I have a cookie ? __eou__ Help yourself . __eou__
Mom , I'm ready for school . __eou__ Don't forger to come straight home after school . __eou__ I know , mom . __eou__ Have you got everything ? __eou__ Oh , my jump rope . Mom , can you get it for me ? __eou__
There are many new kinds of newspapers . I find it hard to choose among them . Which is the most popular paper circulating in our city ? __eou__ I'd recommend you the Morning Paper , it is true that the paper is a newly issued one , but its circulation is rising . Last month , it reached to three hundred thousand , which is a very good figure for a new paper . __eou__ What's the reason that people prefer to read this one ? __eou__ I think perhaps the news stories in it are truthful and accurate . It also has a special page about the stock market ; maybe this is the real reason for its popularity . Many people are now speculating in the stock market . __eou__ I can predict it will have the largest circulation in one or two years . __eou__
I think Yoga might be suitable for me . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because it doesn't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up . __eou__ But I see people sweat a lot doing Yoga too . __eou__ I don't know . I just need to try it once . I'm in urgent need of some exercise to lose some weight . __eou__ You should try swimming then . It helps you to keep fit . __eou__
What's the fare , please ? __eou__ Twenty dollars and sixty cents . __eou__ What ? You're overcharging me ! __eou__ No way . Look . That's what the meter says . __eou__ Then something must be wrong with the meter . __eou__
How about we go to the flea market today ? __eou__ Great . I have long been looking forward to there . __eou__ Me , too . There are so many cheap but nice things . __eou__ I can't help shopping there . __eou__
May I take a look at the shoes over there ? __eou__ Certainly . What's your size ? __eou__ Size 24 . Are they synthetic or leather ? __eou__ They are all leather . How do they feel ? __eou__ It's comfortable . I will take it . __eou__
I can't find proper parking space . __eou__ Let's just park here . __eou__ No , there's no parking sign . __eou__ Oh , the policeman's coming . __eou__
How big is this parking lot in our community ? __eou__ It has fifty parking spaces . __eou__ So you guys should be always busy . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ I bet it is always full of cars . __eou__ Quite the contrary , sir . Plenty of the spaces here are free when people drive their cars out to work . __eou__ Ah ... I see . __eou__ We plan to rent some of them out at the hourly rates . __eou__ What is the hourly rate for a car like this ? __eou__ I am not sure . But it'll be at least ten yuan an hour . __eou__ How mush would it cost if someone parks here for one hour and ten minutes ? __eou__ That would be twenty yuan , sir . We charge only by the number of hours , no split of each hour . __eou__ That's expensive . __eou__
Can you fix me a cup of tea , Johnny ? __eou__ Well ... uh ... how about a glass of juice instead ? __eou__ No . I'd like tea . Can you put it in my favorite cup ? You probably washed it ... __eou__ Oh , yeah . Well , uh , about your mug ... __eou__ I'll find it ... Where are all the floral pattern plates ? And dad's Yankee's mug ? __eou__

The answer is zero ! What a let-down ! __eou__ I really want to take him over my knee . __eou__ No hard feelings . After all , he is a child . __eou__ If you say so ! __eou__
Harry was angry last night . __eou__ That's because he's getting nervous . Anyway , this is the first time he's directed a play . __eou__ But he used to be very relaxed and cheerful . It's not like Harry to do a thing like that . __eou__ Yes , you're right . Maybe there's any other reason . __eou__
I have a complaint to make . The bill you sent me was incorrect . What's more , it isn't the first time __eou__ Well , I must apologize , madam . We have new computers here , you know . __eou__ Don't you think it's about time you got them working properly ? __eou__ I agree entirely . I assure you it won't happen again . __eou__
Have you followed the value of dollar lately ? __eou__ How could I help but follow it ? The fluctuation of dollar is killing my company ! The exchange rates are eating into our profits , and we can't do anything about it . __eou__ It's really frustrating , isn't it ? I have the same problem . I would feel a lot better if the currency was a little more stable . With the way the dollar plummeting lately , my securities have gone up in smoke . __eou__ Every day I have less money ! I haven't spent anything , it is just melting away because of the shifts in exchange rate . __eou__ What we really should be making investment in is the Euro . I've followed the Euro's progress over the last quarter , I think it's about time to buy in . __eou__ What about the Yen ? __eou__ Are you kidding ? The Yen is in worse shape than the Dollar ! __eou__
I'm so glad I bought this watch ! __eou__ Cool ! Flashy red lines ! __eou__ I think this is the coolest watch I've ever owned . __eou__ Is it waterproof ? __eou__ Isn't that a silly question ? You know how much of an athlete I am . __eou__ Uh , huh ... so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for ? __eou__ Well , surfing , scuba diving ... __eou__
I'll never ever work together with him ! __eou__ What happened ? Quarrel again ? __eou__ Will you take my materials back from him for me ? Please ! __eou__ Don't ask me . I don't wanna be involved in your quarrel . __eou__
I went bungee jumping yesterday . __eou__ That sounds like fun . __eou__
Rachel , do you like music ? __eou__ Of course . I can't live without it , so I always bring my CD with me no matter where I go . __eou__ What kind of music do you like best ? __eou__ Light music and classic music . __eou__ Really ? I can't believe this . I am also keen on classic music . And do you know there is a concert of classic music tomorrow evening ? __eou__ But I didn't get the ticket . And it is said that they were sold out yesterday . __eou__ I got two . We can go there together . __eou__ Amazing ! I can imagine the feeling when I hear the smooth tune around my ears . __eou__
Thanks for helping me move into my new house . __eou__ Any time . I'm just glad I could help . __eou__
Happy Thanksgiving ! __eou__ You , too . __eou__ Let's have pumpkin pie . __eou__ It's my favorite . __eou__
It's time to leave the office for the night . Firstly I log off my computer , then I set the electronic security system . __eou__ That's pretty advanced . __eou__ Now I'll quickly send a short message to my wife and take the elevator down to the basement . __eou__ Is that where you park ? __eou__ Yes , the car park is under constant video surveillance , so my car is quite safe . Please get in . __eou__ Thank you . Where is your key ? __eou__ There's no need , I have keyless entry , and the steering wheel recognizes my finger prints before starting the car . Now , we can look at the navigation system to find the best route home . __eou__ That's amazing , it even shows all the roads that are congested at the moment . __eou__ Using GPS I can rely on this to direct me home . Now I just need to find my E-Card to automatically open the gate and we can drive out . __eou__ Pretty soon cars will be driving themselves . __eou__ Maybe , but in the meantime why not help me find the remote control for my garage door ? __eou__ Here it is , and here we are . __eou__ When I turn off my home alarm , the house will automatically tum on the lights and set the climate to a comfortable level . __eou__ I have to get home , but I don't need all of this fancy technology , I think I'll just walk . __eou__
I have talked a lot about your restaurant business and your friends with my friends . One of my friends seems to be on good terms with Sue . __eou__ Is he beating Mark ’ s time ? __eou__ She is indeed well . But she would not give anyone a tumble , you bet . __eou__
I told you that she is no fool . __eou__ I know she is quite an article , but I was not sure of her ability to cope with a boss . __eou__ She cannot get in Dutch with him . He is her boss , you know . __eou__ But most bosses are fools for woman . __eou__
Ben always appears rude to the people around him . __eou__ But he's really kind at heart . __eou__ That's true . We can not judge people by appearance . __eou__
I cannot stay here any more minutes . __eou__ What is wrong with you ? __eou__ Tom is making so much noise . I have not a bit of peace and quiet all evening . __eou__ You can talk with him . __eou__
Have you met John recently ? __eou__ I saw him last week . It seems he was a bit queer in the head . __eou__ Yes , he has been like that since his accident . __eou__ What a pity ! __eou__
I heard Tom was caught stealing something again in the supermarket . __eou__ Really ? He deserves it ! They should teach him a good lesson . __eou__ But the word is his brother would go bail for him . Last time it ’ s his father who went bail for him . __eou__ Then he is really lucky . __eou__
Suit wrote me a letter . __eou__ What did she say ? __eou__ She got a master degree , and now she is going for her doctor . __eou__ Really ? I can't believe it . __eou__ It's not a surprise , is it ? She has always been a hard working student . __eou__ But I think a master degree is good enough for a girl . __eou__
What do you mean ? If he was a good programmer , he should have been raking it in . __eou__ The boss wanted to pay Bob with stock options . But Bob didn't want to play that game again . __eou__ Again ? __eou__ At his last start-up , Bob worked for stock and no salary . They folded and he made zip . __eou__ Ouch . __eou__ Now he only works freelance . Hundred bucks an hour . __eou__
What did her boss say to you ? __eou__ He asked me to beef up in the work . __eou__ Yeah . You look so unhappy recently . What ’ s the matter . __eou__ Nothing , thanks . I am just not in the mood these days . __eou__
Your tree looks beautiful . Do you decorate it this way every year ? __eou__ Yes , it's a family tradition dating back to my childhood . We use the same lights and ornaments , but of course we have a new tree each year.The children made some of these decorations . Here , you can hang this on one of those high branches . __eou__ Well , everything seems to be just about ready . Now all we need is snow.Do you exchange the presents in the morning ? __eou__ Oh , yes . The kids are too excited to wait . After we clean up the mess all the empty boxes and the wrapping paper we have a big breakfast . Then the kids have the whole day to play with their new toys . __eou__ And we'll have a great turkey dinner at around four o'clock . My brother and his family will be joining us . I look forward to meeting them . Well , it's late , so I'll say good night . I'll see you early tomorrow , so I can share your Christmas morning.Good night ! __eou__
Do you know much about computers ? __eou__ Not a great deal . __eou__ I've just been reading an article about them . They'll be used for all sorts of things now . __eou__ For accounting system and things like that , you mean ? __eou__ Yes , but they are used for other things , too . Do you remember when we went to buy a ticket for the flight to Paris . __eou__ Yes ? __eou__ The man asked where we want to go , then he type out the information on the form and waited for a reply . A few moment later , he gave us two tickets . __eou__ Of course , his machine must have been connected to a computer . __eou__ That's right . __eou__
Congratulations , Vivian . You won the grand prize , again . __eou__ Isn't it just great ! I just knew I'd win ! __eou__ You did ? How ?

I'll whisper it to you , but you have to promise not to tell anyone ! __eou__ What ? ! You did that ? ? ! ! ! __eou__
It's not good for business recently . __eou__ Not good for business ? I don't see eye to eye with you.The new policy offers new opportunities . __eou__ Too risky anyway.It ' s necessary to look before you leap . __eou__
Have you seen Harry ? __eou__ No . As far as I can remember he was supposed to be on a business trip to Lisbon . __eou__ Yes , but he was supposed to be back by now . __eou__ Maybe you'll call his home . __eou__
If the weatherman's predictions are accurate , it should rain tomorrow . __eou__ I hope not . Then we'd have to reschedule our baseball game . __eou__
Mom , can you talk about the philosophy of life with me ? __eou__ You got me on that one . __eou__

I stand on my head during my yoga routine every morning ! __eou__ Thanks for the carrot juice , Mrs . Schmidt . I've got to run to class ! __eou__ Have a good day at school ! See you tonight ! __eou__
Mark , you really did a good job . __eou__ You flatter me . __eou__ You must have spent much time on the project . __eou__ Yes .

How long have we had the A3 printer in the sales department ? __eou__ Just over a year I think . Why , what's the problem ? __eou__ I'm not sure but there seems to be something wrong with it . Is it still under guarantee ? __eou__ I think the guarantee's just run out . Let me check . Oh , it's OK . We took out an extended warranty , it runs until next March . __eou__
Good morning , sir , can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I was wondering if you had the time to show me around this exhibition ? __eou__ I'd be glad to , sir . But may I ask what line of business you are in ? __eou__ I'm in the electrical appliances . __eou__ I see . Would you be interested in seeing the audio-visual products ? They are made by our company . __eou__ Thanks , they are rather attractive . But I think there is nothing better than seeing things In actual operation . __eou__ Yes , of course . Would you like to make an inspection tour of some factories ? __eou__ Yes , very much , if it wouldn't add inconvenience to you . First hand information is always more valuable than reading pamphlets . __eou__ I'll make the arrangement and let you know the time tomorrow . __eou__ That would be great . __eou__
How can I be sure your products are of superior quality , as you promised ? __eou__ One of the reasons for our good quality products is because of our quality inspection system , which is the best of its kind . __eou__ But a quality inspection system does not mean that each unit will always be up to the standard . __eou__ We have trained analyzers to do quality analysis at the end of each part when we make the product . This means that no mistakes are made . __eou__ Your salesman also told me that each worker is trained to do quality analysis . Can you tell me a little about that ? __eou__ Certainly . We provide quality analysis training as part of the training for all new workers , plus a week of further training every year . __eou__
What is the great trait in your personality ? __eou__ I suppose my strong point is that I like developing new things and ideas . __eou__ So you may like inventive jobs . __eou__ Yes , I like inventive jobs and I am capable and responsible . __eou__
Mary , my friend recommend me for a job to work in a company , and I feel it's great . __eou__ Really ? Are you familiar with that company ? __eou__ He has introduced the company details to me . __eou__ What does the company mainly do ? __eou__ The company deals in selling electronics . __eou__ When was the company founded ? __eou__ It was founded in 2002 , has been in business for 10 years . __eou__ How many employees are there in total in the company ? __eou__ More than 2000 now . __eou__ What education background do the employees usually have ? __eou__ The company deals in selling electronics . __eou__ When was the company founded ? __eou__ It was founded in 2002 , has been in business for 10 years . __eou__ How many employees are there in total in the company ? __eou__ More than 2000 now . __eou__ What education background do the employees usually have ? __eou__ More than half of the employees have bachelors ' degree . __eou__ Are there many promotion chances in the company ? __eou__ Three times every year . __eou__ That's great .

How do you think a manager should react to an employee ’ s unsatisfactory work ? __eou__ If I were a manager , I would have a private talk with this employ to figure out the reasons . It is very important to have this one-to-one discussion in an unthreatening situation without any distraction . __eou__ Exactly , I overheard a manager scold his employee in the elevator this morning , they were from the company on the 12th floor , I guess . They were only three of us in the elevator , I felt very embarrassed to be in the middle of them . __eou__ Well , I guess the employee would feel more embarrassed and probably angry . Anyway , it is not wise at all to give a harsh time to your employee in front of others , especially strangers . __eou__ Sure , no matter what happened , they should wait to discuss in their office and find the solution in a positive way . __eou__
This is what my boss is expecting , Sandy . He wants a detailed list of expenses and equipment costs . __eou__ That ’ s going to take a while to put together , Paul . __eou__ The sooner , the better , Sandy . I don ’ t think he ’ ll sign anything till he ’ s got that in his hands . __eou__ I ’ ll get to work on it right away . Anything else ? __eou__
Hello , are you interested in this Honda ? __eou__ Hi , I am just looking . __eou__ It's a good car . __eou__ What year is it ? __eou__ 1999 . __eou__ How about the mileage ? __eou__ 6,000 miles , all highway mileage . __eou__ What do you mean 7B __eou__ Highway miles are not as bad as local miles . They do not hurt car as much . __eou__ Oh , why such a high mileage ? __eou__ The owner was commuting everyday crossing the state line . __eou__ Okay . Does this car have a warranty ? __eou__ One month . __eou__ How do I make sure I am not buying a junk ? __eou__ You'll check it out anyway you want . You can take it to a garage . __eou__ How much is it ? __eou__ $ 5,900 . __eou__ I'll have to think about it . __eou__ Leave your phone number , and I will give you a call if the price gets reduced . __eou__ Okay . __eou__
Hi , Daniel , how are you holding up ? I am greatly sorry for your loss . __eou__ Thank you , I ’ m doing much better . I ’ Ve begun organizing everything for the funeral . __eou__ How ’ s that going ? __eou__ It ’ s a lot harder than I imagined . There are many things that you have to to arrange . I booked a time and date with the funeral home , but I still have a lot of things to do . __eou__ Have you bought a burial plot and a casket ? __eou__ No . Wendy is being cremated . She always talked about how she didn ’ t want to be buried . I already chose a cremation urn and we plan to spread the ashes in the ocean . __eou__ I see , that sounds like something she would have really liked . I am sure the memorial service will be tasteful . You are doing a great job . __eou__ Thanks , it hasn ’ t been easy , but luckily we have life insurance and Wendy left behind a detailed will that will sort out any other legal matters . __eou__
This is a nice set of wheels . How much did the dealer charge you for this ? __eou__ A lot . I probably got to moonlight for the rest of my life , but so what , it ’ s worth it . Come on , get in . Let ’ s take a drive . __eou__ Okay then , let ’ s go fast ! Whoa ! This thing can really accelerate fast . __eou__ Check out what happens when I put on the brakes suddenly . It can stop quickly . __eou__ Hey , just watch out for cops or you ’ re gonna end up in the slammer . You know you tend to go fast ? __eou__ Yes , I know it . I went through my last set of tires fast . I even had three flat tires in two weeks . __eou__ Now watch ... some guys probably run a light and hit your car . __eou__ Cut out , would you ? __eou__
I tried to ask the bank teller why it changed , but she didn't speak English well enough.So I decided to go to the magazine shop . The one around the corner.And I bought an American newspaper . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ It seems that yesterday the Mexican government declared wouldn't pay back the loans it got from the World Bank.The government declared a default on the loans . __eou__ That's serious . __eou__ I know . The economy here is having serious problems.But because the government declared a default , the currency value went way down . __eou__ So now Mexican pesos are worth about half as much . __eou__ Yes , it's an amazing drop . __eou__ Wow . I feel sorry for the Mexicans . But it's good for us . __eou__ Yes , it's very good . We suddenly have twice as much money to spend here.Our hotel is now half as expensive as when we got here ! Isn't that strange ? __eou__ Yes , and you know what ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ I don't really like this hotel that much.So tonight , now that we are so rich , tonight why don't we stay in the most expensive hotel in town ? __eou__ Why not ? We should do it . Because now we can afford it . __eou__
Hey , Daniel , how's it going ? __eou__ Hey , Daddy , today I had really a fantastic history class . __eou__ Wow , it's so strange for you to say things like that . What had happened ? __eou__ We've learnt the story of Zheg He Sailing to West Ocean . He is a real great navigator . __eou__ Did your teacher tell you the route he took ? __eou__ Yeah , he , with his fleet , came across the Indian Ocean , and arrived at the east coast of Africa . __eou__ Great , do you still remember when he started his voyage ? __eou__ Of course , that is from 1405 to 1433 , which is in Ming dynasty . __eou__ Good , by the way , do you finish reading the book Robinson Crusoe I've bought for you ? __eou__ Not yet , you know I have a lot of homework to do . __eou__ You should speed up , because the story of Robinson can give you a better understanding about what you learned today . __eou__ OK , great Daddy , after supper , I'll embark on it . __eou__ That's my boy ! Wait , Daniel , when is Pirates of the Caribbean on ? __eou__ Is it about Captain Jack Sparrow , who wants to find the treasure on the sea ? __eou__ Exactly , now , tell me the time . __eou__ I won't tell you , unless you promise to let me watch it with you . __eou__
Hi , Michelle . Do you need to use the photocopier ? __eou__ Oh , hi Jeremy . No please , go ahead . So how are you , Jeremy ?

I heard a rumor this morning ... It seems Trusten Tools is going out of business.Another competitor is going bankrupt.That could be good news for us . __eou__ I think you must have heard wrong.The truth is we are going to be taken over by Trusten.We are being bought out , and our company will be merging with our largest competitor.It ' s not good news at all ... __eou__ What ? We are merging with Trusten ? I never thought that would happen.Will we be getting new owners ? Will it affect our jobs ? __eou__ Probably.The new owners will be coming to start alignment meetings nextweek.One of the big question is what to call the new conglomerate company . __eou__ Wow , with such a big change.We won't have the same name ? __eou__ It's not only the name of our company that will change ... I expect that after this acquisition , there'll be a ton of things up in the air . __eou__
Sir , I've finished your shaving . Wow , it takes years off you after having a shave . __eou__ Really ? You've done a good job . __eou__ Thank you . May I suggest you to trim your eyebrows ? __eou__ I have never heard that men would trim their eyebrows . Are you kidding ? __eou__ No , sir , I am serious . Haven't you heard that today men are becoming increasingly interested in having their eyebrows professionally groomed ? __eou__ Do you mean that it is a trend for men to trim their eyebrows ? __eou__ Absolutely . Several men have tried it in my A shop . Do you want to try ? __eou__ Yeah , let me have a try . __eou__
Food is less expensive in a cafeteria , because you serve yourself . __eou__ How to do it ? __eou__ Just pick up a tray , then put a knife , a fork , a spoon and a paper napkin on it and stand in the line . __eou__ How long will it take to reach the buffet ? __eou__ Not long , because people rush for lunch . __eou__ The line sure does move fast . __eou__ Tell the man behind the counter what you want . __eou__ OK . I like that green vegetable but I don't know how to call it . __eou__ Just point to it if you don't know the name . __eou__ All right . __eou__
Oh , you can rest assured that they'll be no problem . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ Your upstairs neighbors live in Canada and rarely come back to Taiwan . When they do , they're never home . __eou__ And the downstairs neighbors ? __eou__ Two flight attendants that are also in and out of town . When they're here , they're usually sleeping . And next door to you is me . I'm a quiet neighbor . __eou__ Sounds ideal . We'll get back to you in a couple of days then . __eou__
It's my first visit to Prague , I'll be here for three days for a conference , then I have a day on my own to do some sightseeing before I head back home . What do you suggest I see when I'm here ? __eou__ There are many interesting places you should be sure to see . One problem is transportation , however . Because the city is very old , the roads are narrow and congested . If you only have three or four days to visit , you don't want to spend them waiting in traffic in a cab . I suggest you take the subway . __eou__ The subway ? But is there a subway station next to my hotel ? I have to go between the conference center and the hotel several times a day ... __eou__ No worries , there's a subway station at the conference center itself , and a shuttle from your hotel to the conference center that takes only 5 minutes . When you do your personal sightseeing , you can first take the shuttle to the conference center , then hop on the metro . __eou__ Is it expensive to ride on the underground ? __eou__ You can get a daily pass that will allow you to travel unlimited for the whole day for about 6 dollars . Otherwise , you can pay by trip , which is about 50 cents to 2 dollars each trip , depending on how far you go . __eou__ Is it easy to get lost ? __eou__ No , no ... . it's very hard to get lost . There are two lines , one that goes in a circle , the other that is straight . If you get lost , there are always subway attendants that can help you find your way . __eou__
David , what do you want to do after graduation ? __eou__ I suppose I should choose one from the ' Best Career List ' , to be a public officer , what do you think ? __eou__ That sounds like a hot job , right ? But in my opinion , you ought not to choose one career from that so-called list , and you need to take your interests , values , and skills into account . __eou__ It beats me ! I never thought about it before and maybe I thought finding a career is a simple thing . __eou__ You'd better ask for suggestions from a career counselor , and then make a decision . __eou__
