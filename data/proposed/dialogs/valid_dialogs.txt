Can I come around now ? __eou__ I ’ d rather you didn ’ t come immediately as I said I ’ m very busy at the moment . Come after lunch , Mark . __eou__
Ma , I really don't know how to thank you . __eou__ I'm glad I was able to help . __eou__ It's most kind of you . __eou__ Don't mention it .

I guess I can ask around to see if anyone's got a room or apartment available . __eou__ thank you . I think I should also have a look at the Internet to see if anyone's got a sublet . __eou__ how much do are you looking to spend ? __eou__ I can only afford about 1,000 yuan a month . __eou__ looks like you'll have to get a place in the suburbs . __eou__ it doesn't matter , but it needs to be close to the subway or on a convenient bus route . __eou__ anything you need to have in the place ? __eou__ I want a bedroom with full bath , and it'll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side . __eou__ you can also check out university bulletin boards . __eou__ why ? Will those be students who are leaving ? __eou__ not really , but landlords put up notices to attract students and they often have low rent . __eou__ thank you . I'll be sure to take a look . __eou__ good luck . __eou__

Hi , Sam . I want to buy a pet . Do you have any ideas ? __eou__ You really should go to Rachel's pet store . __eou__ why ? anything special there ? __eou__ it's more than special . You can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more . __eou__ Oh , really ? are there any snakes ? __eou__ snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets . __eou__ that's terrific . I can't wait to check it out . __eou__ Hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ? __eou__ why not ? it's so cool . __eou__ but it will pose a risk to your health . __eou__ pardon ? __eou__ i mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria . they are likely to cause immune system problems . __eou__ well , I didn't realize that . __eou__ I don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children . __eou__ oh , I should have thought of my brother's baby girl . Maybe I'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet . __eou__ yes , good luck , Maria . __eou__

Welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you today ? __eou__ Hello . I called earlier in the week and spoke to someone in the personal loans department about an overseas study loan . She said to come in as soon as I had the chance , as this must be done in person . I'd like to apply today . __eou__ OK , that's absolutely fine . I will need to see some credentials before we can get started . Do you have the notification of admission letter from your university , your passport and your visa with you ? __eou__ Yes , yes . It's all here . There you go . I'm not sure if I need any other proof or guarantee to get this loan , do I ? __eou__ You do , I'm afraid . There are 3 ways to do this . You can choose , mortgage , pledge or guarantee mode . __eou__ Yes , I read about all of these in the brochure and decided which would be more suitable for me . I'd like to go for the guarantee mode , please . __eou__ Right , that's no problem . I see you are already well informed . If you choose that one , you can borrow up to 70 % of the total tuition and miscellaneous fees . __eou__ OK , that's perfect , 70 % is excellent , it'll be a big help . Thanks . __eou__
You know , I really don ’ t think Americans are very romantic . __eou__ Where did you get that idea ? __eou__ That ’ s the impression I get from the movies , and from looking around . Men and women seem very business-like in their relations with each other . __eou__ Well , I ’ m still not sure what you ’ re asking me . __eou__ Is it true or isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Do you want to know something about the American character ? __eou__ I just think you ’ re trying to change the subject . But go ahead . __eou__ No , this will help answer your question . In American society boys and girls are raised together . They ’ re not segregated in their activities ! Boys and girls go out together from an early age . __eou__ OK , go on . __eou__ After being raised together , men and women can be business-like in each other ’ s company . It really doesn ’ t have anything to do with the way a man and woman behave toward each other when they are in love . Does that answer your question ? __eou__ Not exactly , but I see your point . __eou__ I think Americans are pretty romantic when they are in a relationship and a lot of flirting goes on in every office . After you ’ Ve been in America for a while , you will probably see what I mean . __eou__
What time is it by your watch ? __eou__ I'm sorry , my watch has stopped . __eou__ It's 2:42 by my watch . But it moves a bit fast . __eou__ Let's ask someone else . __eou__

We eat Chinese food only at the Chinese restaurant . __eou__ My mother can make some Chinese food . __eou__ Really ? That's wonderful ! __eou__

What happened to that girl you were seeing ? __eou__ Oh Jackie ? We broke up last week . __eou__ That was a short relationship . You only started dating 2 months ago . __eou__ It was actually a long two months . She was a psycho . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ She would be laughing one moment , and if I said something insensitive , she would start crying . I didn't want to deal with that . __eou__ She sounds very emotional . __eou__ She was a psycho , man . One time we were suppose to get together . I was waiting for her call , and when she finally called , she was screaming why I wasn't at her place . __eou__ Were you suppose to be there ? __eou__ I thought she was going to call when she was done shopping . It was a misunderstanding . She was literally screaming on the phone over this . __eou__ Ok . You're right . She's a psycho . __eou__ I'm just glad it's over . __eou__
Hi , boss . You have a call . __eou__ I told you to hold my calls . I ’ m very busy at the moment . __eou__ I know . But she said she had an important thing to tell you . __eou__ Okay . Put her through . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__

What are you doing there with your mobile phone ? __eou__ I'm moblogging ! __eou__ Moblogging ? what does that mean ? __eou__ Oh , moblogging is a combination of the word ' mobile ' and ' blogging ' . It's another form of blogging . Users can publish blog entries to the web from a mobile phone or other mobile devices . __eou__ Sounds interesting ! That must be very convenient . __eou__ Yes , you're right . I can blog wherever and whenever I'm on the move . It's especially good when I'm on a business trip and my laptop happens to be away from me . __eou__ How can you do that ? __eou__ Well , if I simply want to write a few words , I'll send it by email or edit it all from the cell phone browser . __eou__ What if you want to publish some photos ? __eou__ Then I'll shoot some pictures , re-size the images and upload them with text descriptions to my blog . __eou__ I see . Moblogging must have done a great favor for habitual bloggers like you . __eou__ You bet it ! __eou__
What are we going to do ? I can't get the car out of this ditch . I'm stuck ! __eou__ I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour . __eou__ I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling ! __eou__ I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ? __eou__ I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go . __eou__ Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ? __eou__ I don't know . __eou__ I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm . __eou__ I have plenty of gas . __eou__ Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze . __eou__ So what can we do ? __eou__ Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible . __eou__ Alright . That's a good idea . __eou__ I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days . __eou__ Days ? __eou__ Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days . __eou__ Oh , my God ! It's good we have food . __eou__ Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again . __eou__ Okay , I'll follow your advice . __eou__
I fired Mr . Li today . __eou__ That's terrible . __eou__

Well , what about this two-bedroom apartment ? The listing says it's right in the heart of the city , just steps from the metro . __eou__ Wow , that would be very convenient . How much is the rent ? __eou__ It says it's $ 1600 . But if you share it with another person , that's only $ 800 per month . __eou__ That definitely sounds like a steal . I think that is a very trendy neighborhood as well . __eou__ That's true . I know that there are lots of popular restaurants and coffee shops around there . __eou__
Good afternoon . Is there a vacant room here ? __eou__ What do you want , a single or a double one ? __eou__ A single , preferably with a bath . __eou__ How long do you intend to stay ? __eou__ For four days or so . __eou__ We have one single room on the fifth floor . __eou__ I hope it's quiet .

Here you are . __eou__ Your room number is 505 . This is your key . The bellboy will help you with the baggage . __eou__

What ’ s up ? You don ’ t look too good . __eou__ Yeah , my head hurts , that ’ s all . I ’ Ve been in physics class all day . It ’ s killer ! __eou__ I liked physics . It ’ s all math , really , arcs , curves , velocity , cool stuff . __eou__ Yeah , yeah , but today ’ s lesson was all about the creation of the universe . __eou__ A physics class about the creation of the universe ? That ’ s some pretty unscientific language there . Sounds more religious to me . __eou__ It ’ s all religion . Take the theory of the Big Bang.How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion ? That ’ s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff . __eou__ Turtles ? Whatever ... Look , all that ’ s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles . At least , that ’ s what the math says . __eou__ Math , sheath . What ’ s the evidence ? __eou__ There is evidence ! You know Edwin Hubble ? He ’ s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe , thus advancing notions of an expanding universe . What would it be expanding from ? Well , the Big Bang ... DUH ! __eou__ Anyway , it ’ s just a theory . Why do people go around touting theories ? Where ’ s the scientific rigor in that ? __eou__ Dude , don ’ t equivocate . A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing . You slept through class , didn ’ t you ? __eou__
Please pull your table down . It's lunch hour . __eou__ All right . __eou__ What would you like , sir ? __eou__ What would you suggest ? __eou__ You may choose from the fish and beef . __eou__ I'd like the beef . __eou__ Here you are . Would you like a cup of tea or coffee ? __eou__ No , I'd rather have a glass of juice , please . What kinds do you have ? __eou__ We have a selection of orange , apple , grape and lemonade . __eou__ I'll have a glass of lemonade . More ice , please . __eou__ All right . Will there be anything else ? __eou__ Could you give me more paper napkins ? __eou__ Sure . Here you are . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ You're welcome . Enjoy your meal . Press the call button if you need any more help . __eou__
Did you clean your room today ? __eou__ No , not yet . __eou__ Well , when were you planning on doing that ? __eou__ I'm going to clean it up later . __eou__ Didn't I ask you to clean it up earlier ? __eou__ I'm going to clean it . __eou__ I want you to vacuum in your room , and don't forget to dust everything . __eou__ I know . I'll do it . __eou__ Make sure you clean it up before you do anything else . __eou__ I'm not going anywhere until later , so I'll clean it then . __eou__
Well , humans could never make something like that . __eou__ Those poor Egyptians slaves worked so hard and you want to give aliens all the credit ! __eou__ Be a little more open-minded , Stu ! Don't believe everything you read in your history books ! __eou__ OK , but don't believe everything you see on The X-files , either ! __eou__ Speaking of The X-files , it's on right now ! __eou__

How about the matter ? __eou__ I heard it has been finally settled under the rose . __eou__ It ’ s the only way to preserve her reputation . __eou__ Yeah , fortunately it did not cause a disaster . __eou__
I hear many people here speak French . __eou__ It is because Montreal is a bilingual city . __eou__ It is not easy to improve my English . __eou__ But it's a good opportunity to learn French . __eou__ Yeah ! But French is not easy to learn . __eou__ Take it easy . I have the confidence to learn it well . __eou__

I am too tired to move a step further . __eou__ What about taking the cable car ? __eou__ Attaboy , that's just what I am thinking . __eou__ Wow , What a long queue this is ! __eou__ Honey , be patient . It's better to wait than to climb with my legs broken . __eou__ Daddy , look ahead in the distance , the mountains there . They roll all the way up to the sky . __eou__ Yeah , the scenery is beautiful . What's more , the air is fresh here ? __eou__ So you wanna stay here ? __eou__ Of course not , I have to watch my American Idol . __eou__
What would you like to drink ? __eou__ I feel like a cup of black tea . __eou__ Wouldn't you like something to eat ? __eou__ Yes , I'd like a portion of that strawberry tart . __eou__ Right . I'll see if I can catch the waitress's eye . __eou__
I'm planning to buy a bicycle . As you are quite a cycling enthusiast , I wish you might give me some advice . __eou__ With pleasure , chap . But before I start , I need to know what you want a bike for ? __eou__ My purposes are two-fold . On the one hand , I've grown bored of commuting on suffocating buses every day and decided to ride to work . On the other hand , bicycling is a sport , and I intend to build up my body through constantly taking a ride over the weekends . __eou__ Cycling during weekends ? Do you me riding on the mountainous countryside just the neighboring towns ? __eou__ Does that make any difference ? __eou__ Can't be greater . If you ride on bumpy , hilly roads , a mountain bike is what you need . But if you just ride comfortably along the city lanes , you might choose a road bike . __eou__ Are they designed differently ? __eou__ A road bike features skinny tires and a light-weight frame . Its riding position puts you bent over the handlebars . It's not particularly beefy in construction , and generally , it won't stand up well under heavy loads or on really rough surfaces . In contrast , mountain bikes have wide tires and a stout frame . You sit higher on them and don't have to hunched over . __eou__
Do you have a park in the city ? __eou__ Yes , there is a lake in the park . It is very beautiful . __eou__ That ’ s great . We can go boating on the lake in the afternoon . __eou__ It ’ s a good idea . But I am afraid it ’ s too cold . It is very windy on the lake . __eou__ Then we can take a walk and enjoy the scenery in the park . __eou__
Tomorrow I'll take you to some places that I'm sure you will have interest in . __eou__ Where else haven't we been to yet ? __eou__ They are the Folk Antique Handicrafts and Collectibles Exhibition Halls . __eou__ Sounds great ! How many kinds of folk collections do they have ? __eou__ Well . there're actually over 200 kinds of folk collections in this city . That's half the collections of antique objects in China . There's one exhibition half for multiple collection , and several individual display rooms for private collectors . __eou__ Private collectors ! They must have excellent collections . I'II go and see each of them . What kinds of collections can I see ? Come on , don't keep me in suspense ! __eou__ No hurry ! I'II tell you now , The collections include ancient cases and caskets , tea sets , abacuses , precious sea shells and conches , drama costumes , agates , ancient coins , fans , mini-musical instruments , root-carving , rare stones and rocks , model ships , model cars ... __eou__ Enough ! I can't wait anymore . __eou__
Kate , can we change the channel ? __eou__ Why ? __eou__ This channel has so many advertisements , and it doesn't have any good TV programs . __eou__ OK . You can change it . __eou__ What about this one ? Do you like this program ? __eou__ No , I think it is very boring . Can you change it to Channel Twelve , please ? __eou__ Yes . Oh , it's a talk show . __eou__ Yeah , it's very funny . Have you ever watched it before ? __eou__ No , I haven't . This is my first time to watch it . __eou__ I'm sure you will like it . __eou__
How long have we had the A3 printer in the sales department ? __eou__ Just over a year I think . Why , what's the problem ? __eou__ I'm not sure but there seems to be something wrong with it . Is it still under guarantee ? __eou__ I think the guarantee's just run out . Let me check . Oh , it's OK . We took out an extended warranty , it runs until next March . __eou__
Well , Mr . Cui , could you tell me why you are interested in working with this company ? __eou__ I think working in this company could give me the best chance to use what I have learnt . As you know , I majored in computer programming in the university . I've cherished a desire to get a job where I can apply my knowledge . I know your company is one of the largest computer companies in the world , and I wish to have opportunity to develop my capabilities here . That ’ s why I applied . __eou__ I see . But have you ever done any work in this field ? __eou__ Yes , since 1993 , I ’ Ve been employed as a clerk in the Beijing Branch of the DHAK Trading Corporation . __eou__ Why do you plan to change your job ? __eou__ Because I would like to get a job in which I can have good opportunity for advancement , and the job was not challenging enough . __eou__ Have you applied for work with any other companies ? __eou__ Yes , I applied with another company , but that was just to get experience in being interviewed . __eou__ If you are accepted at both places , which company will you choose ? __eou__ This one , of course . Your company is my first choice . I want to work for you . __eou__
Why did she do that ? __eou__ I have no idea . It was completely out of the blue . __eou__
Mr . Black ? I'm from the Pacific Mechanical Company . __eou__ Oh , yes . Step inside , will you ? I'll give you an idea of what business I want to take up with you . Take a seat . We can go into details later . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Our speciality back in South Africa is wholesale supplying of screws , bolts , nuts , pins , studs , and that kind of things . __eou__ For wood or for metal ? __eou__ For both . Now , do you make machines for producing such things ? __eou__ Yes , we have a showroom not far away from here , Mr . Black . Are you free now ? __eou__ Yes , quite free until noon . __eou__ Fine . Then , shall we go right away ? I have a car outside . __eou__ Have you ? That's splendid . Just let me get my things together . I won't keep you long . __eou__ Take your time , sir . I can wait . __eou__
hi . Could you give me a hand with this report ? __eou__ sure . I ’ d be happy to give you some hints and advice . __eou__ thanks . Would you mind taking a look at the layout ? Do you think it ’ s appropriate ? I want it to be formal , but not boring to look at . __eou__ it looks good to me . I would suggest that you put the client ’ s logo and our logo on each page . The bosses seem to like that . __eou__ that ’ s an excellent suggestion . I can easily do it on the computer . __eou__ why don ’ t you use a different font the headings ? They ’ ll be more distinct . __eou__ I ’ ll take that suggestion too . How about the content ? __eou__ I think you ’ Ve included all the essential things . You might want to make the conclusion a little longer . Restate your reasons clearly . __eou__ is it ok to include the pictures ? __eou__ definitely ! I would include one or two on each page if possible . Remember that you should make the report as eye-catching as possible . __eou__ thanks for those ideas . I ’ ll get to work on them right away . __eou__
Good morning , Passport , please . __eou__ Here you are . __eou__ Ah , thank you.Please bring your luggage here for inspection . __eou__ Ok.But is there anything wrong ? __eou__ It's just a regular inspection.Do you have anything to declare ? __eou__ I've got 6 packets of cigarettes and 2 bottles of champagne.Besides , I have two cameras , one is for my own use , and the other is a gift . __eou__ Well , the cigarettes and the champagne are not in excess of the duty-free allowance . But according to our law , each passenger is allowed only one camera duty-free.You ' ll have to pay duty for the other one . __eou__ Ok . Where shall I pay duty for it ? __eou__ Please wait a minute . I'll make out the duty memo ... Here you are.Take this and pay to the woman over there . __eou__ I've paid for it . Here's the receipt . __eou__ Very well . I hope you ' ll enjoy your stay in America . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Hey John . I have some great news . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ I got a job offer from Dell . __eou__ That's great . I thought you said you didn't get the job . __eou__ I thought I did bad on the interview , but I guess I was wrong . I'm so happy right now . __eou__ I bet . That's great news . I'm very happy for you . __eou__ Thanks . I feel like celebrating . Let's go have a beer . It's on me . __eou__ Sounds good . __eou__
Hi , Yang Tang . Come in ! Pretty hot out there , isn't it ? Did you have trouble finding us ? Sit ! Sit ! __eou__ Hello , Mr . Jones , its ... __eou__ Yang Tang , just call me Fred ! Everyone does . __eou__ Ei , OK , er .. Fred . Thank you for seeing me today . __eou__ No problem . No problem at all . Say , it says here in your resume you studied in California . Great place , isn ’ t it ? I studied in California myself . I really enjoyed it . What did you like most about California ? __eou__ Well , I ... I guess the weather . And the people . They were all very friendly to me . __eou__ Yeah , the people are quite relaxed ... Those were some great times I spent there . Well , thanks for stopping by . Are you from King Dao , Yang Tang ? __eou__ Yes , I am . I was born here , and still live with my parents in the same house . __eou__ Is that right ? Wonderful , wonderful . I've been in King Dao for two years now . A great place . Nice people and great beer ! Well , I guess we ’ d better get started . __eou__
We've been cramming for tomorrow's history exam since early this morning . What do you say we take a break and listen to some music , okay ? __eou__ Now that you mention it , I'm getting a little bumed-out from studying nonstop , too . Listening to some music for a while would suit me just fine . __eou__ While you're picking out a record to play , I'll grab a couple of beers out of the refrigerator . __eou__ You sure have a lot of discs here . __eou__ Yeah , I've got everything from rock n ' roll to the latest new - wave stuff . __eou__ To tell you the truth , I'm strictly into classical music . You don't happen to have any Bach or Mozart , do you ? __eou__ Sorry , my taste in music doesn't go back any further than the 1960 ' s . Music written before then is just history to me . __eou__ Well , speaking of history , let's get back to the books.We ' Ve got an exam tomorrow , remember ? __eou__
Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes . I am a bit confused . My sociology class is supposed to read a chapter in a book called Sociology and the Modern Age . According to the syllabus , the book is in the library , but I haven't been able to find it . __eou__ Do you have your syllabus with you ? May I see it ? __eou__ Yes , uh ... I put it in the front of my sociology notebook . Oh , here it is . __eou__ Let me see . Oh yes . Your professor has placed this book on reserve . That means you cannot find it on the shelves in its usual place . You need to go to a special room called the reserve room . It's down the hall and to the right . __eou__ I'm sorry - I still don't understand . __eou__ You see , your professor wants every one in the class to read the chapter . If one student removes the book from the library , it is likely that none of the other students will have the opportunity to read it . So , your professor has insured that all students have the opportunity to read it by placing it on reserve . __eou__ So , will I be able to find this book ? __eou__ Yes , when a book is on reserve , a student can go to the reserve room and ask the reserve librarian for the book . The student can have the book for a few hours , and he or she MUST read it in the library during that time . That way , the book stays in the library , and all students have a chance to read it . __eou__ Okay . Thank you . I understand now . __eou__ Will there be anything else ? __eou__ No ! I am on my way to the reserve room . Thanks again ! __eou__
Look , my clothes are wet . __eou__ Mine are wet , too . __eou__ Unexpectedly , a girl threw a bucket of water on me . __eou__ She wished good luck to you . __eou__ The Dai people are enthusiastic . __eou__ Yes . __eou__
How are you doing with your English Language studies ? __eou__ I think I'm making good progress . __eou__ Is it harder than you thought ? __eou__ At first it was , but now I've got the basics.It ' s fun . __eou__
Oh hi , Linda , this is Todd . __eou__ Yes , Todd , how nice to hear your voice ! __eou__ Linda , I just wanted to say that I had a wonderful evening with you last Friday . __eou__ I really enjoyed our evening together , Todd . __eou__ I had fun also and was wondering if you would like to go hiking with me in the mountains on Saturday . __eou__ Hiking would be perfect ! May I bring along a picnic lunch for us to share ? __eou__ A picnic lunch would be a nice thing to have along . __eou__ I'll work on the lunch , and you can work out the details of where we will go . What time will you be at my house ? __eou__ Nine would be good , don't you think ? __eou__ Nine is good . See you on Saturday ! __eou__
How's it going ? __eou__ I'm in a good mood today , actually . How about you ? __eou__ To be honest , I'm a bit fed up . __eou__ What's wrong ? __eou__ There's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around . __eou__ I see ! Do you want to ask her out ? __eou__ Sure , but how ? __eou__ You can ask her out for drink after work . __eou__ But for what reasons ? She doesn't even know who I am . __eou__ Then you've got a lot of homework to do . You need to get her notice first . __eou__ Easier said than done . __eou__ You can start by meeting her at the bus stop and saying hello to her . __eou__ But I always get tongue-tied when I see her . __eou__ That's something you need to overcome . Men should make the first move as most of girls prefer being chased . __eou__ I see . I'll try . __eou__ Good luck . __eou__
Good morning , Madam . Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ Ve come to inquire about a 6,000- dollar remittance from California . Has it arrived ? __eou__ May I have your name , please ? __eou__ My name is Jenny Clinton . __eou__ I see . Wait for a moment please . I am sorry , Mrs . Clinton , but the remittance doesn't appear to have arrived yet . __eou__ Really ? It should have arrived . It was sent a week ago . __eou__ If the money was sent by cable , it would have taken about one or two days . But if it was sent by airmail , it would take at least one week . __eou__ Well , then I'll come again the day after tomorrow . __eou__ Or would you like us to phone you when the money arrives ? __eou__ That would be very kind of you . __eou__ Could you please tell me your phone number , so we'll give you a ring as soon as the remittance has arrived ? __eou__ The phone number is 328 6765 extension 105 . __eou__ Thank you . We'll inform you in time . Goodbye . __eou__
I would like to make a reservation for tomorrow . __eou__ I'm sorry but we are fully booked . __eou__ Well , how about 4th ? __eou__ That's fine , but we have only a single room , is that OK ? __eou__ Yes . Please help me reserve it . __eou__
I am sorry for damaging your car , sir . __eou__ Don't worry about it . Just leave it to the insurance companies . __eou__ The car park in this community is over crowded , isn't it ? __eou__ Yeah , more and more cars . People should try to take public transportation . __eou__ There aren't enough buses in this city , are there ? __eou__ Yeah , sometimes I really feel like writing a letter to the mayor . __eou__ That's too much of hassle . We just want a little bigger parking space . __eou__ Have you taken this to the property management , yet ? __eou__ No . but I'm gonna . You know , several months ago , I backed into red Honda when parking . __eou__ Where ? On the road ? __eou__ No , right here in the parking lot . It was parked right here in your space . The left rearview mirror was smashed . __eou__ Is the car owner a lady with deafening voice ? __eou__ Yes ! How do you know that ? __eou__ That's my wife ! __eou__
What's the weather today ? __eou__ It's fine today . __eou__ What was the weather like yesterday ? __eou__ It rained all day yesterday . The weather was awful last week . __eou__ What will the weather be like tomorrow ? __eou__ It's going to be sunny tomorrow . __eou__
Could you show me where the ice cream is located ? __eou__ Just go to the end of the store . And it will be on your right . We have all the ice creams and frozen foods back there in the freezers . __eou__ This is my first time here . __eou__ Please notice all of our aisles are numbered and classified by signs on the ceiling . That might help you . __eou__ I'm glad I asked you . So this is aisle 6 where I can find all the canned fruits and vegetables . __eou__ That ’ s correct . __eou__
Today , you need to pay 20 RIB in handling fees . __eou__ Can't you just take it from my account ? I can't be bothered with cash dealings today . __eou__ I must tell you that because your banking has been such a large amount , you need to wait until you leave the country to get any currency back . __eou__ You mean , if there is any left over ? __eou__ Yes , totally . It's nice to meet a customer who understands the system . __eou__ Right , so the deposit , if I don't draw on it will be blocked after you get the Deposit Certification ? __eou__ That's right . I know we have a complex system , but you have caught on so quickly . __eou__
First of all , I would like to thank you for your kind invitation to visit your beautiful country . I hope my visit will help to promote a friendly relationship between us . __eou__ We've been looking forward to your visit . It is a great pleasure for us to have you as our guest . It is always more convenient to discuss things face to face . __eou__ I would like to tell you that my clients are very satisfied with the last delivery of your slippers . The styles and colors are very much to the taste of our market . __eou__ We've received some similar comments from other Australian firms too . __eou__ I understand you are selling the same products to some other Australian importers . This tends to complicate my business . As you know , I am experienced in the business of slippers and enjoy a good business relationship with all the leading whole - sabers and retailers in that line . I have a mind to expand this business in the years to come . One of the reasons of my visit here is to sign a sole agency agreement with you on these items for a period of 3 years . As it is to our mutual interests and profit , I am sure you'll have no objection to it . __eou__ We appreciate your good intention and your effort in pushing the sale of our slippers . As you know , the demand for this item in your market is quite substantial . However , according to our records , the total amount of your order last year was moderate , which does not warrant an agency appointment . Unless you increase the turnover we can hardly appoint you our sole agent . __eou__ I'll come to that . My proposal is __eou__ As far as I remember , we sold about 40,000 pairs last year to you alone . Don't you think this annual turnover is rather conserve - time for a sole agent ? __eou__ Well , I admit I always do business on the safe side . Could you let me have your proposal then ? __eou__ Let's put it this way . I propose a sole agency agreement for Ladies and gents plastic slippers ( excluding children's ) for a duration of 3 years ; 60,000 pairs to be sold in the first year , 70,000 pairs in the second year , and 80,000 pairs in the third year , the area is to be within the continent of Australia ( excluding any neighboring island ) , commission 5 % . __eou__ You certainly drive a hard bargain , Mrs . Brown . __eou__ On the contrary , Mr . London , we value your friendship more than anything else . We both understand our slippers are very popular in your market on account of their superior quality and compete - time price . And with the sole agency in your hand , there will be no competition and you can easily control the market , which would naturally result in bigger sales . I'm sure you can fulfill the agreement without much difficulty . __eou__ Well , if you put it this way , I'll have to comply . When shall we sign the contract , Mrs . Brown ? __eou__ Tomorrow afternoon . __eou__ Tomorrow afternoon will be fine . __eou__
OK . Everything is in the bag . __eou__ Excellent ! Let ’ s set off . __eou__
Excuse me , what do you want for this bag ? __eou__ Let me see . The one goes for $ 17 . __eou__ Would you take $ 12 ? __eou__ No , I can ’ t let you have it for 12.How about 14 ? __eou__ 13.50 ? __eou__ Sorry , $ 14 is the lowest I can go . __eou__
Is this your new teacher ? __eou__ Yes , it is . __eou__ Is she short ? __eou__ No , she ’ s average . __eou__ What color are her eyes ? __eou__ They ’ re dark gray . __eou__ What color is her hair ? __eou__ It ’ s blond . __eou__ And how old is she ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . __eou__
Let me get last week's notes . __eou__ Yeah , sure , you didn't come to class that day ? __eou__ I couldn't come . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ I wasn't feeling well . __eou__ Here they are . __eou__ Thanks a lot ; are these all the notes ? __eou__ Oh , no , this is the rest . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ It's no problem at all . __eou__
Let me help you with that . __eou__ Thanks very much . __eou__ You really shouldn't be lifting this by yourself . __eou__ I know , but there was nobody else . __eou__
I don't have my homework today . __eou__ You usually are good about turning it in ; what happened ? __eou__ I was really sick . __eou__ But couldn't you have done it when you felt better ? __eou__ Yes , I probably could . __eou__ You have already missed one other assignment ; when can I expect the make-ups ? __eou__ Next class meeting . __eou__ That will be soon enough , but make sure you get next week's assignment in as well , all right ? __eou__ That would work for me . __eou__ Good . I know that you are capable of being an excellent student . __eou__
After you __eou__ Thank you ! __eou__ What's the weather like in your country ? I suppose it must be warmer than here . __eou__ Oh , yes . We have rather mild winters . It always has much sunshine in winter . But it was very foggy when I left two days ago . I knew it would be colder here , but I thought there would be a lot of snow . __eou__ We don't have much snow in winter in Beijing . In fact , we haven't had any so far this winter . The winter is rather long , but the cold is generally not severe . The temperature seldom gets as low as ten below zero Centigrade . __eou__ What is the temperature today , do you know ? __eou__ About freezing point , I think.But the morning's forecast said that we are going to have a very cold spell in the next few days - and the temperature will probably drop to 10 or 15 degrees below zero . __eou__ Oh , I'm very lucky that my wife let me take a heavy overcoat . __eou__ It is considerate of your wife . __eou__ Yes , she is . By the way , what is the best season in Beijing ? __eou__ Fall is the best season in Beijing . It's neither hot nor cold . The sky is clear and blue . There's hardly any wind , only a slight breeze which is hardly noticeable . And we have plenty of sunshine too . __eou__ Really ? Then I will come to Beijing in the fall next time . __eou__ Good , you are welcome . __eou__
Is there anything wrong ? __eou__ I ’ m worried about my daughter . She can ’ t decide about college . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . That ’ s just a part of being a teenager . __eou__ I don ’ t mind that . But she disagrees with me about everything . __eou__ You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ’ t affect her decision . __eou__ But I just want to give her some tips . __eou__ Oh , she can make her own decisions . __eou__ I guess you are right . __eou__ Believe me . Everything will be ok . __eou__ I hope so . __eou__
Is Tom available please ? __eou__ He's on the other line , can you hold for a minute ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ He'll be right with you . __eou__
Happy Birthday ! This is for you , Kate ! __eou__ Thanks.Miss Zhang . __eou__ You know in China we usually don't open presents until the guests leave . __eou__ Really ? I've already opened this one.Say , this is sweater , and it's just what I need to go with my new suit.Thank you ever so much . __eou__
Do you like coffee , Ann ? __eou__ Yes , I do . __eou__ Do you want a cup ? __eou__ Yes , please . Christin . __eou__ Do you want any sugar ? __eou__ Yes , please . __eou__ Do you want any milk ? __eou__ No , thank you . I don't like milk in my coffee . I like black coffee . __eou__ Do you like biscuits ? __eou__ Yes , I do . __eou__ Do you want one ? __eou__ Yes , please . __eou__
Could you help me figure out why I am missing my unemployment check for this week ? __eou__ I hope that you remembered to send in your last Continued Claim Form . __eou__ I am pretty sure that I didn ’ t send that claim form in . __eou__ You have to send that form in every two weeks so we that we will know what to pay you . __eou__ Can I mail it in late ? __eou__ If it is not more than fourteen days past its due date , then you may still mail it in . __eou__ I think that I will mail it in right away when I get it next time , so I won ’ t be late . __eou__ You can ’ t mail it in early because you don ’ t know , in advance , how much you will be working . __eou__ Even though I was late turning in my form , will my paycheck be late ? __eou__ Yes , your check will be a little late in getting to you . __eou__
How do you like you dishes today ? __eou__ Not so delicious as before , but it's fine . The soup is tasty but the meat is a little tough . __eou__ I am sorry for that . We will improve the dishes next time . __eou__
Something's wrong with my air conditioning . __eou__ Leave it to me . I'll fix it . __eou__
So how long do you plan to live here ? __eou__ We'd like to sign a year-long contract , if that's OK . __eou__ Fine by me . Do you know how to read this kind of contract ? __eou__ Yes . We've signed them before . We even brought our chops . __eou__ Great . When in Rome , you guys know what to do . __eou__ We'll sign our signatures , too . And give you our passport numbers along with our ARC numbers . __eou__ That about does it . See you in a week . __eou__
So what are you doing for Thanksgiving ? __eou__ Not much really . It's more of an American tradition , so back home we don't really celebrate it . In fact , I am not even sure of what exactly is being celebrated ! __eou__ Well you know , it's a time to get together with all your family and be thankful for everything ! __eou__ Yeah but , how did this holiday come to be ? __eou__ Well , the first settlers of Massachusetts arrived there because of religious persecution from England and King James . Once in the New World , they befriended an native named Squanto , who taught them how to harvest food from the area such as corn . __eou__ And then what did happen ? __eou__ Well , they had enough harvests for the next winter and celebration 。 They decided to have a big feast for the natives , giving thanks the land , and everyone for the foods , healthy and new lives . __eou__ Interesting ! I am amazed how big and delicious thanksgiving dinners are ! __eou__ Come to my house for Thanksgiving ! We are having turkey , pumpkin pie , mashed potatoes with gravy , and lots of stuffing ! __eou__ Count me in ! __eou__
Hello . May I help you ? __eou__ Yeah , this dress is really nice ! How much is it ? __eou__ That one is one hundred and fifty dollars . __eou__ One hundred and fifty dollars ? What about this other one over here ? __eou__ That ’ s one hundred and forty . __eou__ Hmm ... that ’ s a bit out of my price range . Can you give me a better deal ? __eou__ This is an exclusive design by marco ! It ’ s a bargain at that price . __eou__ Well , I don ’ t know . I think I ’ ll shop around . __eou__ Okay , okay , how about one hundred dollars ? __eou__ That ’ s still more than I wanted to spend . What if I take both dresses ? __eou__ Okay , I can give you a special discount , just because you seem like a nice person . One hundred and ninety dollars for both . __eou__ I don ’ t know ... It ’ s still a bit pricey ... Thanks anyway . __eou__ my final price ! One hundred dollars for both ! That ’ s two for the price of one . That ’ s my last offer ! __eou__ Great ! You ’ Ve got a deal ! __eou__
John ? I have to say I was bothered by the way you handled the meeting today . __eou__ How so ? I thought it went fine . __eou__ I think it would have been better if you had given us more of a chance to give our opinions . __eou__ I ’ m sorry . I thought we were all pretty much in agreement . __eou__
Hi , how is it going ? __eou__ Pretty good , Sam . Only the awful weather , you know . __eou__ That ’ s right . I ’ Ve never really liked it since I got here . __eou__ Me either , but I ’ m dealing with it anyway . __eou__
How have you been doing ? __eou__ I can ’ t sleep or eat . I have a really bad pain in my tooth ! __eou__ How long have you had this toothache ? __eou__ It bothers me off and on , but it ’ s gotten much worse these past few weeks . __eou__ Is there anything that you ’ Ve done to your tooth that might have caused the pain ? __eou__ My girlfriend told me that I grind my teeth a lot when I sleep . Maybe that is the problem . __eou__ When you brush your teeth , what do you use ? __eou__ I use a soft bristle toothbrush . __eou__ Does it bother you when you have to chew a lot ? __eou__ Absolutely . That set it off big time ! __eou__
How was your trip to America ? __eou__ We had a fantastic time . __eou__ Did you go to the Magic Kingdom ? __eou__ No , but we went to the Kennedy Center . __eou__
Playing the chess is very exhausting , isn't ? __eou__ No , doing it in the long run will make you an acute man . __eou__ I'm afraid playing the chess like that will soon make me an old man . I noticed that most chess players were bald . __eou__ That's because you are always fixing your eyes on the bald . __eou__
I heard you were promoted to general manager of IBM's China Headquarters . __eou__ That's true . I got the news yesterday . __eou__ You did a good job for the company . You deserve it . __eou__ You're flattering me . __eou__ So . this is your first day in the new position . How do you feel ? __eou__ Not bad . I'm confident . And I like challenges . __eou__ I believe you are cut out for this position . You're an outstanding individual . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__

You ’ re busy with that contract . Maybe you could join us later ? __eou__ Unfortunately , I just can ’ t make it this time . I have to go straight home . It ’ s my second wedding anniversary , and we ’ re supposed to be having a big dinner Susan would kill me if I missed it . __eou__ Happy anniversary ! Sorry you won ’ t be there . Maybe some other time ? __eou__ Yeah , maybe . Thanks , anyway . Hope you guys have a great time ! __eou__
I would like to order a suit made to my own measure . __eou__ I share the same opinion . You are over-weight so it's hard for you to buy clothes . __eou__ Maybe I should try to lose weight . __eou__ Here is one tailor's shop . Why not order one here ? __eou__

Tell me , Mr . Han . What do you suggest if we establish long term business relations ? __eou__ Surely it's a sound idea , Mr . Joey . But I have a few questions for you first . __eou__ I am all ears . __eou__ First , can I know something about your financial situations ? __eou__ Sure . As for our financial situation , you can inquire about them in the national bank . They handle all our financial documents . __eou__ Thank you . And how is your business in the clothing business circle ? __eou__ A very good question . It's very honorable for me to tell you that our business relations cover all over the world and they all have very good business reputation . __eou__ Then what do you deal with ? __eou__ We deal with kid's clothing , women's clothing , and men's clothing . You name it we deal with it . __eou__ That's nice . They provided us with convenient choice . __eou__ As for the regular customers , we have some favorable terms for them . __eou__ I'd like to hear that . __eou__ For the substantial regular customers , we offer 5 % commissions . __eou__ That sounds attractive , all right , how about that we sign a one year contract ? __eou__ Fabulous . I will get the contract ready shortly . __eou__
Can you tell me the time ? I've got an appointment at 8: 30 . __eou__ It's 8 sharp by my watch . __eou__ Gee ! There's only thirty minutes to go . __eou__

I'd put a coat on if I were you . __eou__ It wasn't cold out this morning . __eou__ Well , it's started raining since then . Look out the window ! It's pouring rain out there ! __eou__ Well , I guess we'd better grab our umbrellas then , as well . __eou__ Have a look outside for me . Does that look like hail to you ? __eou__ It does , actually . Maybe we should wait for it to clear up before we go shopping . __eou__ That's a good idea . But maybe we should move the car so that the hail doesn't dent it . __eou__ Ok . I'll go move the car if you turn the heat on . It's a bit chilly in here . __eou__ How long do you think this hailstorm is supposed to last ? __eou__ I don't know . The weatherman didn't say anything about this in his weather report last night . __eou__ Maybe we should turn on the news in case it's supposed to get worse . __eou__ I don't think we have anything to worry about . Do you want to put on a cup of tea as well ? __eou__ Good idea . That will help us to warm up . __eou__ If I'm not back in ten minutes , come and find me . __eou__ Alright . I'll have a cup of tea waiting for you . __eou__
Yeah . Just pull on this strip . Then peel off the back . __eou__ You might make a few enemies this way . __eou__ If they don't think this is fun , they're not meant to be our friends . __eou__ You mean your friends . I think it's cruel . __eou__ Yeah . But it's fun . Look at those two ugly old ladies ... or are they men ? __eou__ Hurry ! Get a shot ! ... Hand it over ! __eou__ I knew you'd come around ... __eou__

The flood will come on the heels of the heavy rain . __eou__ I wonder if the municipal government will take some preventive measures . __eou__ I ’ m sure they will . __eou__
Have you watched today's news ? __eou__ No , I haven't . What's going on ? __eou__ Did you hear about last night's blackout ? __eou__ Yes . The lights were out all night . __eou__ Some people went looting because of the blackout . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ People decided to use the blackout to their advantage . __eou__ People went out and looted ? __eou__ I guess they broke into about four stores . __eou__ Did the police find who did it ? __eou__ There's no evidence of who it was . __eou__ I hope we don't have any more blackouts . __eou__

This means that no mistakes are made . __eou__ Your salesman also told me that each worker is trained to do quality analysis . Can you tell me a little about that ? __eou__ Certainly . We provide quality analysis training as part of the training for all new workers , plus a week of further training every year . __eou__

What do you think of our price ? __eou__ Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ? __eou__ Yes , we regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly . __eou__ I agree with you there , but you price is unreasonable . __eou__ I don't think so . You must compare our price with that it other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level . __eou__ I don't think we will be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % . __eou__ I'm afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price . __eou__ Don't you agree with me that in the long run moderate prices we bring about large sales and more profit ? __eou__ We've already cut down our price to cost level . __eou__ Is that all ? __eou__ Yes this is the best we can do . __eou__ I'm sorry , we can't handle the price you offered . __eou__
Can you make a suit for me to order ? __eou__ Certainly . Come and choose the cloth . __eou__ By the way , what's the charge for the tailoring ? __eou__ $ 150 including the cloth . __eou__

Here is your room . I hope you like it . __eou__ Looks not bad . __eou__ The room is away from traffic noise . __eou__ Yes , It's pleasantly quiet here . __eou__ Here's the bath . __eou__ Where can we have our laundry done ? __eou__ There's a bag in the bathroom .

See you then . __eou__ Well . I really do have to go . __eou__ Good night then . __eou__ See you tomorrow . __eou__

Janice , do you still remember how our filing system works ? __eou__ Yes , I have read the Filling Instruction carefully , since you showed me it last week . __eou__ Very good . What is the essence of filing , do you know ? __eou__ The essence of filing I remember is to bring together in a single folder or file all papers relating to a particular subject .

Do you like these candles ? They are on sale now . __eou__ All right . I will take one . __eou__
Your definition on success ? __eou__ Most people think that wealth means success . But from my point of view , the problem should be viewed from two aspects . On the one hand , wealth is a very important thing to measure success . The ability to make money , to some extent , signifies your knowledge , your capability , the value of your labor , etc .. With the development of our economy and industry , more and more people are pursuing money these days . And in toda / s society , If you have money , you seem to have everything . But this is not the case . I think success , on the other hand , also means satisfaction from work . It also means that you can get respect from others . __eou__ What ’ s your ideal job ? __eou__ Ideally , I ’ d like to have a job that will allow me to work from home several days a week . I ’ m the kind of person who can set priorities , work well independently , and set my own pace . I actually successfully worked from home for several months in my current job when a problematic pregnancy forced me to stay in bed . But I realize that many employers do not have experience with employees who work from home , and I have , of course , performed very successfully in a traditional office setting . __eou__ How would you describe your relationship with your last two supervisors ? __eou__ Very good . Basically , once our sales plan was put together , I had a great deal of freedom to handle my sales in the way I felt best . __eou__ How would your present boss describe you ? __eou__ He always says I am a hard worker with consciousness of responsibility , sufficient education , and enough experience . __eou__ What would your colleagues say about you ? __eou__ They would say I am a dependable friend and a capable colleague . __eou__
Nice to meet you . __eou__ It ’ s very nice meeting you , too . __eou__ I ’ m excited to speak to a candidate . __eou__ What would you like to ask me ? __eou__ What is your stand on gay marriage ? __eou__ I feel that people can love who they want . __eou__ So , would you make gay marriage legal ? __eou__ Of course ! __eou__ I ’ m sure plenty of people won ’ t like that . __eou__ I can ’ t help that . __eou__ I like that . __eou__ I hope so . __eou__
Good morning , Sir . __eou__ Morning . __eou__ Is this where I catch the bus for the zoo ? __eou__ Yes . You can take No . 846 from here , but you have to get off at Nanchengmen stop and change to No . 106 . __eou__ That ’ s a little troublesome . __eou__ Actually , if you go to the bus stop in the next block , you can take No . 105 which will let you right off in front of the zoo gate . __eou__ Maybe that ’ s what I'll do . Thanks a lot . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . __eou__

We have to sit at our assigned seats . I think our table is over there in the back . __eou__ Hmm . We don't exactly have the best seats in the house , do we ? __eou__ Look who you get to sit next to--Tim from purchasing ! __eou__ Www ! That weirdo ? ! He really gives me the creeps ! __eou__ Don't worry .

I've always loved working with children . __eou__
Well , you know what , don ’ t do it , ‘ cause the minute you do , they lose all respect for you . __eou__ Well , it ’ s not like that . We just e-mail , it ’ s really nothing . On top of which I am definitely thinking about stopping because it ’ s getting ... __eou__ Out of hand . __eou__ Confusing . But not , because it ’ s nothing . __eou__ Where ’ d you meet him ? __eou__ Oh , listen , I can ’ t even remember . Ok , on my birthday , I wandered into over 30 rooms , for a joke , sort of and he was there , and we started chatting ... __eou__ About what ? __eou__ Oh , books , and music , how much we both love New York . Harmless , harmless , meaningless . Bouquets of sharpened pencils . Oh . __eou__ Excuse me ? __eou__ Forget it . We don ’ t talk about anything personal , so I don ’ t know his name or what he does or where he lives exactly . So it ’ ll be really easy for me to stop seeing him , because I ’ m not ... __eou__
Hi , Li Ming . You look upset . What's the matter ? __eou__ There will be a parents ' meeting in our class this Saturday and I am worried about it . __eou__ Why ?

Bill . Bill ! You gotta help me ! __eou__ What ’ s wrong ? Slow down or you are gonna give yourself a heart attack . __eou__ Tomorrow is Christmas and I haven ’ t bought my mom anything ! I ’ m such a bad son ! __eou__ Take it easy ! Let ’ s go to the mall , window shop a little and see if there is anything she might like . __eou__ That ’ s just it ! I don ’ t know what to get her ! Last year I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small ! I suck at getting presents for people . __eou__ That ’ s where you ’ re making a big mistake ! You can ’ t just guess peoples ’ likes or sizes ! Especially with clothes or jewelry . On top of that , I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her . At the same time you should show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like ! __eou__ Yeah , you ’ re right . When it comes down to it , I can be pretty tacky . __eou__ Yeah , tell me about it . I know ! Your mom is trying to learn Spanish , right ?

Good morning , everybody . Welcome to IAM Technology . I'm very pleased so many of you could make it here today . My name's Sam Weiss . I'm the Production Manager . I'd like to show you the layout of the factory before we go and visit it . As you can see from this diagram , everything is under one roof . We've designed it this way to help the flow of materials and to avoid bottlenecks . __eou__ This area here is where we keep our raw materials . The main production area - our machine hall - is situated next to it . Maintenance is situated between the stores and the production area . Just to the right of Maintenance , there are steps up to the Lab and the Admin Section . Process Control is also on the upper level . It's located above the factory floor so that the operators can monitor everything that is going on below . __eou__
what do you think about the public service advertisement for quiting smoking ? __eou__ while I think it's great that they're trying to get people to quit smoking , but I don't really care for the advertisement . __eou__ why not ? __eou__ the fish hook that they use is quite disturbing ! __eou__ it's a pun . They use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking . __eou__ I know , but I think it's not really appropriate for young children . __eou__ I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking . __eou__ all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty . __eou__ perhaps you're right , , though . Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow . __eou__ I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them . __eou__ that's a good point . I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad . __eou__ you have to give them credit , though . It's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking . __eou__
Mr . Wang , I want to apologize for being late again this morning . I just can't get up in time for work . __eou__ So it seems . And what are you going to do about that ? __eou__ I guess I'll have to buy a new alarm clock . __eou__

It's a good thing for him to live with his son . __eou__ I know that . But it's pity for us to lose such a good neighbour . You know I always appreciate Tom's company . __eou__ Me too . But anyway we hope he lives happily in the future . __eou__
Can you tell me where the pots and pans are ? __eou__ Pots and pans are right over there . __eou__ Oh , thank you . __eou__ Could I interest you in our store credit card ? __eou__ No , thanks .

This sort of thing happens all the time to everyone . __eou__ Yeah . I guess it does . Sorry again for bothering you . __eou__ No worries . __eou__

My bike has one under the seat . Get it , quick ! __eou__ There's some tape , iodine , and cloth bandages . I don't think the cloth bandages can stop the bleeding . What we need is a tourniquet . __eou__ Wrap a few loops of the bandages around my upper arm , then twist.That will work as a tourniquet.After that , you can cut more of the bandages to cover the wound . __eou__ Good plan . Let me put some iodine on the cut . __eou__ No , forget that ! Do the tourniquet first . I'm losing too much blood . __eou__ Alright , alright . How did you cut this so bad ? __eou__ I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed . What do you think ? Damn , it hurts ! __eou__ We'll have to get you to a hospital . I can ride you on the back of my bike . __eou__ I'm lucky I wasn't killed . I must have been going around forty-five miles an hour.There was too much gravel on that corner . I slid out . __eou__ Yes , I almost slid too.Alright . This tourniquet is tight . How does it feel ? __eou__ Make it tighter . I want the blood stopped.Then wrap some bandages around the cut . Then we can go . Ouch ! I hope I can walk . __eou__ Alright , I'm twisting it around . You tell me when to stop . __eou__ There . Stop ! __eou__

I can't guarantee 1 500 cases , I'd prefer the first shipment to be 1,000 cases and the next 2,000 cases . __eou__ I can agree to that . __eou__ Let me affirm this again - the first shipment of 1,000 cases , to be delivered in 27 days , by June 30 , and the second shipment of 2,000 cases by August 15 .

It's very expensive because the government recently introduced a landfill tax so we're planning to build a new incineration plant next year to burn our waste . __eou__ But doesn't incineration produce carbon monoxide ? __eou__ Yes , you're right , it does .

Can they also arrive at our company quickly ? __eou__ We can deliver the balance at the price already quoted in 10 days . __eou__ Can you deliver them earlier ? __eou__ I am afraid we can not do that . Would you be willing to sign an annual contract on the basis we discussed ? __eou__ Possibly , subject to quality and delivery guarantees . __eou__ Of course . Well , in that case we could offer a 5 % discount for a confirmed monthly order for the next 12 months . __eou__ I was looking forward to something a bit more substantial . As you know , we have long-time cooperation . __eou__ I'm afraid that's as far as we could go . We'd already be stretching ourselves to the limit . __eou__ Well , let's shake on that and draw up the details of the contract . __eou__

Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set ? __eou__ We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? That will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock . __eou__ You can double check with the housekeeping department , but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order . __eou__ OK , I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it ? __eou__ I think the only thing is toner . Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . Anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time . __eou__ OK , will do . __eou__
David , imagine meeting you here ! __eou__ Janice , I found you stole my vegetables at four o'clock this morning . Is that true ? __eou__ All right !

I also got something this morning . __eou__ How many vegetables do you steal today ? __eou__ I stole many from Fred's farm , and from yours . I planned to have a dog on farm . __eou__ So funny . By stealing , I forgot all my sorrows and pressure from work . __eou__ I could not agree with you more . For us , there are so many unhappy things and I am so bored ; however , I got lots of fun from stealing . __eou__ I really want to be far away from the reality now . __eou__ But we still need to go back to it . Don't overdo it . __eou__
Lucy , what are your priorities when buying a car ? __eou__ I guess the first thing is the price , the second is the size , and of course the color will play a role too . But I have to be honest . It is our today ’ s responsibility to take care about our environment . Therefore , I will also pay attention to the fuel consumption of the car . You know , the rise in gasoline prices is huge . So I would rather to consider a smaller car with smaller engine . For which I can also save some tax . Last of the list , I also consider the safety . __eou__ What about the environmental factors ? __eou__ Well , I do prefer the lower emission cars as long as it doesn ’ t cost much . Some environmentally-friendly cars are really expensive . __eou__ Sure they are . Some hi-tech devices are built in to make sure they pollute less . Some of these green cars have not become standard . So the production costs are still high . But anyway , we should make efforts to start with . __eou__
Are you familiar with the office management ? __eou__ I have done something like that before . __eou__ Are you still interested in it ? __eou__ I think I am . I left the job only because it was too far from my home . __eou__

How was my singing ? __eou__ Not bad at all . __eou__

What can I do for you today ? __eou__ I need to return a book . __eou__ Can I do anything else for you ? __eou__ I want to check these books out . __eou__ Is that all ? __eou__ That ’ s all . __eou__ May I see your library card , please ? __eou__ It ’ s right here . __eou__ Will that be all for today ? __eou__ Yes . That ’ s it . __eou__ These are due back in two weeks . __eou__ All right . Have a good night . __eou__
Are you ok , Chuck ? You look pale . __eou__ I'm fine , Katherine . I just stayed up late last night working on my Chinese . __eou__ Oh , poor you . You know what ? I found a new way to learn Chinese and it works very well . __eou__ You did ? Do tell me . I've spent all these months trying to learn something new about it , but I've made little progress ! __eou__ Sure . I'm learning Chinese through songs . __eou__ So you're learning Chinese songs ? __eou__ You can say that . I can actually sing some of them now . __eou__ That's a real achievement . How did you do that ? __eou__ I start by listening to the song a few times and after several times I am able to follow the singer . __eou__ It makes sense . __eou__ It does . I've learned some Chinese folk songs this way . They are clearly presented and easy to follow . __eou__ Can Join you , Katherine ? I do want to have a try . __eou__ Why not ? I downloaded a beautiful song the other day . We can learn it together now . __eou__ Great . Do you think we need a Chinese dictionary ? __eou__ Yes , just in case we run into me new characters . __eou__ Ok . I will bring it with me . __eou__
Why have you decided to change jobs ? __eou__ I hope to change because my current job is not within my chosen field . Since my major was international banking , I really hope to work at a bank . __eou__ Then , why do you want to work for our bank since it's a new establishment in Shanghai ? __eou__ Because your bank is a new one , I think I'll be given more opportunities , and the working conditions and surroundings are so excellent here . __eou__ It certainly is . But the work is also hard here . You need to put a lot of long hard hours on the job to succeed in this field . __eou__ I expect to work hard , madam . __eou__ Do you mind going on frequent business trips ? __eou__ No , I enjoy travelling . __eou__
Hey Claire , you've been really quiet these last few days . Is something wrong ? __eou__ I've been really stressed . It's the end of the year and I've got so much stuff to do ! I feel like I'm drowning in work . __eou__ Well , stress is a real thing . It's not an imaginary condition . __eou__ It's seriously affecting my life ! I can't sleep , I don't have much of an appetite and my husband says I've been kind of short tempered . Other people seem to handle stress okay ... why am I so weak ? __eou__ You're not weak ... you're stressed out ! Stress has been a part of the human condition for millions of years . Back when we still lived in the trees we had to watch out for predators ... and as you might imagine , that was pretty stressful . __eou__ Yeah , but I don't see any tigers or leopards roaming around our office . My stress is just about silly paperwork ! __eou__ But you're actually having the same reaction as our tree-dwelling ancestors ! It's called the flight or fight response . Each time you feel like something's threatening you , your body decides whether to run away or fight ... it causes all sorts of chemical reactions in the body . __eou__ So a deadline will cause that same reaction ? __eou__ It could . Modern humans actually have more flight or fight responses than our ancestors did . They just had a couple of close calls every day , but today , we have dozens or even hundreds ! __eou__ So the life of a cave woman was less stressful than my life ? __eou__
May I introduce myself ? I am steven smith . __eou__ Glad to meet you mr smith my name is jenny . __eou__
Excuse me . Where are you going ? __eou__ Oh , I'm a tourist . May I go inside and look around ? __eou__ I'm afraid you can't today . __eou__ When can I go inside then ? __eou__ Only on Saturday and Sunday from one to five p . m . __eou__
I have a terrible toothache . __eou__ Which tooth is it ? __eou__ This one here . __eou__ Ar , Yes . There ’ s a big cavity . __eou__ Can you fill it ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid not . The tooth is too far gone . it'll have to be taken out . __eou__ Then I might as well have it done now . __eou__ you ’ d better wait , the gums are swollen . Take the medicine I prescribe and come back in three days . __eou__
Do you like tea ? __eou__ Yes , but I don't know much about it . __eou__ Tea does good to people's health . There are many kinds of tea.Say , black tea , green tea , scented tea , brick tea , milk tea , Jas - mine tea , chrysanthemum tea and so on . __eou__ My favourite is Jasmine tea . I like its aroma . __eou__ Yeah , but scented tea is now in fashion . __eou__
What's wrong with you ? __eou__ I'm trying to send the instruction book by E-mail , but I failed many , many times . And there is something wrong with the net maybe . It's so slow . __eou__ Well , maybe the net is slow now . Try it again . __eou__ I am used to editing with Word 2003 , and there are many pictures in the book . __eou__ It's beyond question . You can save it the same as a document . __eou__ I merely know how to send the direct letter . But I am not familiar with the attachment . __eou__ It's the same as usual . The only difference lies in that you need to paste the book as an attachment . __eou__ Can I mail the book if it is a large file ? __eou__ There are limitations to the capacity of an E-mail . Commonly it's no more than 4 MB . __eou__ What if it exceeds the capacity ? __eou__ You can divide it into several documents to mail . Or you can download the mentioned software from the warning . __eou__
What's going on here ? __eou__ We're waiting in line to get one of Master Li's Chinese couplets . I got one last year and I had good luck all year ! __eou__ Master Li ? Who's that ? __eou__ He's Taipei's most famous calligraphy master ! Quick ! Get in line ! __eou__ I will ! I could use some good luck ! __eou__
I find it really hard to express myself in class . I have lots of ideas , but they never seem to come out of my mouth . __eou__ let me give you a little advice . You know what the topics are going to be , so prepares what you would like to say in advance . __eou__ I often do , but I ’ m worried about the responses from other people . __eou__ you have to be realistic . Not everyone is going to agree with you , but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion . __eou__ I ’ m worried that what I say will not make sense . __eou__ we could chat about the topic before class . I could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . What should I do if I am in two minds about a topic ? __eou__ that ’ s easy . Express possibilities . People will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle . __eou__ I didn ’ t realize that speaking in class could be so easy . __eou__ the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say . They will reply to your statements , but you can ’ t be sure how . __eou__
Thank God ! I am finished writing that service guide ! It took me forever ! __eou__ When did you finish ? __eou__ This morning ! No more overtime , and no more headaches ! __eou__ Well , I ’ m glad to hear it . Have a cup of coffee ! __eou__

What are you thinking you would like to do ? __eou__ Right now , I ’ ll take about anything that will pay the mortgage . __eou__ Have you gone out on any interviews so far ? __eou__ I went out on one interview , but I haven ’ t heard back from them . __eou__ Did you see the posting for the electrician apprentice program ? __eou__ You know , I saw that and it looks pretty good ! __eou__ Let ’ s go check it out again ! __eou__
Sit down , please . Mr . Tang , do you bring any paper or certificate with you ? __eou__ Thank you .

Damn Scott . You got big . __eou__ Yeah , I've been working out a lot . __eou__ How long have you been lifting weights ? __eou__ For a year and a half . __eou__ Yeah . Last time I saw you , it was like 2 years ago . __eou__ Has it been that long ? __eou__ How often do you go to the gym ? __eou__ I usually go every other day for about 3 hours . __eou__ That's a lot . __eou__ Yeah , I used to work out for an hour a day 4 times a week , and I saw no results . This is what you have to do to get noticeable results . __eou__ I don't think I have the discipline for that . __eou__ Just think of it as a hobby . Then it's actually fun . __eou__
I have some photos here taken by myself . Would you like to see them ? __eou__ Sure . Speaking of photos , what type of film will be the best ?

How much do I owe you ? __eou__ That will be 3.50 dollars . __eou__ Here is 4 dollars , keep the change . __eou__ Thank you very much . Come back to see us . __eou__
The product's selling points is its advanced technoledge . __eou__ Unfortunately , it's just too expensive for majority of consumer to afford . __eou__ Why is the price so high ? __eou__ It's not just that the price is high , it's that the overhead to update an entire computer system to be compatible is costly . __eou__ Model of computers aren't compatible ? __eou__ Most current computer systems simply can't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities . __eou__ Maybe after the next generation of technology comes out , the price of this model will become more affordable . __eou__ But by then , the technology will be outdated . __eou__ True , but our focus has never been affordability anyway . Coastwise , we may not be very competitive , but qualitywise , we definitely have an edge . __eou__ That's right , no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable . __eou__ This model has advanced technoledge , superior components , it is compact , and it's a top-quality product . __eou__ I guess you get what you pay for . __eou__
Are you new here ? __eou__ This is my first day here . __eou__ Are you a freshman in college ? __eou__ I started school somewhere else . __eou__ What school did you transfer from ? __eou__ I started at PCC . __eou__ What made you transfer ? __eou__ My grades weren ’ t good enough to go here . __eou__ Did you like PCC ? __eou__ I loved PCC . __eou__ Good luck here . __eou__ I ’ m excited to be here . __eou__
Look , there is traffic accident over there . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ The old man is knocked down by the bicycle . __eou__
What is your most preferred training method ? __eou__ Well , I prefer active rather than passive training . For example , I like the training offered by a financial software company from which we bought the newest updated virgin . They sent the programmers to demonstrate how to do and then ask us to practice . All employees receiving this training were in the same meeting room , so we could communicate with each other . We had a lot of fun learning together . It helps to build up the work relation among colleagues . __eou__ Well , that is also very efficient , right ? __eou__ Of course , it is much better than just giving us some reading materials or information via the internet . __eou__ That ’ s boring . Once we were asked to watch a video on how to operate the punches , all of us seemed to fall into sleep by the end of the video . __eou__
How nice these frames are ! __eou__ Yes , they are the latest designs . Would you like to try them on ? __eou__ I want to try on this pair . __eou__ The oval shape one ? __eou__ That's right . __eou__ I think it suits you well . __eou__ I agree , but I like wire frames . __eou__ How about this ? They're the same shape . __eou__
What's the fare , please ? __eou__ Twenty dollars and sixty cents . __eou__ What ? You're overcharging me ! __eou__ No way . Look . That's what the meter says . __eou__ Then something must be wrong with the meter . __eou__
How do you feel about this restaurant ? __eou__ I really liked it ! __eou__ I really enjoyed the food . __eou__ What did you enjoy the most ? __eou__ I enjoyed the fish the most . __eou__ The fish was pretty special , but I loved the dessert . __eou__ The macadamia cake was out-of-this-world ! __eou__ I really felt that the service was exceptionally good . __eou__ Yes , the service really added to the experience . __eou__ I am looking forward to returning to this restaurant . __eou__
Bill , will you be free at noon ? __eou__ Yes . What can I do for you ? __eou__ We need a new filing cabinet in the office . Could you go downtown with me after lunch ? __eou__ All right . Have you got an idea about what type to buy ? __eou__ Yes , the same as the one we have . And we also need some small articles in the office , such as pens , clips , erasers and sticky notes . __eou__ Can you remember them all ? __eou__ Susan has already given me a list of all the stationery which we need to buy . __eou__
It may comfort you to know that many people attended his viewing . __eou__ How did they hear ? No one called . __eou__ In times of loss , it is often hard to pick up the phone . But his whole family was here . __eou__ His mom and dad must be destroyed . He was their only son . __eou__ And he was so young , with so much life to look forward to . __eou__ Yes ... thank you for understanding . We have to go now . __eou__ This sheet tells the visiting hours and funeral time and location . __eou__
Kate , will you please make ten copies of this report ? __eou__ I'd like to , but the photocopier is out of order . __eou__ Then use the xerox machine . __eou__ It broke down one year ago . __eou__ Oh , forget it then . Hey , I told you to put the files on the in tray , not on my desk . __eou__ The pile is over ten feet high . I am afraid it will fall all over and bury you underneath it if I put this file on top of it . __eou__ Very funny . What's wrong with you today ? You are my secretary and you are not supposed to talk to me in that tone of voice . Do you know that ? __eou__ What do you expect ? I've been working for you for three years , and you've never given me a holiday . I don't feel well today , because I have a terrible headache . I am not in the mood for being gentle and polite . If you can't stand it , it's your problem . I am not going to change , because I think it suits you best . __eou__ Keep your voice down , Kate . I know you've had a hard day today , but you should at least show some respect for me . If you really don't feel well , go home . There isn't much work today anyway . __eou__ I apologize for forgetting myself , but I do need some time off . __eou__
Please pull your vehicle over to the side of the road . Please roll down your window . __eou__ What's the matter , sir ? __eou__ Have you been drinking ? __eou__ No , I haven't sir . __eou__ Really ? But I can smell alcohol on your breath . Blow into this breathalyzer , please . __eou__ But , sir , I didn't drink at all . __eou__ If you refuse to blow , you'll receive a much severer punishment . __eou__ OK . I'll blow . __eou__ Your BAC exceeds the legal limit . __eou__ But I ... __eou__ I'll have to write you a ticket and suspend your driver's license for 3 months . __eou__
Would you like to come by and play bridge ? __eou__ Well , let's see . Why don't we go dancing for a change ? We haven't done that for a long time . __eou__ Well , to tell the truth , I don't really feel like it tonight . I had a pretty hard day and I'm sort of tired . __eou__ Hmm . Well , in that case , we could go to the movies . __eou__ Oh , we always go to the movies . Can't we do something different ? __eou__ Well , do you have any suggestions ? __eou__ Let's see . How do you feel about playing bridge ? __eou__ It's OK with me , but we don't have any beer and things . __eou__ Well , shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over , and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff . __eou__ OK . __eou__ Hello , Janet . It's me ... Oh , fine . Just fine . Say , Janet , I was wondering if you and Tom were doing anything tonight ... No ? Well . would you like to come by our place and play a few hands of bridge ? __eou__
OK . Steven , you're looking at a picture . Please describe what you see ! __eou__ Uh , I can see a red double decker bus . It's the kind of bus you'll see very often in London . In fact I know this bus is from London because I can see the names , Chelsea , Sloan Square , Victoria , Herring Cross . These are all areas in London . Um , so obviously the bus is in London . __eou__ OK . Have you ever been on a double decker bus ? __eou__ Yeah , yeah , yeah . many times . Many times . When I was younger , you used to get double-decker all over England but now you only tend to see them in the big cities . __eou__ Oh , really . Mm ! How much is the fare ? __eou__ Well , it depends on the journey . It's .. I guess it's not too expensive , but the minimum price you would pay is , for a short journey , is about a pound . __eou__ Mm , yeah , who can you see on the bus ? Can you pick out anyone on the bus who looks interesting ? __eou__ Hmm , yeah , well this girl here at the back , that's leaning on the door , um , she looks really bored , actually . Maybe she is going to work or something and she doesn't want to go ! __eou__ Is that how you feel on the bus ? __eou__ Uh , well , no , not really , because I haven't worked in England for a long time , so I haven't taken a bus for a long time . __eou__ So , so you're British , do you missing them ? __eou__ Um , yes , sometimes . Sometimes . __eou__
Isn't this fun ? __eou__ I have no idea what I'm doing . __eou__ Just follow the foot movements . Brush left , brush right ... yeah ! That's it ! __eou__ Whoa ! We're changing partners now ? Where do I go ? __eou__ Let the men take the lead ! __eou__ Whoa ! Oh , no ! __eou__ Oops ! __eou__
Michael Johnson doesn ’ t look graceful , but he sure is powerful . __eou__ If I were on as many steroids as he was , I think I ’ d be powerful , too . __eou__ What are you talking about ? ! He ’ s passed every drug test he ’ s taken ! __eou__ Those drug tests don ’ t mean anything ! He probably took some other drugs to mask the steroids . __eou__ Just because Ben Johnson was juiced up doesn ’ t mean all athletes are . __eou__ OK , OK . I ’ m feeling a little dehydrated . Let ’ s get something to drink . __eou__
Good afternoon , Sam . __eou__ Good afternoon , Tina . __eou__ What are you going to do tomorrow ? __eou__ I'm not sure yet . And you ? __eou__ I would like to go skating . Feel like going with me ? __eou__ Is skating interesting ? __eou__ I think so . Fresh air , white snow . It's so comfortable . __eou__ But I can't skate well . __eou__ It doesn't matter , I can teach you . __eou__ It's very kind of you . __eou__
I really admire you , Diana . __eou__ why , Jerry ? Your words just came out of the blue . __eou__ you are really happy and able to achieve high scores at school . __eou__ I work very hard and that's it , you know , practice makes perfect . __eou__ isn't there anything else ? __eou__ I have no idea . __eou__ you must have a high IQ score . __eou__ well , Jerry , let me tell you a secret . __eou__ go ahead . __eou__ my IQ score is slightly above average . __eou__ seriously ? But you are such a genius . __eou__ maybe I've got a higher EQ . I'm not sure . __eou__ well , perhaps you're right . Sometimes EQ matters more than IQ . __eou__ you can say that again , Jerry . And I'm sure you're high in both of them . With a little more time cracking the books , you can also get high marks . __eou__ oh , thank you . I'm going to the library , are you coming ? __eou__ let's go ! __eou__

But I may go out . __eou__ Where have you planned to go ? __eou__ I want to go to Shanghai , but I also want to visit Hainan . __eou__ Then which will be your first choice ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . How about you ? are you staying here or somewhere . __eou__ I have decided to go to Tasha . __eou__ By train or by plane ? __eou__ By plane . __eou__
Wow , is that your sports car ? __eou__ Yes , do you like it ? __eou__ I love it ! I used to always want to drive a green jaguar . Is it in good condition ? __eou__ Yt looks good on the outside , but the inside is a different story . It needs a lot of servicing before it can go out on the roads again . __eou__ What's wrong with it ? __eou__ Well , first of all , it needs a new engine , which is extremely expensive . __eou__ When's the last time you had it serviced ? __eou__ It must have been a few years ago now . __eou__ I thought all cars needed regular servicing on a yearly basis . __eou__ They do . Once my son was born , there was no reason to drive this car anymore . It's only a two-seater , you know ! __eou__ What else is wrong with it ? __eou__ The heating controls don't work anymore , so it always feels like it's about 100 degrees in the car — even in the summer ! __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ The brakes don't really work that well anymore either . __eou__ Why don't you get it all fixed ? __eou__ It costs more than you think to run a car---especially when there are so many things wrong with it ! __eou__ Well , let me know when you can get it fixed . I ’ d love to go for a ride in it ! __eou__
Well , we didn't ask for this room service maybe someone else ask it , I ’ m sure . __eou__ Oh , is it ?

Hello . Where are you headed today ? __eou__ I'm off to Barcelona for a week . __eou__ Do you have your passport with you ? __eou__ Yes , here you go . I don't need a visa to go to Spain , do I ? __eou__ Fortunately for you , you don't . Next time , if you have any questions about visas , you should try to find out before you get to the airport . __eou__ That's good advice . __eou__ Would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ? __eou__ Are there any seats available by the emergency exits ? __eou__ Let me see here ... yes , there's one left . __eou__ Ok . I'll take that one then . __eou__ Alright . How many pieces of luggage are you checking in ? __eou__ I like to travel light so I just have this one . __eou__ If that's your only piece of luggage , it is small enough to carry on with you . Would you like to do that so you don't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ? __eou__ Yes , please . That's a fantastic idea . Which gate do I need to go to ? __eou__ You're here a bit early , so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about a half hour . Here's your boarding pass . Enjoy your flight ! __eou__
Excuse me , how do I get to the Forbidden City ? __eou__ Follow this road and turn right at the second intersection . It'll be right there . __eou__ Is it far ? __eou__ No , it should only take you about 15 minutes by foot . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
I'm pleased to meet you again , Mrs . King . __eou__ Pleased to see you , too , Mr . Brown . __eou__ You've had a good trip , I hope . __eou__ Yes , a very pleasant journey , thank you . __eou__ It's been a full two years since we last saw each other . __eou__ So it is , I've come again to renew our sole agency agreement for another 2 years . __eou__ We shall be pleased to talk the matter over with you . You've done very well in fulfilling the agreement . __eou__ I'm glad you're satisfied with our work . I can assure you we've spared no effort and spent quite a sum of money in pushing the sales of your products . __eou__ Yes , we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos . We can see you are experienced in this particular line . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ But I think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in Canada is rather conservative . After all , you sold around 400 pieces there last year . You can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end . __eou__ That is the result of our hard work . Well , what annual quantity would you suggest for the new agreement then ? __eou__ 500 pieces . __eou__ No , no . That's too big a number to be acceptable . Let's put it at 450 pieces . And we'll strive to sell more , of course . We wish to add another clause . For every 50 pieces sold in excess of the quota , we'll get 1 % more in commission for our efforts . __eou__ All right , let's fix it at 450 pieces then . And for every additional 50 pianos sold , we'll give you 1 % higher commission . __eou__ I suppose all the other terms remain unchanged . __eou__ We would like to make a specific mention of one more point . As our sole distributor , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own . __eou__ No , certainly not . That's a reasonable restriction . __eou__ Another thing is that every six months we would like to receive from you a detailed report on current market conditions and the users comments on our products . __eou__ Yes , we've already prepared one . I've brought it with me . I'll put it forward when we talk with the manufacturers tomorrow . __eou__ Good , that's all then . __eou__ Good . __eou__
Excuse me , is this the parcel post counter ? __eou__ No , it's at counter 1 , right over there . __eou__ ( At counter 1 . ) Do you take parcels here ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I want to send this package to Los Angeles , please . __eou__ Do you want to send it by air or by regular mail ? __eou__ I'd like to send it by regular mail . __eou__ I ’ ll have to weigh it first . 120 yuan , please . __eou__ Here is 200 . __eou__ Your change , please . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__

Once a month I invite the most productive employee to dinner . __eou__ Well , there is no problem there .

Our company is going to do some cutbacks soon . __eou__ Really ? Where did you hear that ? __eou__ I met with the supervisor just this morning . I don't know , but I am a little worried . Who do you think will get sacked ? __eou__ I'm not sure ... well , first , it couldn't be George . He is such a kiss-ass . He'd wash the boss's dog if he asked . __eou__ No , it's not going to be George . I don't think it's Andy either . He is involved with the boss's sister in-law . And you know how whipped our boss is . __eou__ That's true . What about Lisa ? I bet there's nobody who could do a worse job than her . __eou__ Lisa ? No way . I've heard a rumor that she and the boss were having an affair . You know rumors can't come out from nowhere . __eou__ Well , okay . Then there is still Michael . But he's the boss ' pet after having the best sales record for three months in a row . It definitely won't be Michael . __eou__ No , that would be crazy . But then who will it be ? Oh dear , it must be me . I should have known it ! Why else would he have talked to me alone about the downsizing . What should I do ? I've got a family to support . __eou__ Well , it could be me too . But I am not too worried . This place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hard-ass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning . It would almost be a blessing to be fired from this place . __eou__

I'll pick you up at 6:00 . __eou__ Thank you for inviting me . See you then . Bye , Tom . __eou__

So , I want you to prepare an instruction book with detailed introduction of our products . This introduction will be presented in the meeting . __eou__ I get it . And ... ? __eou__ Remember to add an agenda for this meeting and show our warm welcome to them . __eou__ How about adding some pictures of our products for the introduction ? __eou__ Good idea ! The pictures will illustrate the performance of our products vividly . __eou__ OK , I will prepare it right now . __eou__ A , do your best , it's very important . __eou__ Please trust me . I will finish it very well . __eou__
Is this a photo of your family ? __eou__ Yes , it is.It was taken just before I was leaving for college . __eou__ You look so lovely . __eou__ How time flies ! I'll not see twenty again . __eou__
When the rain stops , you ’ ll see how beautiful the beach is . __eou__ But the rain has been pouring down for two days . We ’ Ve both caught colds . __eou__ And this bedroom is too big and damp . But it ’ s better than a tent . __eou__ How unlucky ! Let ’ s pack our bags and go home . __eou__
What's that ? __eou__ It's my new pendant . Do you like it ? __eou__ Is that Hello Kitty ? __eou__ Yes , in a monkey suit . It's adorable ! __eou__ Is it real gold ? __eou__ Yeah . Two-toned , white and yellow . __eou__

Good morning , Miss Cai . Congratulations ! You ’ Ve passed the interview . __eou__ Good morning , Mr . Yang . Thank you very much . Can I work now ? __eou__ Oh . Take it easy . As I ’ Ve said in the interview , once you are employed , we ’ ll give you a probation period of three months . And now we need to sign a draft agreement for the probation period . __eou__ I am sorry , I am just too excited and forget it . Can I look it through ? __eou__ Of course , here you are . And you can ask me any question . __eou__ Well , I am sorry that I have a question . There is no remuneration item in this agreement . Can you tell me something about it ? __eou__ Well , according to the principle of our company , employees like you have no remuneration during the probation period . __eou__ But you didn ’ t tell me in the interview . __eou__ I am sorry , it ’ s not decided by me but by the company . __eou__ Okay , I can ’ t decide whether sign or not now . Can you give me some time to think it over ? __eou__ Okay . Can you give me a reply tomorrow ? __eou__ Yes . Thank you very much . Mr . Yang . __eou__
Have you ever gotten a parking ticket ? __eou__ I've gotten a few . __eou__ How many is a few ? __eou__ I've gotten about six . __eou__ Have you paid all your tickets off ? __eou__ Yes , I've paid all of them off . __eou__ How much is the fine ? __eou__ It's like $ 130 each ticket . __eou__ That's not cheap at all . __eou__ I got a parking ticket the other day . __eou__ Pay it off , and they'll clear your record . __eou__ I'm going to do that as soon as possible . __eou__
Solomon , I thought we had agreed to change this deadline . __eou__ I wanted to talk to you about that , Mr . Eng . Mr . Emory would prefer to keep the deadline as is . We can start earlier if you ’ d like . __eou__ I ’ ll have to think about that , Ms . Solomon . __eou__ Certainly , sir . We can wait another day or two . __eou__
Maybe you should talk to the teacher . __eou__ No , it's no use . __eou__ You never know unless you try . __eou__ I know . She won't change my grade . __eou__
If you go out recently you will find some people riding scooters in high streets and back lanes . __eou__ Yes . The German engineer would never dreamed that the hand - supported scooter he invented several years ago to solve his traffic problems would become so fashionable in the Occident within a few years and even spread to Japan and China . __eou__ Looking at the ' five sense organs ' of a scooter , it can be said as delicate and agile . To pull the T-shaped pole and make it vertical with the flat board and then pull it vertically , adjust its height suitable to you and you may use it . __eou__ Small and exquisite in size , easy to operate , foldable and easy to carry are its charms . __eou__ Your two hands hold the pole , stand on the board , the other foot steps back against the ground and controls well the balance of the body , then you can ride in the air . It has a feeling of surfing . You need not let other people teach you . Your fear will disappear quickly . __eou__
When was America discovered , Tony ? __eou__ I'm not certain . Do you know ? __eou__ America was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492 . __eou__ In a way that's right . But the Vikings travelled there long beforeColumbus . And what about the Red Indians ? __eou__ All right . Ask me a question now . __eou__ Who invented the electric light bulb ? __eou__ That's easy . It was invented by Edison . __eou__ Correct . Now for a harder question . Who will be the first men on Mars ? __eou__ I can't answer that . But I think Mars will be visited by men before theed of this century . __eou__ Ask me a question now . __eou__ All right . What is the nearest planet to the sun ? __eou__ That's easy . It's .. er . Venus . NO . Pluto . No . Wait a minute . It's Anthe tip of my tongue . Oh dear , what is the nearest planet to the sun ? __eou__
Ladies and gentlemen , now we are in the National Forest Park . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ The stone is a prehistoric log . It was turned to stone millions of years ago . __eou__ Really ? It's unbelievable . __eou__ But it's the truth . __eou__ Do you have Ginkgo trees here ? __eou__ We don't have them here , I'm afraid . Ginkgo trees grow well only in cold weather . __eou__ What are these trees opposite to the pine trees ? __eou__ They are poplar trees . They are widely used in our lives . __eou__ I think I know that . __eou__
How do you feel about that restaurant ? __eou__ It wasn't all that great . __eou__ What did you dislike the most ? __eou__ I don't think that they had their act together . They didn't seem well prepared . __eou__ Did you think that the food was any good ? __eou__ I wasn't all that impressed by the food . __eou__ The service certainly could have been better . __eou__ The service did not help the situation . __eou__ Is this a restaurant that you want to come back to ? __eou__ I am not interested in trying this restaurant again . __eou__
Is your lady beautiful ? Since I came here from the country , I've not seen her close . Tell me , is she beautiful ? __eou__ Thomas , if I could write with the beauty in her eyes , I was born to look in them and know myself . __eou__ And , her lips ? __eou__ Her lips ? The early morning rose would wither on the branch if it could feel envy . __eou__ And her voice like a lark's song ? __eou__ Deeper , softer , none of your twittering larks . I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupted her song . __eou__ Oh , she sings too ? __eou__ Constantly . Without doubt , and plays the lute . She has a natural ear . __eou__
You received a letter in the mail . __eou__ Give it here . __eou__ Who ’ s the letter from ? __eou__ I think it ’ s my acceptance letter from NYU . __eou__ I want to know what it says . __eou__ They didn ’ t accept me . __eou__ Are you serious ? __eou__ It ’ s the truth . __eou__ Are you okay ? __eou__ I really wanted to get into NYU . __eou__ I am really sorry to hear that . __eou__ It ’ s okay . I ’ m still waiting to hear from UCLA anyway . __eou__
I have a sweet tooth . Chocolate is my favorite . So how about you ? __eou__ So do I . __eou__
Hello , may I help you ? __eou__ I'd like to send a fax to Shanghai . __eou__ Photograph or document ? __eou__ Document . __eou__ Show me your document , please . __eou__ Here you are . __eou__ Ah , it is clear enough to send . __eou__ How long will it take to get to Shanghai . __eou__ It'll only take a couple of minutes . __eou__ Oh , excellent . How much does it cost ? __eou__ Twenty yuan . __eou__
What would be the earliest that I could actually move into my new house ? __eou__ The keys will be turned in on Tuesday night . The house will be yours at that time . __eou__ What should we do to make sure that we have the electricity and water turned on ? __eou__ You can tell the utility company what day you are moving in , and they will transfer the utilities to your name . __eou__ There are a few things that we want to do to the place , like painting and carpet cleaning . __eou__ Take advantage of the house being empty to clean and paint . It will be harder to do after the furniture and appliances have arrived . __eou__ I asked the store to deliver my new appliances on the day we are moving in . __eou__ That will be good . You are going to want your stove and refrigerator right away . __eou__ I could use some help on moving day . What are you doing on Saturday ? __eou__ I think I am getting a fever and will be too sick to help you . Here , feel how hot my head is ! __eou__
Bob's sister will go to America . __eou__ Why tell me ? She has nothing to do with me ! __eou__ I thought you wanted to know more about her . __eou__ No , I couldn't care less ! __eou__
You are not being a good sport about this . __eou__ That's because you cheated . __eou__ I never cheat . __eou__ Yes , you do . __eou__
your mp3 looks so cool . Where did you get it ? __eou__ I bought it online . __eou__ really ? Do you often shop online ? __eou__ yes . I buy most of my daily necessities online . __eou__ I've never tried E-shopping . Is it better than shopping at an actual store ? __eou__ yes , much better . You can log in a website , browse through many items and categories comfortably at home , order the goods , pay by credit or debit card , and the goods will be delivered to your home . __eou__ sounds good , and I don't have to queue up at the cashier . __eou__ and you can still go " window shopping " just like in a real shopping mall . __eou__ well , are there any other advantages ? __eou__ yes , most of the shops are closed at 22 or even earlier , but the internet operates 24 hours a day , seven days a week , and can be accessed anywhere . __eou__ are there many choices of online shopping ? __eou__ sure . You can buy almost anything you can think of . __eou__ perhaps I should have a try . __eou__
How beautiful the flower is ! __eou__ Really , it's so beautiful . __eou__ You like it . Well , I'll gather in for you . __eou__ You mustn't pick it in this place . __eou__ Where it is ? __eou__ It's a private garden . __eou__
You look run down , Brian . __eou__ I've been feeling under the weather recently . I caught a bad cold last week , and I still haven't got over it . __eou__ Well , you wanna take a sick leave ? All you need now is a good , long rest . __eou__ I guess so . Even though I seem to be over the worst of it . I don't want to give the bug to anyone in the office . __eou__ Good idea . __eou__
Mom , what are you doing ? __eou__ I'm clipping coupons . __eou__ Still clipping coupons ? __eou__ It's a good way to save money . __eou__ Saving money ? How much money can you save by those 1 or 2 dollar discount coupons ? __eou__ How much ? Last week I save $ 10 on food . __eou__
Well , we've settled the question of price , quality and quantity . Now what about the terms of payment ? __eou__ We only accept payment by irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents . __eou__ I see . Could you make an exception and accept D / A or D / P ? __eou__ I'm afraid not . We insist on a letter of credit . __eou__ To tell you the truth , a letter of credit would increase the cost of my import . When I open a letter of credit with a bank , I have to pay a deposit . That'll tie up my money and increase my cost . __eou__ Consult your bank and see if they will reduce the required deposit to a minimum . __eou__ Still , there will be bank charges in connection with the credit . It would help me greatly if you would accept D / A or D / P . You can draw on me just as if there were a letter of credit . It makes no great difference to you , but it does to me . __eou__ Well , Mrs . Wang , you must be aware that an irrevocable letter of cred it gives the exporter the additional protection of the bank er's guarantee . We always require L / C for our exports . And the other way round , we pay by L / C for our imports . __eou__ To meet you half way , what do you say if 50 % by L / C and the balance by D / P ? __eou__ I'm very sorry , Mrs . Wang . But I'm afraid I can't promise you even that . As I've said , we require payment by L / C . __eou__
I'd like to make an appointment with Dr.Cooper.Could you arrange it for me ? __eou__ Yes.Would tomorrow morning be all right with you ? __eou__ Sorry , I've got a meeting from nine to ten.What about Monday afternoon ? __eou__ I'm afraid he's fully engaged.Could you make it another time ? __eou__
Man , I ’ m freaking out ! You gotta help me ! __eou__ Whoa , whoa , take it easy , relax . Geez , you ’ re sweating like a pig ! What ’ s going on ? __eou__ I can ’ t go through with this ! I just can ’ t ! I ’ m not ready for marriage ! What was I thinking ? I ’ m only thirty five years old ! I ’ Ve got my entire life ahead of me , adventures waiting ! I can ’ t settle down yet ! __eou__ What are you talking about ? It wasn ’ t more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family ! __eou__ I know . I know ! __eou__ Let ’ s think this through . First of all , you cannot leave Amy at the altar . Not only will she be humiliated and kill you , but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams ! Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this ? Second of all , you are just getting cold feet . You know deep down inside that you want to marry her , so cut the crap and do it ! __eou__ You ’ re right . I ’ m being crazy ! Ok , I ’ m ready , let ’ s do this ! __eou__ Great ! Phew ! That was a close one ! You had me going there for a minute I thought I was gonna have to slap some sense into you . __eou__
You voted , right ? __eou__ You know I did . __eou__ Who did you vote for ? __eou__ I voted for Obama , of course ! __eou__ Can you believe that he actually won ? __eou__ I knew he would win . __eou__ I didn ’ t think he would . __eou__ He was the top candidate . __eou__ I figured people wouldn ’ t vote for him because he ’ s African American . __eou__ That just goes to show that America is finally turning over a new leaf . __eou__ You ’ re absolutely right . __eou__ I ’ m excited that Barack Obama is our President . __eou__
Why are you arresting me ? __eou__ There is a warrant out for your arrest . __eou__ What kind of warrant ? __eou__ You have a bench warrant . __eou__ What is that ? __eou__ Have you missed a court date ? __eou__ I never went to court . __eou__ I can't help you . __eou__ This is unfair . __eou__ A lot of things aren't fair . That's life . __eou__ I have rights , don't I ? __eou__ You have the right to an attorney . __eou__
Hey Suzie . Guess what ? I'm having a baby ! __eou__ Really ? That's so great . Congratulations . __eou__ Thanks . I'm so excited . We've been trying for 8 months now . __eou__ That's really exciting . How many months are you pregnant ? __eou__ Three months . __eou__ Are you going to find out if it is a boy or a girl ? __eou__ I want to , but Bob doesn't . He wants to be surprised like the old fashioned way . __eou__ Maybe it's more exciting not knowing . __eou__ I'd rather know and buy all the baby things ahead of time . __eou__ There are so many things you have to prepare for . __eou__ I know I am going to be busy , but I know I can handle it . I have been looking forward to this day for a long long time . __eou__ It really must be an exciting time for you guys . __eou__ Thank you so much . __eou__

Our school year just ended , and a lot of Chinese are on vacation . __eou__ How long do you plan to stay ? __eou__ About half a month . __eou__ All right . Here's your passport . Welcome to Australia . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Mark . Where have you been ? I ’ Ve been calling you all morning . __eou__ I ’ Ve been playing computer games . __eou__ What ? So you blew me off yesterday and today over a stupid video game ? What game is so important that you have no time for me anymore ? What are you playing ? __eou__ It ’ s called Counter Strike.It ’ s a first person shooter game.It ’ s awesome.It ’ s a multi player game where you can go online and compete against players from all over the world . __eou__ You ’ Ve been wasting your time on this ? I can ’ t believe it ! It doesn ’ t even look fun or challenging ! __eou__ My laptop is on my bed . If you think it ’ s so easy then get on line and try to beat me . __eou__ Fine ! __eou__ Damp it ! How are you killing me with a single shot ? It ’ s not fair ! I don ’ t want to play anymore ! Let ’ s go get something to eat . __eou__ Can you bring me something ? I am totally hooked on this game ! __eou__
I need something to wash this down . Is there any juice in the fridge ? __eou__ What is that ? It looks like something from a swamp ! __eou__ It's a green drink . It's supposed to be full of vitamins and minerals . __eou__ You know , healthy eating doesn't have to make you gag . __eou__ The sales lady said that even if I eat right , I wouldn't get enough vitamins . __eou__ Have you ever tried it ? Or are you just going to believe the sales lady ? __eou__ It's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day . __eou__ It may take less time , but I don't know about easier . Yuck . __eou__
Oh , no . It looks like we're late . __eou__ Let's just sit in the back . We can still hear the service from here . __eou__ There're so many people here . Where are Rich and Cath and Taylor's parents ? __eou__ They're probably up front . The preacher's about to speak . Let's listen . __eou__ That was such a touching speech . He must have really known Taylor well . __eou__ Oh , how I wish this all wasn't happening ! __eou__
Get up as early as six o'clock only to be jammed at every crossroad and still late for work . What a life ! I've had enough of it . __eou__ Cool down , man . Everyone is fed up with the rush-hour traffic . But life isn't really all that . You should take the initiative and make some changes first . __eou__ What should I do then ? __eou__ I recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus . It may offer you many benefits . First , it's good for your health . I'm afraid it's not necessary for me to further elaborate . While lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising , a bike ride to work not only builds you up , but also makes full use of time . You might as well sleep out for a longer hour . __eou__ I know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus . After all , it's a sport . But do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty , polled air on the road ? __eou__ Well , such things are just unavoidable in a great metropolis like Beijing . I think a still more desirable benefit is psychological . Bicycling home after work can help release your stress . Life in the offices is miserable . You just sit there in a daze , gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents . Why don't you give a full play to your energy after work ? Enjoy the speed on the road . Just think , you are flashing past the poles with your own energy . How great ! __eou__
What should be put in my education background ? __eou__ You are expected to write the educational experience about your high school and college , even the time span . __eou__ What do you mean by ' job intentions ' ? __eou__ Job intentions refer to the kind of job you are eager to get , for example , accounting , marketing . __eou__
Does tea-serving follow any special etiquette in China ? Each time I dropped in at my Chinese friends ' homes , their parents would offer me a cup of hot , strong tea , though they never inquired of me about whether I want it . __eou__ You've got a point there . It is a custom and good manners to serve tea to a guest who comes to pay a visit . There is no need to ask if he needs it or not , or if he wants something else . It might be an insult to the guest if he is left sitting there without being served tea . __eou__ So the guest is presumed to be thirsty and in need of some drink after the trip . In that case , I guess , in return , the guest doesn't have to drink it if he wouldn't like it . __eou__ It wouldn't be considered rude behavior if he doesn't even take a single drop . But he'd better receive the teacup with both hands and bow his thanks when the cup is brought before his face . When the host pours hot water into his cup , he may also choose to tap his index finger on the table , meaning " Thanks " . No matter if he likes it or not , it is impolite if he doesn't even lay a finger on the cup . __eou__ So next time , I'd better take a few sips , to ' save face ' at least , right ? __eou__ Sure . The guest is welcomed by being served tea . But if after chatting for a while , the host asks servants or family members to serve a new cup of tea , or add some hot water , he is giving another signal . __eou__ What does that imply , then ? __eou__ More often than not , the understatement is ' I'm afraid it's time you leave ' . __eou__
Hey , Sandy , what's new ? Interested in a movie tonight ? __eou__ I wish I could , but I'm busy . I'm going to work at a soup kitchen tonight . __eou__ Soup kitchen ? Is that a new restaurant or something ? __eou__ Nah , it's a place where homelesspeople go to eat . __eou__ How did you get involved in something like that ? __eou__ Well , the minister at my church told us about it , and it seemed interesting . I thought I'd try it once , and if I didn't like it I'd stop . __eou__ So what do you do there ? __eou__ It's simple . All we do is prepare some food , usually sandwiches and some fruit , and give it out to them at the soup kitchen . __eou__ Yeah , it sounds easy . How long does it take ? __eou__ Only about two hours , for a couple of days a month . Why don't you give it a try ? __eou__ I don't know . I mean , I like helping the community and all that , but I don't know if I have the time ... __eou__ Come on , it's easy , and it'll make you feel good . Why don't you come with me tonight ? __eou__
How often do you service the pump ? __eou__ We take very good care of this particular pump . It's a crucial part of our process . We clean it and flush it through at the end of every shift , We check the high pressure seals , recalibrate the gauges and lubricate all moving parts weekly . We replace the gaskets every month . __eou__ How do you decide how often these things need to be done ? __eou__ Well , from experience we can predict the lifespan of different components . We try to replace components before they fail or wear out . This prevents the equipment from breaking down . It also saves us a lot of trouble ! __eou__
You did well on the math test . __eou__ Of course . __eou__ Don ’ t you always fail in the math tests ? __eou__ Things were different this time . I sat by a math genius . __eou__ Huh ? You mean you snuck a peek at his test ? __eou__ B :: Come on ! I just took a glance . __eou__ Are you crazy ? You were cheating . __eou__
I cannot understand why she always helps and supports her brother . __eou__ Why do you say so ? __eou__ Because he is often in trouble . __eou__ She has promised her mother that she would be with him through thick and thin . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__
Who's it knocking at the door ? __eou__ I think it's the postman.Will you go and open the door ? __eou__ All right . I'll get it . __eou__
Hello , are you Chinese ? __eou__ No , I'm Korean . Where are you from ? __eou__ I'm from America . Are you settling in all right ? __eou__ I've already found a flat and it's quite comfortable . What about you ? __eou__ I live in my uncle's house . He came here ten years ago . __eou__ What do you think of the local accent here ? Has it been causing you any problems ? __eou__ I think it's just a matter of getting used to it . __eou__ I can't agree more . __eou__
Have you heard the news ? __eou__ I haven't heard anything . __eou__ Deborah had her baby last week . __eou__ Nobody told me . __eou__ I thought you heard . __eou__ I really wasn't told anything . __eou__ She was a cute 8 pounds 6 ounces . __eou__ Wow , how exciting . __eou__ I know , you should really go and see her and the baby . __eou__ Of course I will . __eou__ I just wanted to let you know what happened . __eou__ I appreciate that . __eou__
Hi . I ’ m here for flight 514 returning to Beijing but the board shows there is a delay.How long of a delay is expected ? __eou__ So far it looks like we will be leaving two hours late , but keep checking the departing flights status board just in case . __eou__ Do you think it ’ s safe to leave to get a quick bite ? __eou__ I think you should stay in the airport . Even though the delay is expected to be two hours , the flight departure could be announced any minute . Who knows ? __eou__ What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ It seems there are some loose bolts on one of the wings . It happens all the time . No need to worry . __eou__ Umm ... You know ... Actually I was thinking of trying another airline . No need to hold my seat . __eou__
What do you do in your spare time ? __eou__ I have many hobbies . I like almost all kinds of sports and I also like to listen to classical music . __eou__ What kinds of sports do you like ? __eou__ I like playing basketball . Basketball is a very exciting game because it keeps you alert and I also enjoy the team spirit of basketball . __eou__ Who is your favorite author ? __eou__ I like the novels of Dickens very much . I've read almost all of them in Chinese translation . __eou__ Are you a music lover ? __eou__ Yes , I like listening to Beethoven's works . __eou__ What kinds of films do you enjoy ? __eou__ I like all kinds as long as they are exciting . __eou__
Hello , I brought a lap-top computer with me . Do you know how can I use the internet in my room ? __eou__ Well , right now , we can't afford internet use in the rooms . But you can go to the web bar in our hotel . It's on the 12 floor . __eou__ Thank you . I think I will go there . __eou__
Come in , come in , what can I do for you ? __eou__ Professor Donald , are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester ? __eou__ Yes , I am applying on it . __eou__ I wonder if I could enroll in it . I know it is a graduate course and I ' m a junior , but ... __eou__ Aren't you a bit young ? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up . __eou__ I know , but the geology of the American west is my major interest and I have done a large reading in the field . __eou__ Well , if you think you are ready , I'll let you enroll . __eou__ Oh , thanks , professor Donald . This is really very nice of you . __eou__
You don't have to play that record so loud , do you ? __eou__ I'm sorry . Has it been bothering you ? __eou__ Yes . And please ask me the next time you want to use something . __eou__ I'm sorry . I meant to ask you . __eou__

Hi , Andy . I am going to Isabel ’ s . Are you coming ? __eou__ No . The things are too expensive there for me . I can't afford it . __eou__ That is no problem at all . Isabel ’ s is having a clearance sale , and today is the last day . You don't want to miss such a good chance , do you ? __eou__ Really ? That's wonderful . Can you wait a second ? I need to change . __eou__ All right , but hurry up . It takes you hours to change . __eou__ I will . Do you think we can get something really nice and cheap ? I mean this is the last day . __eou__ I think so . They don't sell shoddy cloth for one thing . __eou__ Should we ask Cindy to come along ? She saw the evening gown made of silk last month that she wanted to buy very much . She didn't buy it of course .

Look , the hem has lowered , and the waist narrowed . __eou__ It makes me feel rather shabby . That woman has a good taste in dressing , I would say . __eou__ Yes . She dressed with an individual flair . I rather envy her . __eou__ Most women follow fashion like sheep.They don't know any better than imitate . __eou__ I quite agree with you.See the woman there ?

Doris , I'm glad you're home . I'm terrified . I don't know what to do ! __eou__ What is it ? What happened ? __eou__ I think someone is stalking me . __eou__ No , it can't be . Really ? Who ? __eou__ I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too . __eou__ Did he leave when you left ? __eou__ Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ He followed me all the way home ! __eou__ That's about five blocks . And around corners too.So he was definitely following you . __eou__ Yes , he was . I'm not imagining it.Finally , just when I got home , I turned around and looked at him.He was just standing there . He didn't smile . He just stood there . It was so obvious.What should I do ? I'm so scared . Can I call the police ? __eou__ Actually , I don't think you can call the police . Not yet at least.He hasn't done anything . And probably the police will just ignore it.But if anything happens again , then maybe you should call . __eou__ Why can't I call the police now ? He was definitely following me ! __eou__ Of course you can call the police if you want . That's not what I mean . I'm just saying that they probably won't do anything . __eou__ I suppose . What can they do ? I don't even know who he is . __eou__ Listen , Carol . Don't let this bother you too much.Probably it's nothing . Just keep your eyes open when you go out.If you see him a third time , and if he follows you again , then I think we should go to the police.But for now , just try not to worry . __eou__ Alright . And I won't go to that cafe for awhile . __eou__

Have you followed the value of dollar lately ? __eou__ How could I help but follow it ? The fluctuation of dollar is killing my company !

I would feel a lot better if the currency was a little more stable . With the way the dollar plummeting lately , my securities have gone up in smoke . __eou__ Every day I have less money ! I haven't spent anything , it is just melting away because of the shifts in exchange rate . __eou__ What we really should be making investment in is the Euro . I've followed the Euro's progress over the last quarter , I think it's about time to buy in . __eou__ What about the Yen ? __eou__ Are you kidding ? The Yen is in worse shape than the Dollar ! __eou__

OK , Ann , you spent quite a bit of time in Australia recently so why don't you talk about that ? __eou__ I really liked living in Australia . I was an international student and I studied education at the university of Sydney . And living in Sydney was fantasticbecuase I could go to the beach anytime I wanted and there was a great nightlife in Sydney . There are lots of great clubs . And people were very , very friendly and easy-going and I met a lot of international people in living Sydney . __eou__ Mm-hm . How long were you there ? __eou__ I was there for almost a year . __eou__ Oh , OK . __eou__ And I travelled a little bit in Australia . I went up the east coast . Up to Frasier Island . Which is a world heritage site . And I saw dingo running along the beach and sharks in the water . We climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the ... , which is a but north . And the further north you go in Australia , the hotter it gets . So we were able to go swimming in the ocean and I went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky cause I didn't have a diving license , so I went on an introductory dive and I saw a giant clam that had a really purple spongy inside that I was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly . __eou__ So , did you , did you lose your finger ? __eou__ Almost . __eou__ Almost . Ah , you're lucky . Um , it's funny , you go in the water and you worry about sharks , but not clams . __eou__ Exactly . __eou__ Will you be going back to Australia soon ? __eou__ I'd like to go and live there for at least another year . Probably I'll go back to Sydney or maybe I'll go down to Melbourne because it's a really interesting cultural city . They have lot of museums and parks . __eou__
In spring , people are feeling refreshed . They take off their heavy winter clothes and walk with a straight back and light steps . They feel they are full of spirits and energy . __eou__ Women in particular . They are anxious to get rid of those thick and clumsy winter suits and put on their new fashionable spring dress . __eou__ Well , when summer comes , the weather is hot and the leaves turn darkgreen ; the sun is blazing and the air is threatening . No one would like to stay in the open air for long . __eou__ That's true . In summer , the first place people want to go is a spacious room with air-conditioning or a quiet river or swimming pool . __eou__ I myself like very much to listen to the singing of some of the insects , especially the singing of cicadas . __eou__ In autumn , almost all fruits are ripe and all crops are waiting to be harvested . __eou__ And you can hear singing and laughing everywhere ! People are happy in autumn because autumn brings them harvest and richness and prosperity ! __eou__ Well , winter is a season for relaxation , do you agree with me ? __eou__ Well , it's hard to say . For the fields and rivers , winter is a relaxing season , but for farmers , I think they might take a rest physically , but mentally they are still busy thinking , planning and calculating for the working of the next year . __eou__ Maybe you are right . __eou__
How much are you planning to buy ? __eou__ Well , it's not how much , but what I'm going to buy that matters . I'm going ski shopping ! __eou__ Cool ! Can I come ? __eou__ No .

That ’ s all . __eou__ And do you know where the national bank is ? __eou__ Yes . It ’ s on this street . Keep walking for two blocks and it ’ s on the corner on the right . __eou__ Thanks very much . __eou__ You are welcome . Good luck . __eou__ Thank you . I won ’ t miss it . __eou__
Hey ! Fred , you are five minutes earlier than me today . Usually , you don't . __eou__ Hurry ! It is time for me to steal something . __eou__ What's your meaning ? __eou__ I am stealing vegetables at the Happy Farm . __eou__ You are a thief ? __eou__ No , no . I mean stealing vegetables on Internet is very popular now . Many white collars join in this game and have a lot of fun by stealing others ' vegetables . __eou__ You mean it is a still virtual game . Your friends steal your vegetables time and time again , and you take theirs as well , right ? __eou__ You got what I meant .

It's my first visit to Prague , I'll be here for three days for a conference , then I have a day on my own to do some sightseeing before I head back home . What do you suggest I see when I'm here ? __eou__ There are many interesting places you should be sure to see . One problem is transportation , however . Because the city is very old , the roads are narrow and congested . If you only have three or four days to visit , you don't want to spend them waiting in traffic in a cab . I suggest you take the subway . __eou__ The subway ? But is there a subway station next to my hotel ? I have to go between the conference center and the hotel several times a day ... __eou__ No worries , there's a subway station at the conference center itself , and a shuttle from your hotel to the conference center that takes only 5 minutes . When you do your personal sightseeing , you can first take the shuttle to the conference center , then hop on the metro . __eou__ Is it expensive to ride on the underground ? __eou__ You can get a daily pass that will allow you to travel unlimited for the whole day for about 6 dollars . Otherwise , you can pay by trip , which is about 50 cents to 2 dollars each trip , depending on how far you go . __eou__ Is it easy to get lost ? __eou__ No , no ... . it's very hard to get lost . There are two lines , one that goes in a circle , the other that is straight . If you get lost , there are always subway attendants that can help you find your way . __eou__

I usually bowl with an eight ball . I like the control of a light ball . I can spin it more , so that the ball hooks . __eou__ Well . I like them a little heavier .

Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt . __eou__ What's special about these things ? __eou__ Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled . __eou__ Thanks . I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now . __eou__
You have made a poor meal . Let me get you some more fish . __eou__ No , thanks . I have had enough . __eou__ What about some drink ? __eou__ Please bring me a cup of coffee . __eou__

Anyway , it is all worth , just think about the cool evening time . __eou__

Three nights at 500 dollars a night ... that comes to $ 1,500 . __eou__ But your brochure said that this was a package deal and the hotel ’ s services were all-inclusive . __eou__ Yes , of course . The meals and excursions were included in the hotel price . __eou__ But why are you overcharging me almost a thousand dollars ? 250 dollars a night , times three nights should just be $ 750 . __eou__ I ’ m sorry sir . The 250 - dollar rate is based on double occupancy . That means it ’ s 250 per person . The room itself is 500 dollars a night . __eou__ Perhaps I could talk to your manager ? __eou__ Of course .

Did you see the way that Brian came to work yesterday ? Ever since he came back from that conference in Silicon Valley , he's been coming to work dressed in jeans and sweatshirts . It's like he's decided to make himself at home in his office . I don't know how long it'll take before the management talks to him about it . __eou__ He was really influenced by the way they do things on the west coast . I guess the working atmosphere is a lot more relaxed and casual in California . It comes from the information technology industry .. there isn't such a large division between home and office , so people want to work in the clothes they feel more relaxed in . __eou__ Maybe so , but it seems kind of strange , which the rest of us in white shirts , dark suites , and ties . __eou__ It's not as bad as that ... We are allowed to wear more casual jackets and trousers . Besides , didn't you hear what Brian found on his desk this morning ? __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ Management decided to give him four brand new white shirts . That's their way of telling him that his new style of dressing down is not quite acceptable . __eou__

How many people live there ? __eou__ There are about 30 million people in my country . Most of them live in the north . __eou__ What ’ s the average income ? __eou__ That ’ s the really hard to say . I think most people earn about two thousand dollars a month , if you convert the money from our currency into dollars . __eou__ So your country is fairly rich . __eou__ I think we are richer than most countries , but not as rich as countries in western Europe . Our biggest problem at the moment is unemployment , which is roughly 8 % . It has doubled over the last four years . __eou__ Unemployment in my country is a fraction of that . __eou__

I like it here , but PCC is better . __eou__ So , why did you leave PCC ? __eou__ Because I got my AA and now I am going towards my bachelor degree . __eou__
What do you mean ? If he was a good programmer , he should have been raking it in . __eou__ The boss wanted to pay Bob with stock options .

They folded and he made zip . __eou__ Ouch . __eou__ Now he only works freelance . Hundred bucks an hour . __eou__

Alright everyone settle down . Let ’ s get started.As you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system . It is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . This brings me to our topic for today . Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ? __eou__ Cinct de mayo ? __eou__ No , that ’ s May fifth in Spanish , James , no wonder you are failing my Spanish class . No , May first is International Workers ’ Day . __eou__ Do we get a day off from school then ? __eou__ No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is . __eou__ Www , man ! __eou__ In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement . Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect . __eou__ Cool ! Is that why we only work eight hours now ? __eou__ Yes ! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third , 1886 , police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory , killing four and wounding many . A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality . __eou__ And then what happened ? __eou__ Well , as we say , the rest is history ... __eou__
Is there any more vodka in that bottle ? __eou__ Hum , I think there's enough for one more , yes . __eou__ Marvelous . Pass it over . My name's George , by the way . __eou__ Nice to meet you , George . I'm Irene . __eou__ So Irene , what do you do ? __eou__ I'm in computing . I work for Macrohard . __eou__ Macrohard , eh ? __eou__ What do you do ? __eou__ I have my own company that designs computer systems . __eou__
What would you want , coffee or tea ? __eou__ Bring me a cup of coffee , please . __eou__ How do you like it ? __eou__ I'd prefer a black one . __eou__
Hey Bobby . What's going on ? __eou__ Just taking a smoke break . __eou__ I forgot my cigarette today . Do you have another one ? __eou__ Sure . Here you go . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ I didn't know you smoked . __eou__ Really ? I've been smoking for over a year now . __eou__ Oh . You're new to smoking still . I've been smoking for 7 years . __eou__ You ever tried to quit ? __eou__ Many times . I'm really addicted . It's harder to stop than you think . __eou__ Yeah . I tried to quit last month , and I thought it was going to be easy , but it turns out that I'm still smoking . __eou__ I highly recommend you quit soon . The longer you smoke , the harder it becomes to quit . __eou__ I think you're right . Aright . Gotta go to class . Thanks for the cigarette . I'll talk to you later . __eou__ No problem . I'll talk to you later . __eou__

I plan to add an introductory letter behind the resume to increase the probabilities of success in the interview . __eou__ That's a good idea . Do you know how to write an introductory letter ? __eou__ I'm not sure of that . Do you know ? __eou__ I just know a little . First you need to include your basic information , such as your name , age , gender and major , etc . __eou__ Yes , I think so , too . I must introduce myself in truth . __eou__ I think the most important is that you need to show the employer that you are qualified for that job . __eou__ So I should write my strengths in the introductory letter , especially those related to the work . __eou__ Yes , thus the employer can know you very well , and then decide whether you are the right person . __eou__ You are very nice to tell me those . __eou__ I wish you good luck ! __eou__ Thank you ! __eou__
Why do you want to be a teacher ? __eou__ It's a job I've been dreaming of since I was very little .

why are you in such a good mood today ? __eou__ well , yesterday , I decided to face my fear of heights . __eou__ I didn't know you were scared of heights ! Was it really bad ? __eou__ let me put it this way . I've never seen a professional sorts game in a stadium because I could never get myself to walk to the top of the stairs to sit down . __eou__ so what did you do about it yesterday ? __eou__ I went sky-diving ! __eou__ you're kidding me ! that sounds really scary ! __eou__ It was scary , but it felt great , too . __eou__ weren't you scared ? __eou__ of course I was scared . But I had an instructor that went with me and that helped . __eou__ so have you cured your fear of heights ? __eou__ I think so . After I jumped out of the plane , I realized that I should just enjoy life . Worrying about it or not doing things out of fear is just plain silly . __eou__ I'm impressed . __eou__ are you scared of anything ? __eou__ well , sometimes I get scared when I'm in my apartment all by myself . __eou__ what do you think is going to happen ? __eou__ I always worry that the door is unlocked or that a window is open and that a stranger will come in and steal my things . __eou__ it sounds like you just need to be more careful . __eou__

The true hazel eye-and so brilliant ! Regular features , open countenance , with a complexion , Oh ! What a bloom of full health , and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure ! There is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance . One hears sometimes of a child being ' the picture of health ' ; now , she always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health . She is loveliness itself . __eou__

A guy in my office got the flu the other day . Today I seem to have come down with it , too . __eou__ Very likely . You have a slight fever . Do you have a headache , too ? __eou__ Yes . I wonder if you could do something to help me recover soon , because I'll be on a business trip in two days . __eou__ Well , you have to let your flu run its course . You must stop working and stay in bed to get plenty of rest . Usually it will take 4 to 6 days to make a full recovery . __eou__ But I'm going on a business trip in two days ! __eou__ Maybe you'll have to cancel it or postpone it . If you go out while you are sick , it won't help you recover . You may even pass your disease on to others . __eou__

I've something very unpleasant to talk with you . Upon the arrival of the first consignment , it was found that about 50 % of the sixty cases of pineapples were leaking . __eou__ It's rather an unusual case . Have you found the cause of leaking ? __eou__ It ’ s simply because the tins were damaged . __eou__ It appears to be the only case to us , that the goods have been damaged on the way . __eou__ I am sorry to say it's not on the way , but during loading . The tins inside the cases were broken evidently through rough handling . __eou__ Could you offer us a certificate issued by your Health Department ? __eou__ Certainly . Here you are . Our health authorities said they were no longer suitable for human consumption . I have to remind you that our terms are CIF Hamburg . I hope you would indemnify us for the loss , so it wouldn't be so heavy on us . __eou__ Now we are prepared to settle the issue with you amicably . __eou__
Do you mind if I smoke ? __eou__ Go right ahead . __eou__

What can I do for you , sir ? __eou__ I'd like to choose one game for myself and one for my younger sister . __eou__ What kind of games do you like ? __eou__ Big games of course . __eou__ I see , but games are played in different ways .

Then , I will take the two . __eou__ Do you want the latest editions ? If your computer runs fast , I think the latest editions are better because although old editions are cheaper , they are less exciting and attractive . __eou__ I will have the latest editions . __eou__

You just don't know what it is yet . __eou__
So how did your end-of-the-year review go ? __eou__ Oh , it was okay . I had my meeting with Mitch this morning and his bottom line is that he thinks I need to show more initiative . He thinks that I need to start being more creative . __eou__ Did he actually say that ? __eou__ Well , not in so many words . But I know that productivity is a big issue for him . Oh , he said the usual things like “ Keep up the good work ” and “ Thanks for your hard work , ” but he also said that he's thinking about bringing some employees into my department . That , to me , means he's not satisfied with what I've been doing . __eou__ Are you sure you're not reading too much into what he said ? __eou__ No , I Don't . Either I shape up or my job is on the line . __eou__ Well , I think you may be overreacting . Mitch likes to give everybody constructive criticism and I think that's what he was doing . __eou__ Do you really think so ? __eou__ Yes , I do . If you ask around , other people will tell you the same thing . __eou__ Maybe you're right . Thanks , Don . I feel better . __eou__ I'm glad to hear it . __eou__

Is there any way we could get a better warranty on this product ? __eou__ Well , I can't give you a better warranty , if you would be willing to agree to an annual contract . __eou__ That might not be ideal because there would be some drawbacks to an annual contract situation that might make it difficult to sell to our buyers . What about free delivery ? If we make a large enough order , could you waive the deliver fee ? __eou__ Yes , our delivery fee could be waived , if you make an order of 50 units or more . We would have to insist on the annual contract , however . I understand it's not the most convenient for you . Perhaps we could shorten it to a sixth month contract if you are willing to take a lower rebate . __eou__ That would be fine . We could accept a lower rebate . __eou__

What do you think about the food here ? __eou__ it's very different from Chinese food , but I am getting used to it . __eou__ Is that the Da Vinci Code that you've got there ? __eou__ yes , have you read it ? __eou__ no , but I saw the movie .

The ice there is too thin to skate on . __eou__ Got it . Thanks for reminding me . And , are there any intensive training courses ? __eou__
sorry , Brad . But you are going to have to re-do this . __eou__ What ’ s the problem , Ms . Murphy ? __eou__ It ’ s badly organized . I can ’ t present this to the board . __eou__ I ’ m sorry . Ms . Murphy . I ’ ll re-work it . Can I give it back to you this afternoon ? __eou__
I call this meeting to order . Thank you all in attendance today , I know it's a busy day for you all . We have a lot of material to cover today . Did everyone get an agenda ? __eou__ I need a copy of the agenda . Also , may I suggest something ? I know we have many points to review today , but would it be possible to limit our meeting time to finish before four o'clock ? Many of us still have a mountain of work to do before the day's end . __eou__ We should be able to finish everything up before then . Let's run through the major points first , and see where we're at . The first matter of business is to approve the minutes of our last meeting . __eou__ I propose we accept the minutes . __eou__ Good . Do I have a second ? __eou__ I second . __eou__ motion carried . Now , next on our agenda is our budget review . Margaret , can you please fill us in on where the budget review stands ? __eou__ I gave everyone a copy of the manual last week . We've had the review board going over everything , and they have come up with a final review . Here's a copy for everyone , and if you have any questions , you can talk to me after the meeting . Basically , the budget review has been completed , with maybe a few polishing details left . __eou__ What kind of action is required ? __eou__ If everyone could take a look at the final review handout , if there're any objections or corrections , let me know . Next week , we can cast the final approval . __eou__
Mr . Division , I am so sorry to have kept you waiting . __eou__ That's quite all right . __eou__ Oh dear , I forgot to bring it . __eou__ Not too worry , so tell me about yourself . __eou__
Good evening , sir . What can I do for you ? __eou__ We are going to have a party tonight , would you please look after our baby tonight ? __eou__ Well , we have baby-sitting service . We will take good care of your baby . __eou__ That's good . __eou__ Please fill out the table . __eou__
I just received a phone call for an interview next week . __eou__ Congratulations ! This is your first interview ever . __eou__ thank you , but I'm nervous . I don't know what to do.Could you tell me what should I do before an interview ? __eou__ sure , you should prepare so that you can give proper response when you're being interviewed . __eou__ yeah , besides my personal introduction , what else should I prepare ? __eou__ you should collect as much information about the company and the position you're applying for as you can . It is important to show that you've done some research into the company . The interviewers Wil __eou__ then what should I do when I'm being interviewed ? __eou__ smile at the interviewers and look them in their eyes while trying to persuade them to select you . Try to act natural , let your personality , ability and interpersonal skills shine through the interview __eou__ are there any other things I should pay attention to ? __eou__ yeah , wear formal clothes to your interview and do be punctual . That'll leave your interviewers with a good first impression . __eou__
Is Tom in ? __eou__ No , he is at work now . __eou__ May I have his office phone number please ? __eou__ Sure . It's 289,1234 . __eou__
Wow ! They've got everything here . All the world's famous brands . Aunt Cindy , what is your favorite brand ? __eou__ I love all the fashionable things . But my favorite brand is Chanel . __eou__ Oh , that's a very expensive brand , but with good reason . __eou__ Yeah . Each style is specially designed by world's top designers . So they can always make you look amazing . __eou__ I see . Come here . The high heels here look really attractive . But I wonder whether it's comfortable to wear any of them ? __eou__ Not really , especially at the beginning , if you wear high heels all day long , your feet would hurt . But , no big deal . Women can always get used to that . __eou__ It's not a simple thing to be beautiful . __eou__ Sure . But everyone loves to be beautiful . Hey , do you think this pair of sunglasses matches the handbag well ? __eou__ Yeah , very tasteful . And with them , you look even more fashionable . Oh , there are so many French perfumers . Oops , perfumes for guys ? So strange ! __eou__ Come on . Fashion is not only for women . Men also share the equal right to chase fashion . It's the new fashion for men to wear perfumes , which is called cologne . __eou__ Oh , really , that's really something new . I'm afraid not everyone can accept it . __eou__ It takes time for that . But people's consuming attitudes are changing quickly . __eou__ That's true . Well , it's obvious that fashion is not a cheap thing . So , do you spend all your money on it ? __eou__ No . Fashion is just part of my life , which improves its quality . But also , I'm good at financing . I have a credit card , but I never overdraft . __eou__ How is it that you are my mom's sis ? You two are so different . She always picks up bargains and spends more than she earns . You do so much better than her . __eou__ I have to say that's just the result of difference of our consumptive habits . __eou__
This is our rock - bottom price , Mr . Li . We can't make any further concessions . __eou__ If that's the case , there's not much point in further discussion . We might as well call the whole deal off . __eou__ What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great . __eou__ I think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price . How about meeting each other half way so that business can be concluded ? __eou__ What is your proposal ? __eou__ Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we can accept . When I suggested we meet each other half way , I meant it literally . __eou__ Do you mean to suggest that we have to make a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible . __eou__ What would you suggest ? __eou__ The best we can do will be a reduction of another 30 dollars . That'll definitely be rock bottom . __eou__ That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars to be covered . Let's meet each other half way once more , then the gap will be closed and our business completed . __eou__ You certainly have a way of talking me into it . All right , let's meet half way again . __eou__ I'm glad we've come to an agreement on price . We'll go on to the other terms and conditions at our next meeting . __eou__ Yes , there's one other point I wish to clear up . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ My friends in business circles all seem to be of the opinion that the U . S . import and export corporations have become more flexible in doing business recently . __eou__ Yes , they're right . In fact , we have either restored or adopted international practices in our foreign trade . __eou__ I'm glad to hear that . With a view to expanding and further enhancing the bilateral relations between our two parties , and in particular , exchanging timely views on specific problems in the execution and enforcement of contracts , is it possible for us to have a representative that could stay permanently in Washing - ton D . C . ? __eou__ Basically speaking , yes , we welcome the establishment of repry - tentative offices by foreign companies in Washington D . C . Of course , there are more details to be attended to . We cannot settle it in a few words . __eou__ Yes , of course . I'll call my home office tonight and let them know about it . When do we meet again ? __eou__ How about tomorrow morning at 9 ? __eou__ Good . I'll come back tomorrow , and we can then discuss it more specifically . __eou__
Mark , you are not telling me the truth . Now why ? __eou__ Promise you are not going to be angry ? __eou__ Yes , all right . So why ? Go on then . Say it . Oh , really , Mark . I promise I'm not going to be angry . Now why were you late ? __eou__ I forgot . __eou__ You forgot ? You ... __eou__ Ah , ah , you promised , and remember ? __eou__
Have you run into your cousin Jimmy lately ? __eou__ As a matter of fact , I have . I ran into him just the other day . __eou__ How's he doing ? __eou__ Not too well . He had to have four teeth pulled last week . __eou__ He did ? That's too bad ! __eou__ I think so , too . __eou__ Next time you see him , please tell him I'm thinking of him . __eou__ I'll be sure to do that . __eou__
You must know you've been scheduled to have an operation the day after __eou__ Yes . But I don't know the exact time . __eou__ The operation starts at 10 0 ' clock . But you'll get an injection of anaesthesia about 30 to 45 minutes in advance . If your family comes to see you before the operation , they should come before 8: 30 . __eou__ Oh , I see . I will tell my wife . Thank you for telling me so much . __eou__ It's nothing . Did your doctor explain to you about what operation you are going to have ? __eou__ Yes , of course . I am going to have my appendix removed . __eou__ OK . Have you signed the consent ? __eou__ Yes . Here it is . __eou__
Can I try this lipstick ? __eou__ Sure . Here is the mirror . __eou__ Well , I don't quite like the smell . __eou__ What about this one ? It's natural ingredients . __eou__ I like the color . __eou__
Hmm . Let me try something.Wait . I have a reservation for someone named Sang here . But it's spelled J - A - N - G . It's not spelled J - I - A - N - G . It's for a Mr . C Sang . __eou__ Oh , that must be me ! Probably they typed the name wrong.My husband's English isn't so good . __eou__ Yes , sometimes it happens , Ma'am . That's why it is always good to carry your confirmation number . I'm sorry about the inconvenience . __eou__ It's okay . It's probably my husband's fault.Is there a pool in this hotel ? __eou__ Yes , of course.The pool is open until 10:00 p . m . So you still have about 45 minutes . __eou__ Good . __eou__ Here is your key . Your room is 379.You can find the elevators just around that corner there , down the hall.Enjoy your stay , Ma'am . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
May I ask you a few questions about insurance ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Now we've given a CIF Shanghai price for some steel plates . What insurance rate do you suggest we should get ? __eou__ Well . Obviously , you won ’ t want All Risks cover . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Because they aren ’ t delicate goods and won ’ t likely be damaged on the voyage . FPA will be good enough . __eou__ Then am I right in understanding that FPA doesn't cover partial loss for the nature of particular average . __eou__ That's right . On the other hand , a WA policy covers you against partial loss in all cases . __eou__ Are there any other clauses in marine policies ? __eou__ Oh , lots of them . For instance , War Risks , TEND and SICC . __eou__ Well , thank you very much for all that information . Could you give me a quotation for my consignment now ? __eou__ Are you going to make an offer today ? __eou__ Yes . My customer is in urgent need of the steel plates . __eou__ Ok , I'll get this rate right away . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Good morning , Mr Wang . __eou__ Good morning . What time is it now ? __eou__ It's just nine o'clock . __eou__ I'm on time today __eou__ Yes , you're on time . Are you often late ? __eou__ Yes , quite often . __eou__ You must leave home earlier today . __eou__ No , I left home at 6:30 as usual . __eou__ Why are you so early today ? __eou__ Because the traffic is not crowded . __eou__
Hi Amy , you look very happy . __eou__ Yes , I'm very pleased . I've just got two tickets to see the Olympic opening ceremony . __eou__ Wow . You must be very excited . __eou__ I certainly am . I would have been very disappointed if I hadn ’ t got them . __eou__ Shall we go to a restaurant to celebrate ? __eou__ What a good idea . I'm quite hungry . __eou__ Me too . I feel very thirsty as well . __eou__ Let ’ s go then . __eou__
Professor , I'm concerned about my grades . Do you have a minute ? __eou__ Of course , how can I help you ? __eou__ I want to know if I am doing OK . __eou__ Let's pull out your scores so far . Do you think you are doing OK ? __eou__ I am afraid that I might not be doing all that well . __eou__ I'm seeing that you are doing OK in some areas , but not so well in others . __eou__ I think I could take better notes and read a little more . __eou__ You can greatly improve your grades by always reflecting on what you can improve on . __eou__ I'm working on it ! __eou__ Just do your best and I am sure that you will see improvement . __eou__
Hello . I'd like to change my reservation for March 19 . My name is Mary Chang . __eou__ Ah , yes , Miss Chang . What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ Well , I'd like to change the date to March 20 , and make that for two singles , not one . __eou__ Very well . That can be arranged . __eou__
How large is the plant ? __eou__ It covers an area of 75,000 square meters . __eou__ It ’ s much larger than I expected . When was the plant set up ? __eou__ In the early 70s .

We ’ re running on three shifts . __eou__ Does the plant work with everything from the raw material to the finished product ? __eou__ Our associates specializing in these fields make some access - ries . Well , here we ’ re at the production shop . Shall we start with the assembly line ? __eou__ That ’ s fine . __eou__
When's your birthday ? __eou__ It's just around the corner . __eou__
I'm too tired now . I've already worked for 12 hours overtime ! __eou__ God ! Don't you think they should get you an assistant ? __eou__ Yes , they were supposed to , but so far nobody's turned up , and I have to do the work alone . This is the first break I've had all day . __eou__ They're really running you into the ground . Why don't you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and have a good rest . __eou__ I'm afraid I can't before I finish this project . __eou__ You'd better pay more attention to your health . __eou__ I will , thanks for your concern . __eou__ You're welcome . __eou__
I know I'm a blabbermouth , but what do you think she should do , John ? __eou__ Honey , we're in the museum now . We're not here to discuss your coworker's love life . We're here to enjoy the great paintings by Picasso ! __eou__ I know ! But it's really important to her ! Her whole life could be ruined by this man ! __eou__ You're making a federal case out of it . One unhealthy love affair can't ruin anything . It could even make your life more interesting . __eou__ Are you serious , John ? __eou__ All I'm trying to say is that life is ... like ... er ... this painting . __eou__
So Chris , I've heard that you're from a big family . How many people ? __eou__ Nine total . Seven children and my parents . __eou__ Seven children ? That's a lot . Why did your parents have so many ? __eou__ Well , my mother came from a big family , and wanted to have one of her own . My father was an only child , and didn't really care about having a large family , but my mother talked him into it . __eou__ Jeez , seven children . That must have a lot of problems . We have four children in my family and my grandparents can never get our names right . __eou__ It can be hard , and there are certain sacrifices you have to make . __eou__ Like what ? I assume that there's no privacy . __eou__ That's one . Another is the lack of personal property . Everything you have , from toys to clothes , is used by your brothers and sisters . Especially clothes . Three quarters of my wardrobe are hand-me-downs . __eou__ And the age gap is also annoying . There's a ten-year difference between my younger brother and me . We have nothing in common . __eou__ Same problem here . There's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family . The last child was born just as the oldest was going to college . __eou__
Are you here for the position advertised in China Daily ? __eou__ Yes , I am . I'm very interested in that advertisement about hiring a computer program designer , and hope to know a little more about it . __eou__ What kind of information would you like ? __eou__ Well , first I would like to know if this position is still available . __eou__ Yes , it's still open . __eou__ Terrific ! Then how should I apply for ? __eou__ Oh , we need your resume , health report , three photographs and several letters of recommendation . Would you please send them to us by next Wednesday ? __eou__ Thank you very much . Bye-bye . __eou__
What kind of qualities should a secretary have ? __eou__ First , she needs to be hard-working . Second , she has to be able to do a lot ot things on her own initiative . __eou__ I am diligent and hard-working . Besides , I am good at both English and Italian . __eou__ Great . We will give you a chance to have an interview in our company . __eou__
Hi , I Want a room , please . __eou__ Good afternoon , sir . Welcome to our hotel.What kind of room would you like , sir ? __eou__ A double room for my wife and me , please . __eou__

Anything else , sir ? __eou__ Not at the moment , thank you . __eou__ Let me know if you do need anything . __eou__
It's really late but I'm starving . __eou__ Hey , that coffee shop's lights are still on . __eou__ Maybe they have some good pie . __eou__ I would love a really sticky cinnamon bun . __eou__ There was a coffee shop by my house when I was a kid that served cinnamon hot chocolate . __eou__ Mmmm . That sounds like something I had in Mexico once . __eou__ Good stuff ... Oh , no . The door is locked . __eou__ Ohhhhh ! And I just got all my juices going ! __eou__
Good morning , sir . Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I want to deposit 1000 Yuan in my bank account . __eou__ Please fill out this deposit form , first . __eou__ OK ... Here you are . Any problem on that ? __eou__ No , that's fine . Do you bring your bankbook with you ? __eou__ Yes , I do . Here it is , and the cash . __eou__ Wait a moment , please . __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Is there anything else I can do for you ? __eou__ Yes . Can you tell me what the interest rate is now ? __eou__ The deposit rate is 0.8 % every month . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
Please forgive me for rushing into your room forgetting to knock at the door . __eou__ Never mind . __eou__ I'm so sorry to disturb you so early . __eou__ It doesn't matter . __eou__ I'm dreadfully sorry . I forgot to book the tickets yesterday . __eou__ Oh , it's nothing . __eou__ I let you down . I'll make it up to you somehow . __eou__ Not a bit of it , don't blame yourself . __eou__
Any chance of using your telephone ? __eou__ You ’ Ve been using it for two weeks without paying . __eou__ Well , I thought it was not that serious . __eou__
hi , Betty.what ' s up ? __eou__ nothing special . how about you ? Are you used to the life here in the States ? __eou__ everything has been fine for the past several months . __eou__ great ! __eou__ well , I wish someone could talk to me about Western table manners __eou__ sounds interesting . Where did you get the idea ? __eou__ as you know , table manners in China are quite different from those of Westerners . __eou__ absolutely . that's because both of us have distinctive cultural features . __eou__ for example , in China , it's okay to talk while eating . However , you may regard it as rude . __eou__ yes . this must be a huge difference . __eou__ can you think of anything else ? __eou__ sure . We tend to think that the slower on eats , the more polite one seems . __eou__ I didn't know that before . __eou__ and we never sip or slurp the soup loudly . we quietly like little mouthfuls . __eou__ i got it . i'll bear it in mind . __eou__ don't worry . i'm sure our etiquette will become a natural part of your behavior as time goes by . __eou__ I hope so . __eou__
I'm here to express my congratulations to you on your birthday . And I wish you many happy returns of the day . Here is a birthday present for you . __eou__ Many thanks for your presence . __eou__
Would you like some more coffee ? __eou__ No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill . __eou__ Good luck finding the waitress ! __eou__ The service this evening has kind of sucked . Is that our server over there ? __eou__ I'll go get the check , since our server doesn't seem to be headed this way . __eou__ Good . I'll just stay here until you get back . __eou__ So the total is $ 36.00 for our dinner . __eou__ How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves ? __eou__ I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service . __eou__ I kind of feel the same way , but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight . __eou__ I think that we should leave 10 % . __eou__ $ 3.60 will be the right amount for the tip . __eou__
Is there I can do for you , miss ? __eou__ Do you know what the weather will be tomorrow ? We are planning to climb the mountain . __eou__ Let me see , oh it's a sunny day . You will have a nice trip tomorrow . __eou__ I hope so . Thank you . __eou__

Can I do that right now ? __eou__ Is this Friday okay ? __eou__ Is 6 o ’ clock Friday evening okay ? __eou__ Yes , I will schedule you for that time . __eou__ Thank you very much . See you then . __eou__
What are you doing tonight ? __eou__ I have to run to the grocery store . __eou__ Don't you hate fighting the crowds on the weekends ? __eou__ Yes , but I am out of food and milk . __eou__ What store do you shop at ? __eou__ The small one , just down the street . I like their generic brand . __eou__ I have been using the store across town for years . __eou__ I hear they have very nice stuff . __eou__ They do , but they're a little expensive on certain items . __eou__ Well , you should try my store . The prices are good . __eou__ I will sometime . Thanks for the advice . __eou__
Daniel , have you ever heard about the wildlife sanctuary ? __eou__ Is that different from this kind of zoo ? __eou__ Yes , of course . __eou__ So tell me about it ! __eou__ There are a lot of wild animals in that place , and also some special rules while visiting . __eou__ Special rules ? __eou__ There , you only have two ways for visiting . __eou__ Details ? __eou__ On their bus or in your own cars , and you won't be allowed to get off the bus until you reach the special region . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Because it is dangerous to get out of the car or bus . You can just imagine how fierce the wild animals can be . __eou__ That makes sense . But that sounds interesting . Is there one in Beijing too ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I prefer to go there next time . __eou__ Yeah , sure , you won't be disappointed . __eou__

The demographic reports are in ... From the looks of it , we're going to have to re-evaluate some of the content for our promotional events in different venues . __eou__ Why , what's the lowdown ? __eou__ According to the report , our Boston crowd is quite different make-up from our Chicago folks . Our Boston consumers are mostly from mid-level to upper-class income levels , university or postgraduates , married no children , white collar ... You know the kind . Chicago on the other hand is mostly mid to low income levels , single parent homes , blue collar ... I think we're talking about two totally different target groups . __eou__ I have no idea there was that great of deviation between the two venues ... To make our products sell , we have to take the target audience into account . __eou__ No kidding . We've got to come up with two completely different sales pitches to suit the needs of each groups . __eou__
Welcome to IBA Consumer Credit . What can I assist you with ? __eou__ My family really needs a car , we live quite far out of the town centre , but unfortunately we cannot afford to pay out such a large sum of money in one go . __eou__ That's a problem facing many young families nowadays , and we are sympathetic to the problem . That's why we have just started a new scheme ; a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan . __eou__ Great , I just hope I qualify ! Could you tell me some more ? Can I use the money to buy the car from anywhere ? __eou__ What we usually do is find a suitable car dealer for you , who offer the type of car that you need . If it's a family car that you want , we have a very reliable dealer already contracted to us . __eou__ Then I can go to this appointed dealer , see what they've got and then make a decision ? __eou__ Yes . When you have decided exactly what you want and have a purchase price we can begin to process the loan . As long as you provide the proper documentation , of course . __eou__ What do you require ? __eou__ A correctly filled in application form , ID card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment . __eou__ That sounds fine . If you could give me the name and address of the dealer I'll go over there now and see what they've got . __eou__

I have a couple of different pence , but in all it won't add up to one pound . __eou__ Are you sure the bank will change these coins for you ? __eou__ Hopefully ! __eou__

I have been with ABC Insurance Company for four years , and before that , I worked with the Pacific surveyor company as claim officer . __eou__ Could you tell me the usual procedures to handle such a case ? __eou__ Yes , on the shipper's side , when the cargos arrives , all relevant documents will be forwarded to the consignee.Among other things , this party has to check carefully the content of the packing list and weight list.When cargos are found to be damaged of short landed , this party has to call for a joint survey by representatives of the shipping company and the insurance agent.Based on the survey report , they will lodge a clam for compensation . __eou__ If you act as our representative what would you do to safeguard our interest ? __eou__ I think , first of all , I would ask the consignee to produce survey report on loading , if they can't produce that I would suggest them to refer the case to their shipper . Meanwhile , bad weather could be agood excuse to refuse the responsibility . __eou__ Are you able to operate the telex ? __eou__ Yes , I used to dispatch telex to shippers and the consignee to inform them of changes of our schedule and other information . __eou__ Now can you tell me if you have a good command of both written and spoken English ? __eou__ When I was college , I passed Band Six of College English Test.All the foreign business men I've dealt with say my English is quite good . __eou__ If you are selected for the position , you must prepare to travel overseas frequently . __eou__ No problem , I love it.Thank you for granting me the interview . __eou__

Where's your hometown ? __eou__ Shandong . __eou__

I suppose I just need to learn how to manage lecture classes . Then I will do better . __eou__
Hello , Mr . Wang . I am glad to meet you here at the fair . __eou__ Like wise . Take a seat , please . How about a cup of tea ? __eou__ Sure . Thank you . It seems your business is prosperous .

And we still have a large potential production capacity . __eou__ Well , what do you think of choosing a commission representative or agent abroad to promote your sales ? __eou__ That's a good idea . So far , we have several agents abroad . __eou__ We are willing to be your agent in Thailand for hand-held tools . What do you think ? __eou__ That sounds good . __eou__ Then , what's your usual commission rate for your agents ? __eou__ Usually , we give a commission of 4 % to our agents . __eou__ 4 % is too low , I think . You see , we have a lot of work to do in sales promotion , such as advertising on radio or TV , printing booklets , leaflets , catalogues and so on . It all costs money , 4 % is not enough . __eou__ Don't worry . We'll allow you a higher commission rate if your sales score a substantial increase . __eou__ You mean to saya __eou__ It sounds OK . Then how do you pay the commission ? __eou__ We may deduct the commission from the invoice value directly or remit it to you after payment . __eou__ All right . If it's okay , we would like to sign an agency agreement with you immediately . __eou__ Think it over . We hope to keep a good business relationship with you . __eou__ Thank you for your help . __eou__

Looking through your C . V . , I see that you graduated from Oklahoma State University . Can you tell me what training you have had that would specifically relate to the cable television Industry ? __eou__ Well , I ’ Ve attended some conferences in this field . But the most relevant training I ’ Ve had was in computer design . I believe I could integrate that knowledge with my college degree to design __eou__ I see . Did you have anything specific in mind ? __eou__ Well , I notice that you currently provide an on-screen TV Guide . At the moment , it just scrolls the names of the programs in a repeated loop . If you have many channels , you have to wait a long t __eou__ That ’ s impressive . How would you make that pay ? __eou__ Tie it in with the pay-per-view services , and perhaps it could be a money-maker . __eou__ I see you have several good ideas . Now , I just have a few questions about your C . V . I notice that there is a five-year gap between your last job and now . __eou__ Yes , I took a break from work during that time . I had a baby , and as she was born with a handicap , I decided to suspend my career . But I have continued to keep up with the Industry through con __eou__ So , you ’ re just starting back . Maybe you ’ d better tell me a little more about your experience . __eou__
I'll tell you something that's good about action movies . The special effects are great ! __eou__ But they are so silly ! They're not art ! __eou__ That's just your personal prejudice .

Where's Bill ? The ambassador is already here . The meeting is set to start at 9 am . __eou__ He's late again . Traffic is probably holding him up . You know , he commutes from the suburbs . It's not easy commuting every day . We should cut him some slack . __eou__ Even though the traffic is bumper-to-bumper out there , I don't think it's heavy traffic that makes Bill late . He takes the train , remember ? __eou__ Oh , that's right . Well , the train shouldn't be late . That means there is only one explanation ... Bill must have overslept . __eou__ Well , to be fare , since he's coming all the way from Lancaster , he's got to get up much earlier than the rest of us . He must get start on his commute about six thirty , no telling what time he actually gets up . __eou__ That's right , because he's got to get to the train station from his house , then take the blue line into the city , then switch trains to the red line . In all , the trip's got to take more than 2 hours . __eou__ Why doesn't he just drive to work ? __eou__ It's too difficult to park your car in the city . Also , the traffic coming in from the suburbs is a nightmare . __eou__
So Dick , how about getting some coffee for tonight ? __eou__ Coffee ? I don ’ t honestly like that kind of stuff . __eou__ Come on , you can at least try a little , besides your cigarette . __eou__ What ’ s wrong with that ?

I heard that janet has got a new job . She ’ s working for the united investment group . I hear that they pay very well . __eou__ I heard that too . She must be making a pocket .

By the way , did you hear that tom inherited some money recently ? __eou__ really ? I thought his parents had died several years ago . __eou__ they did . He inherited the money form an uncle . I hope he doesn ’ t lose a lot of it in taxed to the government . __eou__ dying can be very expensive nowadays ! What ’ s he going to do with it ? __eou__ he said that he would probably invest most of it . He ’ s got a well-paid job , so he doesn ’ t need the money to cover day-to day expenses . He just wants some extra money available for when he retires . __eou__ I had some good financial news yesterday too . __eou__ really ? Have you won a fortune in the lottery ? __eou__ no , but I got a pay rise of 5 % and a hours for all the hard work I ’ Ve put in recently .

That's cool . So , let me give you some details about the deck I want . __eou__ Please go ahead , I am listening . __eou__ I'd like my deck to be at the same level as the back door . __eou__ Is your back door higher than the ground level ? __eou__ Yes , the back door is about four or five steps higher than the ground . __eou__ Okay , then you need a deck with a guardrail . __eou__ I don't like things to be fancy . __eou__ Don't worry .

Sometimes I think television is too biased . None of them are completely objective . __eou__ That's unavoidable , but think , How would you keep up to date without television ? __eou__ Newspapers or the radio I guess . I just wish TV was more objective . __eou__ Look , you can still learn a lot from watching television , you just need to be smart when you're watching . Filter the information and decide if you believe what you are hearing or not . __eou__ The internet's a lot worse . __eou__ Really ? Why ? __eou__ There's no one moderating it .

A lot of people get conned online . __eou__ Again , you need to think carefully . If you don't trust others online , have nothing to do with them . __eou__

I am really exhausted , you know , I have been working without the weekend for two weeks . My boss always asks us to work overtime . __eou__ Does your boss pay you for the over-time work ? __eou__ No . But he provides free meals and sometimes gives us some small gifts . Many of us get very tired of this , and we'd rather have weekends than stay in the office . __eou__ He should know that this is against the Labor Law in our country . Legally , employees should get double pay if asked to do extra work during the weekend or on holidays . __eou__ We all know about that , but we have no choice . The chairman of the trade union says he is going to negotiate with the management . __eou__ I suggest that you go to the lawyers ' office to get some help . __eou__ That's a good idea . I think we will soon come to a solution to the problem . __eou__

I don ’ t know why I am late all the time . No one else seems to be . __eou__ That's because you don't know the short cuts . You'll learn them after a while . I can show you the ropes . __eou__

Hello , Chandler ! How are you ? __eou__ Fine . And you ? __eou__ Just so so . I am too tired . My company has been holding too many training sessions lately . __eou__ That's good .

For them but not to me . __eou__ So , what's the problem ? __eou__ We have to participate in training after a busy day and during the weekend . You know , after work all you want to do is throw yourself onto your bed . And during the Weekend , you just want to stay at home and enjoy a family dinner . __eou__ Yes , you are right .

Constant learning drive us to Sharp our power of reasoning , analysis and judgement . __eou__ Yes , I agree with you on the point but couldn't the training be held during the working day instead of weekend ? __eou__ Yes , you are right . I think weekend is the time for family gathering and rest Maybe you could make that suggestion to your boss . __eou__

I'll give a try . __eou__ Are you feeling better now ? Do you need some pills ? __eou__ Much better . Thank you .

The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest . __eou__ Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? The same is true in the West . __eou__ No , absolutely not ! On the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . But always pay attention to what you say . If the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested . __eou__ You mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? That goes in like with Confucius ' preachings , right ? __eou__ Correct . Show respect for the older people . Conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other . __eou__ Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ? __eou__ Yes , plenty of them . Don't eat fast ! People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely . __eou__ Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ? __eou__ Haha , I'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate . __eou__

Tiffany , why are more and more people turning to the Web to find a mate ? __eou__ I think that , as more people use the Internet for both work and pleasure , it makes more sense as a tool to connect with people , and the stigma of meeting someone online is reduced . __eou__ There are actually special sites for people looking to date within their specific ethnic group and age group . But how should you screen potential mates ? Do you suggest talking to them on the phone right away or communicating via e-mail ? __eou__ I would say do not make the e-mail exchange too long . A lot of times a connection via e-mail creates almost a false sense of intimacy . Quickly make sure there is a connection in the physical world . __eou__ Can you give us any other safety tips for people pursuing relationships on the Net ? __eou__ I'd suggest you not give out too much personal information , like your home address , until after several dates . Just keep up the same guards you would keep up if you were meeting any stranger . __eou__ Besides the growth of these matchmaker sites , do you have any stats on success rates ? Are people out there finding true and lasting love through the Internet __eou__ Well , for a site like ecrush.com , since their debut in Valentine's Day in 1999 , of the 1.5 million people who have joined ecrush.com , 300000 have actually matched . __eou__ Do you have any successful stories to share ? __eou__ Yes , the couple that I highlighted at today's show met on Match.com and they're getting married this summer . __eou__

And then ? __eou__ If you have interest in butterflies , you must go to the Butterfly Exhibition . Mr . Chen , owner of the private museum , has a large collection of specimen of over 1 000 species of butterflies from more than 20 countries for public display . Quite a lot of them are state-level treasures . __eou__ Mr . Chen himself has become an authority in this area , and master of butterfly sample making , I should say . __eou__

I am not quite sure which one I will buy . __eou__ Ok . Here are the ones , turtleneck pullover , crewneck pullover , V-neck pullover and cowl-neck pullover . __eou__
Is this seat taken ? __eou__ No . Have a seat . __eou__
Hey , Terry , have all the players got here ? __eou__ Yeah , most of them have arrived . Don't worry . There are still 20 minutes left before the match . __eou__ OK . By the way , the stadium is terrific . __eou__ Of course . It's a newly-built one . __eou__ We are lucky to play in a new stadium . __eou__ Hurry up , Benjamin ! Pass the ball to me . I'm good at shooting . __eou__ Look out . Catch the ball . You should dunk besides the three-point line . __eou__ Oh , God ! I didn't touch anybody . How can I commit a foul ? __eou__ Just calm down . It's just a turnover . Make up your mind and we can shoot well . __eou__ Yes , I got it . Come on , Benjamin , don't let him get into the paint . __eou__ No problem , I once played a 2 - meter-high player successfully . __eou__ Really ? You must be ... __eou__ But that game he dunked over me for 13 times . __eou__ That's interesting . Let's hurry up , we should beat them in the first half . __eou__ Oh , look , what's happened to Jack ? He sat down . __eou__ He may be injured . Yes , come on , call the team doctor . __eou__
are you working overtime again ? Over the last two weeks , you have worked overtime every day without a break ! Your company is draining the life out of you ! __eou__ I know , but I don't have a choice , my boss has complete control over our work schedules . I haven't made it out of the office before 9 PM a single day this week . __eou__ Well , I hope they're paying you the big bucks for all this work ... __eou__ No , not exactly , I'm working for minimum wage.And they don't give extra pay for overtime . Overtime is our own time . __eou__ What ? ! Isn't there a law against that , I think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages . You should know your rights ! If you are putting in so many hours , they should give you some kind of compensation . __eou__ They do give bonuses at the end of the year for the employees with highest productivity numbers , but frankly , it's not much of an incentive . They give us a bonus of ten dollars . __eou__ That's just wrong ! why don't you just quit ? __eou__ I would , but I'm afraid I would't be able to find another job . I don't have very many job marketable skills , there aren't so many jobs that I'm qualified for . __eou__ it sounds like any job will be better than the one you have now ! __eou__
Why are you so crazy about bird-watching ? What do you get out of it ? __eou__ Looking at the beautiful creatures and listening to their songs are such wonderful experiences . I feel as if I'm in direct contact with nature . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ You bet . You should try it yourself . __eou__
What do you think is harder , reading or writing ? __eou__ Well , they ’ re completely different . Reading is passive , and writing is active . __eou__ I don ’ t think I understand what you mean . Could you explain a little more ? __eou__ In reading you need to recognize language by seeing the words on the page and knowing what they are . In writing you have to produce language , you have to create your own words on a blank page . __eou__ Oh , now I see what you mean . When you ’ re reading , you are just looking , but when you are writing , you are actually doing something ! __eou__ A reading knowledge of a language is larger and different from a writing knowledge . Don ’ t you think so ? __eou__ I think I see what you mean . I can read Shakespeare but I definitely can ’ t write it . __eou__ Exactly . __eou__ So I have another question for you . What do you think is harder , speaking or understanding ? __eou__ They ’ re both harder than reading or writing . __eou__ In what way ? __eou__ Because they are direct communication with another person , and there ’ s a time limit . This time limit is the most serious problem for foreigners , even for those who know lots of English . __eou__ You are making me feel really discouraged . __eou__ I ’ m not trying to discourage you . I ’ m trying to help you . You have to live with these difficulties . Isn ’ t it better to know about them ? The more you know about what you have to face , the better you ’ ll do . I promise ! __eou__
Excuse me , do you know where the Post Office is ? __eou__ Yes , it's not very far from here . Follow this road until you get to the traffic lights . You will see a small restaurant at the corner . __eou__ Is the restaurant on the right or on the left hand side of the road ? __eou__ It is on the right . But it is on the other side of the lights . __eou__ OK . Do I turn on the lights or do I go straight ? __eou__ You go straight on at the lights , but just past the restaurant building there is a small road to your right . __eou__ And do I take that road ? __eou__ Yes , you need to turn right and follow that road for about four minutes . You will see the Post Office on your left . __eou__ Is there a Post Office sign on the building ? __eou__ Yes and it is quite a big building so you won't miss it . There is also a small supermarket next to it . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ You're welcome . __eou__
Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ? __eou__ I'm Bill . I'm in Room 908 . Can you change the room for me ? It's too noisy . My wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . She said it was too much for her . __eou__ I'm awfully sorry , sir . I do apologize . Room 908 is at the end of the corridor . It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when all is quiet . __eou__ Anyhow , I'd like to change our room . __eou__ No problem , sir . We'll manage it , but we don't have any spare room today . Could you wait till tomorrow ? The American People-to-people Education Delegation will be leaving tomorrow morning . There'll be some rooms for you to choose from . __eou__ All right . I hope we'll be able to enjoy our stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep . __eou__ Be sure . I'll make a note of that . Everything will be taken care of . And if there is anything more you need , please let us know . __eou__
Did you hear what's going on downtown today ? All the orders from the factory are staging a demonstration in the streets . Not one of the two thousand employees showed up for work today , and they have gathered outside the city hall to demand better working conditions for all factory employees . __eou__ Wow , sounds chaotic ... two thousand people in the streets carrying picket signs and shouting slogans . What gave them the motivation to finally organize and call management on the substandard working conditions ? __eou__ I think they gained courage after the mayor's speech last week on equality and opportunity for all town citizens . Anyway , the sentiments have been brewing for quite some time . I mean , we all know the working conditions at the factory are quite horrendous . __eou__ So what kind of demands do they have ? What are they asking for specifically ? __eou__ They want raises and medical insurance , and I think they want to clean up the factory's safety hazards . That's probably the most important issue . __eou__
I believe we ' Ve met before . My name's David . __eou__ Yes , at your company , I think . I'm Frank . __eou__ Oh , I remember now.Very nice to meet you again . __eou__ Nice meeting you , too . __eou__
I need help preparing for my presentation on Friday . __eou__ I could help you with that . __eou__ Are you sure you have the time ? __eou__ I promise you that I have the time to do this . If I didn't , I wouldn't offer to help . __eou__ What would be the best time for you to help me ? __eou__ Tomorrow night would work for me . __eou__ Should we just meet here ? __eou__ OK , and I'll bring some information that helped me with my presentation . __eou__ I'll see you then . __eou__ See you tomorrow night . __eou__
Look ! The girl is so beautiful and she is smiling at me . She is lovely . __eou__ I can't agree with you . She's pretty , but she always blows hot and cold . __eou__ What makes you think so ? __eou__ She's my sister , you know . __eou__
Who's that ? __eou__ Saint Jude-he's the saint of lost causes . Like my cousin , Anna , who can't stop getting pregnant . She's a lost cause . __eou__ Is that your cousin in the back ? __eou__ Yep . She's always got a bun in the oven . She was pregnant before marriage-a real sin in the Catholic Church . __eou__ What about birth control pills ? Don't they work on Italians ? __eou__ Ha-ha . Birth control and abortion are four-letter words in my family . __eou__ And I heard that Italian men have very active libidos . __eou__
I'm calling about you appointment.Mr.Smith has to cancel all his appointments because he's got something urgent to attend to . __eou__ When can I go to see him ? __eou__ Anytime except today.Please give him a call before you come . __eou__ OK . __eou__
Would you like to mail it by air or sea ? __eou__ Hmm ... How long will it take to mail things to the USA by air ? __eou__ About 10 days . You can send it express mail if you need it faster . It will only take three or four days . __eou__ I want to send it by express mail . The faster , the better . __eou__ OK , the postage is 275 yuan . __eou__ Here you go . __eou__ This is the receipt , please keep it . Have a good day . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
Mary didn't pass the final exam in physics . __eou__ She must be very sad . __eou__ Her parents scolded her severely and she's very depressed now . __eou__ At a time like this , what she needs is a pat on the back rather than a blame . __eou__
Hey Joe , how have you been ? __eou__ I am doing well . How about you , Mary ? __eou__ I am doing OK , Joe . __eou__ There is a new movie at the mall that I want to see . Want to go with me ? __eou__ I can't because I already promised my roommate that I would go shopping with her . __eou__ I could go to the movies on Friday night instead . Would that be better ? __eou__ Did you have a certain movie in mind ? __eou__ I thought the movie about a serial killer who rapes and mutilates his victims would be a good choice . __eou__ I kind of wanted to see “ The Secret Life of Bees . ” __eou__ Maybe we can think of something somewhere between a chick flick and a horror movie ! __eou__
Why are you so rude to your wife ? __eou__ I didn't like her butting in where I didn't want her . She's a chatter box . __eou__ But she means to help you , not to trouble you . __eou__ I know . But I just can't stand her butting in when I was trying to emphasize a point . __eou__

You're right ! This refrigerator is great . I'll take it . __eou__
I'm a little rushed . Is there any quicker way to get there ? __eou__ Yeah , of course . You can take a taxi . __eou__ How much will that run me ? __eou__ It depends on traffic and distance , but it is reasonable . __eou__ Do the drivers speak English ? __eou__ Some are better than others . But , you shouldn't have a problem . __eou__ Are they safe ? __eou__ For the most part , yes . If you don't feel comfortable with it , then it is best not to take one at night . __eou__
Hi Jane , can you let me know the best way to get to your house this evening ? __eou__ Certainly , where will you be coming from ? __eou__ I need to be in the city centre this afternoon so I will be coming straight from there . __eou__ Ok .

Make sure you take the High Street Kensington exit . __eou__ Got that . __eou__ Ok - when you leave the Underground , cross the road and you should see Horntown Street . Was up that street to the crossroads . As you was you should see a fast food place on your right . __eou__ Hold on , I am looking at the map now . Ok , I can see Horntown Road . Do I go straight at the intersection ? __eou__ No , you need to turn left into Philimore Was and take the next right . __eou__ Ok , I can see that road . __eou__ That's fine .

Will we see you around 7 pm ? __eou__ That's great , see you at seven . __eou__

You know how I know ? __eou__ How ? __eou__ Because I won't let it fail . __eou__ But what about tomorrow ? What if Stars.com decides to go with WebTracker , and not us ? __eou__
