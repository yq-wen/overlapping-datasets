Look , there's no way we can convince people they need fresh motor oil every morning . __eou__ No , but you can let them know that yours is the cream of the crop-the purest motor oil in the world .

Why can't people just stick to plain and simple coffee ? __eou__ That's just the point ! Purity is the essence of good coffee , right ? __eou__
So , got any more ideas for the website ? __eou__ Well , since we're collecting gifts instead of red envelopes , I made a " for guests only " gift chat room . __eou__ But we registered at Macy's . People can just buy gifts there . __eou__ The Taiwanese won't have time to buy gifts in America . The chat room is more convenient . __eou__ You're right . They can discuss what to get and avoid buying the same things . __eou__ Or discuss what gifts they could buy together . __eou__ Any other ideas ? __eou__ We can also put a guest book on the website for people to sign and write comments . __eou__ And we were going to make a collage for each of us using our baby pictures ... __eou__ Yeah , that will be the best part . Jack hasn't seen yours yet , right ? __eou__ No . He has no idea what a fat little pig I was ! __eou__
Besides , yours don't have side pockets like mine . __eou__ Cool ! They're big !

That's incredible ! __eou__ Maybe . But you'd be amazed at how little's left after the credit companies have deducted their share from my account . __eou__ Hey , I know what that's like .

I want to burn up my fat . __eou__ But running so fast is not good for people over forties . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ We are not as athletic as we were when young . Mild exercise is more suitable for us . __eou__ But I want to burn up more calories ! __eou__ In fact , in order to burn up your fat , you must take it slowly for a longer time . __eou__ Really ? I will slow down then . __eou__

They have a philately counter where he can buy stamps for his collection . __eou__ Do you think that the service at post offices has improved ? __eou__ I think it ’ s better for some things , like sending and receiving money , but if you need to post something it sometimes takes longer than it used to . __eou__ I like being able to buy newspapers and magazines at the post office . It means that I don ’ t need to go to two places __eou__

We can do business directly with the corporation . As I mentioned before , the Chinese government is trying very hard to perfect its law . Its commercial legislation provides legal protection for foreign companies . __eou__ Well , it's known that the Sino-American relation is in a dilemma . Does it influence your business in China ? __eou__ Actually not at present . But we are afraid it will . You know policies influence business to some extent .

I love you so much and I really believe in our love . __eou__

It's in one of the poshest areas in this area . __eou__ Is he living in the new housing estate in Killington ? __eou__ No , he's living in an old house in Warton . __eou__ Do you mean the one near the health centre on Old Slate Road ? __eou__ That's the one . __eou__ His house must be worth millions !

It must be difficult being him . __eou__ You can say that again . __eou__
He's only interested in harassing you . How can he expect us to have so much time to waste ? __eou__ I almost want to send him a virus to shut his stupid computer down . __eou__ As obnoxious as Bean is , we should still try to finish this case . __eou__ True-well , do you have any forwards for me to send him ? __eou__ Yeah ! Remember that one about putting light bulbs in your mouth ? __eou__
Walter , did you email that document to Mr . Lin yesterday ? __eou__ Yes , I did , Ms . Chen . __eou__ That's strange . I have Mr . Lin on the phone right now , and he says that he didn't receive any email from us yesterday . Are you sure you sent it ? __eou__ I'm positive , Ms . Chen . __eou__

Looking through your C . V . , I see that you graduated from Oklahoma State University . Can you tell me what training you have had that would specifically relate to the cable television Industry ? __eou__ Well , I ’ Ve attended some conferences in this field . But the most relevant training I ’ Ve had was in computer design . I believe I could integrate that knowledge with my college degree to design __eou__ I see . Did you have anything specific in mind ? __eou__ Well , I notice that you currently provide an on-screen TV Guide . At the moment , it just scrolls the names of the programs in a repeated loop . If you have many channels , you have to wait a long t __eou__ That ’ s impressive . How would you make that pay ? __eou__ Tie it in with the pay-per-view services , and perhaps it could be a money-maker . __eou__ I see you have several good ideas . Now , I just have a few questions about your C . V . I notice that there is a five-year gap between your last job and now . __eou__ Yes , I took a break from work during that time .

Today people are hearing about information superhighways and the intermet . __eou__ Is this change going to be beneficial for theindividuals like you and me . __eou__ Yes , I think so . My friend once used it mostly to play chess , but now he has learnt how to do other things on the Internet . __eou__ There's no doubt the Internet will be a powerful commercial medium . It'll connect hundreds of millions of customers and open up huge markets for all kinds of products and services . __eou__ That's true . I can imagine companies sending advertisements directly to customers over the net . Customers , in turn , can examine and compare whatever goods they want to buy and tell their computers to find them at the best price offered . __eou__ Yeah . It'll be a shoppers heaven . That's the use of net in E-commerce . __eou__
Did you get the car you wanted ? __eou__ No . Someone had stolen a march on me and bought it . __eou__ What about the car over there ? __eou__ It is marvelous , and the price is marvelous , as well . __eou__

Did your company go union ? I heard that many companies in out industry are being unionized , so It's getting harder and harder to compete on a level playing field . __eou__ Yes , we're hopping on the bandwagon and signing up for the union . Mostly people are pretty happy about it ... I guess it depends on if you are in management or in the labor force . __eou__ Management isn't looking on the labor unions too favorably , I'd guess . I don't blame them ... labor unions can really put the squeeze on the executives . __eou__ Sure ... but it's probably better for the workers , because the union's whole purpose is to look out for the little guys . The only way that the little guys can take on the big bosses is if they unite . Labor unions are all about getting a voice for the underdog . __eou__
Could you hold the elevator , please ? Thanks a lot . __eou__ No problem . What floor ? __eou__ I'm headed to the 18th floor , the top floor . __eou__ Oh , so am I . __eou__ Do you work there ? I have an interview today with Dale Mendoza . Do you know her ? __eou__ Yeah , I know her pretty well . __eou__ To tell you the truth , I'm really nervous . I had a dream last night that I was being interviewed by a three-headed monster that kept trying to bite my head off . Oh , wow , my palms are sweaty just thinking about it . I just hope Ms . Mendoza won't be able to hear my teeth chattering . I just hope I get through this in one piece . __eou__

In some parts of America , the day can be - 10 ° C and sunny . __eou__
I think mum should not take sides . After all , we are all her children . __eou__ But our younger sister is the apple of her eye . __eou__ It ’ s unfair . __eou__ Well , we can do nothing about it . __eou__
I seldom heard the quarreling of her children . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ Because her children have been the age when they seem to quarrel all day long . __eou__ Oh , I see . She told me that she had learned very quickly how to pour oil on troubled waters , but not to pour oil on the flame . __eou__ She is a clever mother . __eou__
How is grandpa doing recently ? __eou__ Not good . The doctor told him not to smoke again , but it just rolls off him like water off the duck ’ s back ! __eou__ Maybe I would talk with him someday . __eou__ I hope it will be of some use . __eou__

Do you know that Mary an Ben have already separated ? __eou__ Yeah , I know . __eou__ I didn ’ t know it until yesterday . I put my foot into it , and was even stupid enough to ask when they would get married . __eou__
Don't you feel a little strange taking the place of your old boss after he was demoted ? __eou__ Yes , at first I felt very awkward . After Bill was demoted and then resigned , it was kind of like somebody died ! I mean the atmosphere in the office was like a funeral parlor or something . And then I was afraid people would look at me as a traitor for filling in his spot when the management asked me to ... __eou__ Did they mutiny ? __eou__ Thankful , no . I guess everyone understands the opportunity I had to step into a leadership role is so great for my career . I'm really moving up the ladder now that I'm considered a supervisor . After a couple weeks , it was like nothing happened . __eou__ It is a really good chance for you to get more exposure at work . supervisors get to take the credit for all the hard work of the people under them . __eou__ Yeah , and they also take the blame , that's what happened to my old boss ... __eou__

Come in , please ! __eou__ Yes . __eou__ This way please . Your room is upstairs ... Here it is . __eou__ Wonderful ! A modest , comfortable room . Ah , a beautiful window , through which I can see a beautiful scene , and hear the birds singing . How nice ! __eou__ Yes , if you want to wash something , there is a separate lavatory room outside . __eou__ Excellent ! I like it ! When can I move in ? __eou__ Anytime you like . __eou__ OK . __eou__

So how did you meet Bill ? __eou__ I met him through a computer bulletin board . __eou__ Oh , really ? Which bulletin board ? __eou__ It was one I used down at the local coffee house called the San Francisco Net . It's been around since around 1991 . __eou__ I've heard about that , but I've never tried it . __eou__ You ought to . One dollar buys you 15 minutes of computer time . A Chat session links you with cappuccino sippers in other cafes and also to home computers on the network . __eou__ I have no desire to talk on a network with a bunch of strangers . __eou__ That's the whole point . All your inhibitions disappear because you can ’ t see the other person . This network allows you to talk to people whom you normally wouldn ’ t talk to . __eou__ I just want a private conversation with one other person . __eou__ You can do that . A private session lets two people talk alone . This techno-chat program lets you talk about anything with everybody , without prejudice because you can ’ t see them . __eou__ Well , maybe I'll tag along and watch how you talk . __eou__ That's fine with me , but we'll have to get there early . Because after 8 pm , there is always a long line . __eou__ It ’ s that popular ? __eou__ It sure is . __eou__
Wow ! You look like a drowned rat ! Didn't you know there is a thunder-storm today ? __eou__ I knew there would be a shower , but I didn't realize it would rain cats and dogs today . __eou__ Well .

That ’ ll be 80 bucks . __eou__ Wait ... What ! __eou__
Did you see the woman that just left my office ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ She's another applicant , and a leading contender , but I didn ’ t want to hire her . She ’ s qualified , but she doesn ’ t quite fit the profile . We ’ re looking for an accountant , and part of the job requires interacting with clients . Well , our clients want conservative people to handle their money . And green hair with ripped jeans doesn ’ t exactly fill them with trust . __eou__ But it's the style now . __eou__ I realize that , but our business is serving clients and giving them what they want . __eou__ Of course . __eou__ Well , they don ’ t want to deal with people who look like that . They want people who look more like yourself . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ Well , they ’ re older , and they don ’ t understand today's fashions . When they see someone dressed like that , warning bells go off . They don ’ t like that style at all , and they don ’ t like dealing with people who dress like that at work . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__ We used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good , very good . But , the clients reacted very negatively when they saw her . Some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively . __eou__ What happened to her ? __eou__ Well , she was a very good employee and we wanted to keep her , so her supervisor called her in for a chat and laid it on the line for her . She got the idea and now she saves the trendy styles for evenings and weekends . __eou__ I see . __eou__
What kind of character do you think you have ? __eou__ Generally speaking , l am an open-minded person . __eou__ What is your strongest trait ? __eou__ Cheerfulness and friendliness . __eou__ How would your friends or colleagues describe you ? __eou__ They say Mr . Sun is a friendly , sensitive , caring and determined person . __eou__ What personality do you admire ? __eou__ I admire a person who is honest , flexible and easy-going . __eou__ How do you get along with others ? __eou__ I get on well with others . __eou__
Is English acceptable for you ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ What's your name ? __eou__ Jenny Madison . __eou__ What ’ s your nationality ? __eou__ Nigerian . __eou__ What is your date of birth ? __eou__ 15th of April , 1969 . __eou__ And your occupation ? __eou__ I am a painter . __eou__ What's your passport No . ? __eou__ 7834623464 3367 . __eou__ Where do you live in China ? __eou__ In the Golden Mountain Hotel in Beijing . __eou__ You are suspected of smuggling . Do you understand your rights ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Ok , sign here . __eou__
I wish to make it clear at the outset that this matter of labels is entirely our problem . __eou__ I should say it is something we have never come across before . __eou__ The Federal Food and Drug Administration , or the FDA as we call it for short , imposes a whole set of regulations on the import of food products to the United States . Over the years , they have become so rigid and complicated that they are now quite a head - ache for us importers . __eou__ In my opinion , overly strict regulations are just another way of restricting imports . __eou__ Ah , there's something in what you're saying . According to the present FDA regulations , the Ma Ling Labels then cannot be used if the lichee is to be offered for import into the United States . __eou__ Why not ? Our cannedlichee and canned provisions have already been widely sold in various markets abroad , and the Ma Ling Label has now been accepted by most of overseas customers and importers . Is it quite impossible for you to use the Ma Ling labels as they are ? __eou__ I'd be quite willing to if I could , but we must comply with the label requirements according to our law , or we can't clear the consignment of lichee through the Customs . __eou__ In that case , what can we do to help you ? Have you any suggestions ? __eou__ Would you consider quoting us for the order with neutral cans on a C . I . F . basis for delivery in Hong Kong ? Our associated company there will have the labels printed to comply with the FDA regulations . __eou__ Do you think that's the only way out ? You know we usually do the labeling , as we are responsible for the brand labels of our products . __eou__
What happened to that girl you were seeing ? __eou__ Oh Jackie ? We broke up last week . __eou__ That was a short relationship . You only started dating 2 months ago . __eou__ It was actually a long two months . She was a psycho . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ She would be laughing one moment , and if I said something insensitive , she would start crying . I didn't want to deal with that . __eou__ She sounds very emotional . __eou__ She was a psycho , man . One time we were suppose to get together . I was waiting for her call , and when she finally called , she was screaming why I wasn't at her place . __eou__ Were you suppose to be there ? __eou__ I thought she was going to call when she was done shopping . It was a misunderstanding . She was literally screaming on the phone over this . __eou__ Ok . You're right . She's a psycho . __eou__ I'm just glad it's over . __eou__
Fair-Priced Fares , how may I help you ? __eou__ How much is a round-trip ticket to London ? __eou__ When did you plan to go , sir ? __eou__ In the second week of September . __eou__ The second week of September is still in the high-season , so the cheapest tickets are $ 650 . The high season lasts until the 15th , so fares after that date are cheaper . __eou__ In that case , I'll go after the 15th . How much are the off-season fares ? __eou__ Our cheapest ticket is $ 550 on American Airlines . __eou__ Okay , I'll take it . ( to be continued ) __eou__
Ahhchooo ! __eou__ You've been sneezing a lot lately . Are you sick or something ? __eou__ No . Every spring time around April , I'm stricken with allergies . __eou__ I never have seasonal allergies . __eou__ Consider yourself lucky . __eou__ What are all the symptoms ? __eou__ Well , as you just saw , I sneeze a lot . Also , my nose becomes very runny , my throat sometimes itches , and my eyes start to water . __eou__ That doesn't sound good . __eou__ No , it's not . So you don't have any type of allergies ? __eou__ Well , I have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol . It runs in the family . __eou__ Everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol . __eou__ I get it pretty bad . My whole face turns red , including my ears . My eyes become bloodshot , and I start to itch all over my body . __eou__ That's pretty bad . __eou__ But that doesn't stop me from drinking . Ahahah . __eou__
Professor wang can I ask a few questions ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__ What is the tariff ? __eou__ It's a tax levy by the goveroverment on goods imported into that country . __eou__ Why does the government levy the tariff ? __eou__ Tariff provides the government with extra tax revenue . __eou__ Anything else . __eou__ Tariff raises the price at which the goods are sold in the importing country and therefore makes them less competitive with locally produced goods . __eou__ Oh , I know . Thank you . Professor wang . __eou__ Do not mention it . __eou__
A report says running red lights causes one thousand traffic accidents every year . __eou__ It ’ s horrible . Why do drivers run a red light then ? __eou__ Maybe they know they shouldn ’ t run a red light , but when they are driving they don ’ t pay enough attention to traffic lights . __eou__ Talking on the cell phone while driving is very dangerous too . It increases the chance of accidents . __eou__ I know . If a policeman catches you using the cell phone while driving , you will be fined . __eou__
Johnny , are you just sitting around again ? __eou__ I'm just taking a break between washing the windows and cleaning the toilet . __eou__ I'd say all you've done is moved the dirt from the windows on to your face and hands . Disgraceful ! __eou__ I'm doing my best , Grandma ... __eou__ Your best isn't good enough . Back in my day , I'd clean a whole hospital with a toothbrush and spit , and it'd be twice as clean as this sty ! __eou__ Uh-oh , here we go ... __eou__
You seem really ticked off . What's up ? __eou__ Just get out of my face , would you ? __eou__ Chill out ! What's eating you , anyway ? __eou__ Sorry . I'm just that I think I blew the final and now my parents are going to get all bent out of shape . I like totally drew a blank on everything ! __eou__ Well , now you're really going to freak out when I tell you who aced it ... what's-her-face ... the one who always kisses up to the teacher . __eou__ Jennifer Davies ? Give me a break ! I can't stand her . She's such a dweeb ! How could she possibly ace it when she keeps cutting class all the time ? __eou__ She's the teacher's pet , that's why . Besides , he's so laid back he lets her get away with it . She just really rubs me the wrong way . And you know what ? I think she's got the hots for him , too . __eou__ Get out of here ! __eou__ I'm dead serious . Yesterday , before class starts , she walks up to Mr - Edward's desk and goes , ‘ Good morning , Jim . ’ __eou__ Oh , gag me ! She's totally gross ! __eou__
It may comfort you to know that many people attended his viewing . __eou__ How did they hear ? No one called . __eou__ In times of loss , it is often hard to pick up the phone .

He was their only son . __eou__ And he was so young , with so much life to look forward to . __eou__ Yes ... thank you for understanding . We have to go now . __eou__ This sheet tells the visiting hours and funeral time and location . __eou__

Perhaps next time , I ’ ll be luckier and win the jackpot ! __eou__

This zoo was built in 1862 , and it's the oldest zoo in the world , and still among the best . There are more than 3,000 species of animals here , including the popular kangaroos , wallabies , koalas , and wombats . __eou__ Are the animals caged ? __eou__ Most animals are not locked up in tiny cages .

Miss , may I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I just wondered why the price between the ninth and tenth floor is so different . __eou__ It's because of the view . __eou__ Oh ! I see . Can you show me the location of Block I ? __eou__ Sure . Please take a look at the model of the building . Nice Garden has a total of two blocks which are labeled Block I and Block II .

How's your time spent in the United States ? __eou__ Well , pretty good . __eou__ I'm glad to hear that . What impressed you most ? __eou__ Well , the cultural differences impressed me most . __eou__ You mean we Chinese think differently from the Americans ? __eou__ That's right , quite different . One day one of my American friend looked pale , so I asked him whether he was sick or not . But he was reluctant to answer my question . __eou__ That's weird . __eou__ And what's more , when he told me he had caught a cold for several days , I suggested him to go to the hospital as soon as possible . __eou__ You really cared about your friend . __eou__ Sure I am . But he responded by saying'what do you mean ? ' . __eou__ I'm confused . Why did he say that ? __eou__ I felt the same at first . Later he told me that I'd better not give him any suggestions when he was sick . Offering unsolicited help or advice is like showing sympathy to the weak or the poor . But back in China , helping others is always regarded being kind . __eou__ Absolutely . Now I understand why he responded that way . __eou__
I've heard so much about Japan . Is it a beautiful country ? __eou__ Not everyone thinks Japan is beautiful , but to me its beauty is breathtaking.You feel the same way about France , don't you ? __eou__ Yes , I do feel the same way about France .

France isn't an island , is it ? __eou__ Oh , no , France isn't an island . It is located in the western part of the European continent . But France does have many fine harbors and port cities on its southern and western coasts . Does Japan have good harbors ? __eou__ Good harbors ! Yokohama is one of the most famous port cities in the world , and Japan is the largest shipbuilding nation in the world . Also , there are long mountain ranges in the southern is hands .

What kind of Climate does Japan have ? __eou__ The Japanese climate is warm and moist in the south , mild in the central part and cold in the north . Except for Hokkaido , we don't get much snowfall at all . France has a mild climate , doesn't it ? __eou__ Yes , the climate of France rarely has severe winters . In southern France , one can live in comfort the whole year . Is Japan good for farming ? __eou__ Yes , Japan is good for farming . Rice is the main crop , but Japan is also an industrial center . Fishing is very important , too . Rice isn't grown in France , is it ? __eou__ No , rice isn't grown in France . But farming , fishing and industry are also very important in France . I'd like to go to Japan some day . Would you like to visit France ? __eou__ Yes . I'd like to visit France . I'd like to travel all over the world . As you describe it , France seems to be very much like Japan . I would like to see it for myself . __eou__

Can I see the paper when you're through , Sally ? __eou__ OK . I just want to read the comics . __eou__ Take your time . __eou__
Nowadays fewer and fewer people go to the movie theaters to see films . So I am afraid that the film studios are really getting hard time to survive . __eou__ What you said is true . But the film producers there are more flexible ways to get more audience . For example , to make more movie Ccds , so people will spend money buying them . __eou__ But it is true that cinemas are losing the attraction they used to have in the past . __eou__ Yes . Take myself for example . I seldom go to cinemas , but it doesn't mean I no longer see films ; instead , I see films at home-watching Ccds . __eou__

I need some markers , some color pencils , a pair of scissors , some highlighter , rulers .. __eou__ Wow , it is like a maze , I think I might get lost soon . __eou__ Don't worry.In fact , it is very easy to find what you want . Can you see the sign on top of every shelf . It clearly tells you what things are displayed on every shelf . __eou__ Oh , yes . You are so smart . I see them . So I have to go to shelf number 3 first to get my markers , color pencils and highlighters and somebrushes . __eou__ I also need some thumbtacks , whiteout and paper clips . Which shelf are they on ? I can't find the number . __eou__ It's at the back . I think you are near-sighted . You had better get yourself a pair of nice glasses . __eou__

We need to finalize the account with the Mexican Embassy and , I need some advice on phrasing this letter correctly in English . __eou__ Sure Tracy , let me just get my laptop . __eou__ Okay , so ... To Whom It May Concern , I am writing . __eou__ Um , Tracy ? I think that ' s a little too formal .

It's Tracy here , just . __eou__ Okay Tracy , now it's too relaxed ! You've still got to show some respect . How about starting with " Dear Ms .

" Dear Miss Cooper , I'm writing to confirm the final quotation for the full page back cover color advertisement you requested for the spring issue of Voila magazine " . __eou__ That's great ... __eou__ " The final costing , including advert design and production , comes to forty-five thousand six hundred RIB .

I hate to be the bearer of bad news , but it's that time of year again . Have you got your performance evaluations finished yet ? __eou__ Oh no ! Evaluations ! You can tell that's not my favorite job ; I haven't even started yet . When is the deadline for turning in thecompleted forms ? __eou__ Well , you do still have three weeks . But remember the employee must sign them , too . Filling them in is nothing - it's meetingwith the employees that takes so much time . __eou__ I never know how to rate the employees ' work . Of course attendance and productivity are easy , I just look at the sales figures . __eou__ So it's the subjective criteria like team building and colleague support that you find hard ? __eou__ Exactly ! Attitude ... how do you rate attitude ? __eou__ I suggest letting each employee fill out his or her own evaluation for those items . Then , based on their self - assessment , you can add your comments . It's a great starting point for discussion __eou__ Great idea . And after all , that's the whole point of an evaluation . I almost can't wait to give it a try . __eou__

Face it . __eou__ Good luck to us . __eou__

That guy Dave next to Zina never leaves . __eou__ Vince wants us to have everything debugged and ready to go by the end of the month . __eou__
There are advertisements everywhere here in hong kong . The city is so bright at night , with all the neon signs . __eou__ I like it . It makes the city feel alive . I like all the different colors and I like the billboards with eye-catching pictures and slogans . __eou__ I think that there are too many of them . I think that companies spend far too much money on advertising . They should have lower prices instead . Then they would see more . __eou__ I see your point , but if companies didn ’ t spend money on advertising , no one would hear about their products . I agree that some form of advertising can be annoying . I don ’ t like it when people try to give you leaflets with information about products you have no intention of buying . __eou__ I really hate receiving spam . I also dislike having to listen to advertisements and jingles when they are broadcast in stores or on the subway . __eou__ Yes , that annoys me too . With billboards , you can look away , but with broadcasts , you can ’ t avoid them . I like the way that advertising agencies use comedy in their campaign . __eou__ I like that too . I don ’ t like the way that advertising campaign often tell you if you don ’ t buy a certain product , you ’ re not cool or modern or efficient or something . __eou__ That kind of advertising seems to be very common with brand name products . They are always trying to maintain brand loyalty . __eou__
Who got ripped off ? __eou__ Big time ! A hacker broke into the company's files and got all her personal information . You really think it's completely safe ? __eou__ Well , maybe not 100 percent . I did hear about some tricks people use . __eou__ Now we're getting to the truth . __eou__ There are shills . A shill is someone who bids up the price of their own sale . __eou__ See ? And I bet that's easy to do online . Everybody's anonymous . __eou__

It'll be down for a minimum of twelve hours . If everything goes according to plan , it should be up again by 6 pm on Saturday . __eou__ That's fine .

One thing I love our boss for is that he always knows when to give you a pay raise without being asked for . __eou__ Really ? How can he be so sure about the timing ? __eou__ He just knows either by your excellent performance at work or by the annual review . __eou__ Well . This must save lots of employees from worrying about how to write a salary increase letter . You know how tough it is . Do all the employees receive the same pay increase annually ? __eou__ Actually not ! Our company pays for performance . __eou__ I like this system . It will encourage the best employees and motivate those who want to make a change at work . __eou__
Look ! It is not working well . Did you try out the bike when you bought it . __eou__ No , there ’ s no need .

I will pay attention to such a thing next time . __eou__

Hi , Mr . Brown , we have visited the factories and I'm very satisfied with your factories production conditions . __eou__ Yes , they are our main export bases of tools with the advantage of having good production experience and long historical record . All their products enjoy high prestige in the world market . __eou__ That's very good . But I have little knowledge about the packing of your pliers . I just want to know the details about that . __eou__ Ok , I'll show you how the packing is like . We have a showroom on the ground floor . Let's go downstairs and have a look . __eou__ Sure . __eou__ These are the various kinds of packing for pliers . Normally , we have three types of packing __eou__ Oh , the packing looks very nice . __eou__ The skin packing is the most advanced packing for this product in the world market . It catches the eyes and can help push sales . __eou__ Good , what about the export packing ? __eou__ Well , they are packed in boxes of two dozens each , 100 boxes to a wooden case . __eou__ Is the wooden case strong enough for transportation ? You see , 100 boxes of pliers are very heavy . It's about 2,400 kilograms . __eou__ You can rest assured of that . So far , no customers have complained about our outer packing . __eou__ I'm glad to hear that . By the way , do you accept neutral packing ? __eou__ Yes , we can pack the goods according to your instructions . __eou__ Very good . Ok , Mr . Brown , I'm now totally satisfied with your packing . You can execute our first order now , and I will open the L / C immediately after I return to Taipei . __eou__ All right . We'll make the shipment as soon as your L / C is on hand . __eou__
Yes ! I finally lost that last five pounds I've been working on forever ! __eou__ How did you finally do it ? __eou__ A friend suggested that I stop nibbling between meals . __eou__ Like snacking ? __eou__ You know , a little piece of chocolate here , some chips on the side , candy now and then ... __eou__ I get what you mean . __eou__ Instead , I sit down and have a good snack like a piece of fruit between meals . __eou__ I'm impressed . Good for you ! __eou__
I had a busy morning . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ I watered all the plants . __eou__ You have a lot of plants . __eou__ Then I did my laundry . __eou__ That takes some time . __eou__ I took the dog for a walk . __eou__ I'll bet he enjoyed his walk . __eou__ I vacuumed the entire house . __eou__ That's a lot of work . __eou__ And then I made lunch . __eou__ I'll bet you were hungry ! __eou__
You seem to be upset . What ’ s eating you ? __eou__ It ’ s because of my son . Dick keeps getting on my nerves __eou__ Dick ? How come ? He used to be as meek as a lamb . __eou__ Yes , he used to be . But now he ’ s drifting off track . __eou__ He must have been in bad company , or he wouldn ’ t be off the beans . __eou__
I'm worrying that she may be lost . __eou__ Be relaxed . She is familiar with the area . __eou__ After all , she is a five-year-old kid . __eou__ Ok , I'll go out and look for her . __eou__
How silly of you to jump out of the window ! __eou__ But that was the first thing that came into my mind when I heard the shout earthquake ! __eou__ Why not use staircases ? The terror was not so violent at that time . __eou__ That would be too late . __eou__ Maybe the situation is too urgent . __eou__ Yes , I think I should have jumped in any case . __eou__
Has the train come yet ? __eou__ No , I ‘ Ve been waiting for ages . __eou__ It ’ s so unreliable . I ’ Ve been late for my meetings all this week . __eou__ Yes , me too . I think I ’ Ve lost some important clients recently because of this train ! __eou__ Yes , my customers have started to complain too ! __eou__ Oh look ! Here it comes now ! __eou__
Bob , you're so lucky that you've come at the right time-the 2005 International Tourism Festival is around the corner . __eou__ We've heard about that festival before . It would be quite helpful if you could give us some highlights of the festival . __eou__ My pleasure . Well , the festival is going to start on the third Saturday of October , and covers over one hundred diverse programs in one month . __eou__ What do you think we can see during the festival ? __eou__ I don't know what to suggest . There're so many attractions , and they all sound interesting . One exciting program might be the Ten Thousand People Cycling round the Town . You can choose from the five routes that lead to different destinations . __eou__ I'd like to take the one that goes to the Wild Animal Park . __eou__ Then you can take Route No . 5 . Next I would suggest the International Dragon Boat Race where you can watch Lion Dance , Dragon Boat racing , and many other water shows . __eou__ Wow , must be interesting to watch dragon boats compete a-gainst one another on the city river . __eou__
Hey , Ben ... did you catch the game last night ? __eou__ Uh ... what game ? __eou__ Baltimore defeated Texas by 17 points ! __eou__ Um ... and what sport are we talking about here ? __eou__ Football of course ! __eou__ Oh ... football . Football is cool . I usually try to catch the World Cup finals . __eou__ No , I'm talking about American football . The World Cup is soccer . __eou__ Oh , I understand . I can't say I'm a big fan . I'm from China , and football doesn't have a really big following over there . __eou__ So Chinese people prefer soccer or basketball ? __eou__ Yes , I think so . But to be perfectly honest , I'm not really a sports nut.When I was in high school I played on the school volleyball team . Are you a diehard football fan ? __eou__ Oh , certainly . I wouldn't miss a game for the world . My girlfriend says I have an addiction . And actually , if I had to choose between her and my games ... I'd probably pick football . __eou__ It seems Americans are very passionate about sports . Is this just a part of your culture ? __eou__ Oh , yeah ! I think the love of sports starts when kids are very young . Americans come from many different backgrounds so I guess sports are something we can all enjoy together . __eou__
Too ... your face is really oily ... perfect ! __eou__ Why ? Are you planning to stir-fry my face ? __eou__ Nope . I'm going to tell your fortune . So ... the oilier , the better . __eou__ You've gone bonkers , Jen . __eou__ It's facial paper , and it fits into the rings of my binder ! It's magical . __eou__ OK . Let's see . Give me a sheet . __eou__
With tomorrow being Labor Day and all , I think it would be a nice gesture to let all the members of laboring staff leave work an hour early . What do you say ? __eou__ What ! That sounds perfectly ridiculous ! Labour Day is a holiday for everyone , not just laboring staff ... and we get a whole day off tomorrow anyway , so what's the point of an extra hour tonight ? __eou__ Well , we all get Labour Day off as a holiday , the real purpose of the holiday is to remember all the people who do manual or other hard labor . It's to celebrate those who work doing what other people might not be willing to do . I think we ought to do something in honor of the common worker . __eou__ So if we did allow the laboring force to go home early , how many people are we talking about ? __eou__ In our company , the loborial force makes up 60 % of our workers . We'd just be letting slightly over half the folks out a little early . __eou__
What made you decide on this type of occupation ? __eou__ Oh , to tell you the truth , I love the sky . When I was a child , I imagined flying into the blue sky some day . Now , I think the day has come . My dream will come true . And I like travelling very much and I enjoy working with people . __eou__ Can you make yourself understood in English without too much difficulty ? __eou__ Yes , I think I am quite fluent in English . I got the certificate of the Secondary English Training last month . __eou__ Do you know what the responsibilities are for a stewardess ? __eou__ The main responsibility of the stewardess is to make the passengers relaxed and happy during the flight . And good service is also important . __eou__ Are you in good health ? __eou__ I just had a complete physical examination and I am in top condition . __eou__ Have you had any nursing experience ? __eou__ Yes , I have two years of nursing experience , and now I am working as a nurse in a hospital . __eou__ How tall are you ? What about your eyesight ? __eou__ My height is one meter and sixty-eight centimeters . I've never had any vision problems . __eou__ What would you say are your strengths and weaknesses ? __eou__ One of my strengths is my friendliness and open-minded attitude and also I think I have a warm personality . But sometimes , I find it is hard to tell others when I don't like what they are doing . __eou__ If a passenger can't understand what you say , what should you do ? __eou__ I'll try to speak in another language or I'll try my best to use gestures and draw pictures . __eou__
Hi , buddy ! How do you deal with your salary ? __eou__ I usually put them into my bank account . I think that is a little secure , though the interest rate is low now . __eou__ Look ! This stock is rising now . I am researching it , and planning to buy some shares . __eou__ Have you invested in the stock market before ? __eou__ No . This is my first time to buy some . You can see that its historical price data is rising now . __eou__ But that is a little risky , you know . __eou__ Hey ! Do you still remember our teacher of economics , Mr . Locker ? __eou__ Of course ! I remember he has a part-time job as a stock analyst . __eou__ I can ask for some advice from him . __eou__
I have learnt how to ride a bicycle . I plan to go to the Water Park by bike this weekend . __eou__ Well , you know , the traffic in Beijing is sometimes dangerous .

Third , do not hurry up when riding , or would make an accident . Finally , remember come on the left and go on the right ! __eou__ Oh , my dear sister , I am no longer a baby ! __eou__
Ann , stop bugging Jess and help me order something new . Lattes are so passe these days . __eou__ Why don't you try an Americano ? Espresso with water . __eou__ Sounds a little weak . __eou__ Go with a hammerhead then-espresso mixed with drip coffee . __eou__ Sounds better , but I hope it doesn't inspire me to take a hammer to the client's head . __eou__ Don't worry , James . We'll get this case worked out in no time . __eou__
How's your thesis going ? __eou__ Don't mention it . The thesis due date is coming , but my thesis isn't even close to being done . __eou__ I've finished the first draft , but the professor said it's poorly written . I have to rewrite it . it's so depressing . __eou__ Don't worry . Anyway , you are better than me . __eou__
Do you believe in UFOs ? __eou__ Of course , they are out there . __eou__ But I never saw them . __eou__ Are you stupid ? They are called UFOs , so not everybody can see them . __eou__ You mean that you can them . __eou__ That's right . I can see them in my dreams . __eou__ They come to the earth ? __eou__ No . Their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space . __eou__ Aliens from the outer space ? Do you talk to them ? What do they look like ? __eou__ OK , OK , one by one , please ! They look like robots , but they can speak . Their mission is to make friends with human beings . __eou__ That means that you talk to them ? In which language ? __eou__ Of course in English , they learn English on Mars too . __eou__ Wow . Sounds fantastic ! __eou__
Do you know that scientists replicated a sheep into an identical clone . __eou__ I heard about that . It was successful . __eou__ It's a big jump in science . Maybe more like a leap . __eou__ I should say , it stunned me . I can't imagine what they will think of next . __eou__
Hi , Juliet , I'm treating Mr.Li and his team members from Galp to dinner tomorrow evening.Where do you think I should take them ? __eou__ Well , Mr.Li has very good taste in wine , and Galp is one of the biggest clients . I suggest you take them to a decent French restaurant . Make sure you make a very good impression . __eou__ That's a good idea . Which one do you recommend ? The Pairszone ? __eou__ Or Lapis . They are both listed this year glory magazine for have most of frantic Fetch cuisine in town . But I heard Lapis has a better wine selection . __eou__ We'll go to the place . Could you book a table for 4 at 7 PM ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__
Where are we going to visit today ? __eou__ We are going to the national park . __eou__ Really ? I have heard there are many famous national park in the US , which one exactly ? __eou__ The Yellow Rock National Park . __eou__ That's wonderful . I will see the Old Faithful for myself . __eou__
My , it looks too queer ! __eou__ Yes , it is a queer drug , a tonic only available in China . Many ancient Chinese medicine journals have recorded that it can cure such ailments as night sweat , pain at loins and knees and anaemia . It has no side effect . __eou__ Great ! Will you please tell me how to take it ? __eou__ Yes , madam . Fill 3 or 5 pieces of Cordyceps into a cleaned and chopped open duck's head and cook with the whole duck . Or stew Cordyceps with chicken . __eou__ That sounds very interesting ! __eou__ Please don't eat turnip and garlic when taking this medicine . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__
What are your responsibilities as a secretary ? __eou__ I did only simple things in the office , such as tidying up the office , serving tea , typing and filing , and so on . __eou__ What courses did you take in English secretarial studies ? __eou__ I took such courses as Secretarial Principles , Office Administration , Business English , and Public Relations . __eou__

What kind of promotional events are scheduled for the new product line ? __eou__ Marketing has us set up with product launches in five major cities , as well as some sponsoring events throughout the year . All together , there will be 15 events . __eou__ What kind of sponsoring are we talking about ? I don't know how effective sponsorship really is ... __eou__ It's not what you're thinking . These events will give us a wider exposure than most . Take the tri-city marathon for starters . This is a highly publicized event . The television exposure alone will nearly double our customer awareness . __eou__ Other than the marathon , what else is on the list ? __eou__ We've got a spot in Olympic Stadium sponsoring one of a team's equipment , then a rally for cancer research , and a connection to the inner-city education program . __eou__ Sports , medicine , education ... seems kind of random , don't you think ? __eou__ It might seem that way , but this events were all carefully chosen based on marketing research . These are the events that our customers and potential customers care about . __eou__
What's the matter here ? __eou__ Somebody broke into my house in the morning . __eou__ When did you find out ? __eou__ About 12 o'clock , when I came home from work . __eou__ Apparently forced entry . The lock is battered to pieces . __eou__ I wonder how the burglar did it . __eou__ He is so unskillful . I have never seen such an awkward burglar . __eou__ That's because we have a strong lock . __eou__ Probably . Let's check the inside then . __eou__ Did you find anything ? __eou__ Yes , the house was in a terrible mess . It was almost turned upside down by the burglar . __eou__ Oh , er ... sorry that's because we didn't have time to clean it . __eou__ You mean it is not created by the burglar ? __eou__ Definitely not , sir . __eou__
A funny thing happened to me the other day . __eou__ Oh , yes ? __eou__ I was just thinking about someone I went to school with , this boy I was quite friendly with in third grade . We used to hang out together - he lived next door - but then my parents moved and I changed schools and never saw him again . __eou__ Mmm . __eou__ Well , I was walking down Nan Jing Dong Lu ( Nan-Jing E . Rd . ) during my lunch break thinking about this boy-I have no idea why I was thinking about him . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes . And suddenly I heard someone call my name . I turned around and there was this man looking at me . I didn't recognize him at all , but he obviously knew who I was . __eou__ Oh , yeah , that's embarrassing when that happens . __eou__ You got it . Well , he walked up to me and said my name again and then I realized it was the boy I had been thinking about , the one from third grade ! __eou__
Did you see the information on sales for last year ? The sales review was made at our last board meeting . There's a great news for our shareholders . __eou__ Yeah , I went over the figures this morning . We're finally started making money again ! __eou__ We've never sold this much before , our growth this year has been phenomenal . We have captured 8 % of the market , up from last year by 120 % . Our strategy is working ! __eou__ not only our annual sales brake a record , but our month by month earnings exceeded our forecast as well . After a two-year slump , we finally back in the black . __eou__ The company's performance has improved since Wallace became president . He's made our little business into a real lucrative operation . Products are selling like hotcakes . __eou__ I think our success is partly because of Wallace's contribution , and partly because of our new marketing strategy . Because of the new advertising campaign , we have become the top sellers in the field . __eou__ Let's hope this stroke of good luck lasts . I hope we are over our financial difficulties for good . __eou__ Let's hope it is ! __eou__
Have you taken your temperature ? __eou__ Yes , and it is 37 ° C . __eou__ Well , open your mouth and let me have a look . It is nothing serious . You haven't got a fever . But you should take the medicine and need have more rest recently . When you feel well , you could take more exercises , or play sports like basketball , running , and swimming . And eating healthy food , having more fruits and vegetable and drinking milk are good for your heath . __eou__ Yes , I see . Thanks a lot . __eou__
Julie , what's on the tube ? __eou__ nothing but bench of commercials . These days the amount of commercials is amazing . __eou__ yeah . Maybe we can change to another channel . what about the sports channel ? Let's see if there's a game on . __eou__ okay . Nope , it's a replay of yesterday's soccer match between Brazil and Spain . __eou__ it was a good game , but not good enough to watch again . Keep surfing . __eou__ alright . Hmm , this movie is a rerun ... I don't know how many times I've seen this show ... Commercial again ... and a replay of the talk show ... oh no , this show is terrible , you don't wanna watch it . __eou__ oh , what is it ? __eou__ it's a total rip-off of an American reality show , but the imitation is unbearably clumsy . __eou__ oh , I know this kind of shows . Sometimes they really piss me off . If I wanted reality , I'd go outside . __eou__ yeah ... it seems what we have on TV now are either repeats , or commercials , or low-quality shows . There's really nothing to watch . __eou__ I don't get it . We have more than 100 channels and there's still nothing good on ! Maybe we should just turn off the TV , get outside , and do something real . __eou__ cool . __eou__
Did you enjoy your weekend at the highland hotel ? I heard it ’ s and excellent place to stay and has good facilities . __eou__ I had a wonderful time . The rooms are not very big , but they are well furnished . The restaurant is excellent and reasonably priced . There ’ s a sauna and a Jacuzzi . __eou__ Do they have a swimming pool ? __eou__ No , they don ’ t . they have a beauty parlor , but I didn ’ t go there . __eou__ What ’ s the service like ? __eou__ It ’ s very good . Check in and check out at the reception only took a few minutes . The wait staff is very good . A waiter recommended their baked fish , which tasted wonderful . The hotel was quite full , so I ’ d suggest making a reservation if you intend to go there . The hotel offers a discount at the weekends . __eou__ It sounds perfect . Did you have any complaints at all ? __eou__ There was a problem with the internet access , so I couldn ’ t check my email , but I didn ’ t complain about it to the management . __eou__ I suppose you were happy to forget about the outside world . __eou__ Yes , I was . Here ’ s their business card . __eou__ Thanks . Was there a mina bar in the room ? __eou__ No , there wasn ’ t . There is a bar on the ground floor and of course you can buy drinks in the restaurant to go with your meal . __eou__ One of the things I dislike about hotels is that everyone expects tips . __eou__ I know . At the inland hotel , they have an interesting policy . When you check out , you put some money in a special box at reception . Each evening , the money in the box is shared equally by the hotel staff . __eou__
I played the video game at Mike's home yesterday . __eou__ What's it like ? __eou__ It's really fantastic . The hero , Super Warrior , is so brave that he can defeat any enemies he meets . He runs through tunnels , swims under water , and climbs over bridges . It's really exciting ! __eou__ And then ? __eou__ I borrowed it from Mike yesterday . Why not have a try ? __eou__ That's neat ! __eou__
What did you buy at the market ? __eou__ I bought some special local products . __eou__ You seem to have bought the whole market ! __eou__ Yes . I really wanted to do so . I love those handicrafts , especially the paper-cut . __eou__ Paper-cuts are all hand-made . Let me see the paper-cuts you bought . They are all animals . __eou__ Aren't animals the main content of Chinese paper-cuts ? __eou__ All right . Animals , especially Chinese zodiac , are the most common theme in paper-cuts . But there are other themes . __eou__ Then I will buy some tomorrow . __eou__ Why do you want to buy so much ? __eou__ Because I want to send them to my friends . __eou__ I see . __eou__
Daddy , I love this Happy Farmhouse . It's really fun . __eou__ Great . But no talking , now . Don't forget that you are on a ladder . Take care ! __eou__ But you are holding it for me . Nothing to worry about . I trust you . Oops , what's that ? __eou__ Don't touch it with your stick . It's a bumble bees ' hive . Get down the ladder . Be quick . __eou__ What would happen if they started attacking you ? __eou__ You can get killed . No kidding . Remember , never stir up a hive . __eou__ I see . Why do people come all the way here to pick apples by themselves and take them home ? Isn't it easier for them to buy the apples in the supermarket ? __eou__ It's for fun . And also , the apples here are Green Food . __eou__ Come on , daddy . You can see that people only pick the red ones . __eou__ Silly boy . Green Food means the plants grown without using any chemicals , fertilizers , and pesticides . __eou__ Oh , then what would happen if there were pests ? __eou__ I heard they used ultraviolet lamp to kill pests . __eou__ Cool ! Well , let's go over there to join mom . I want to tell her all about the special pests-killing method . __eou__
But this place doesn't feel like a forty-ping apartment . __eou__ Well , it's forty pings including the balcony . See . It's huge . __eou__ Oh ! The view is great ! Mountains , fresh air ! Stars ? __eou__ This balcony is perfect for barbecuing . __eou__ And we could get a dog ! __eou__ I'm sorry . No pets are allowed in this apartment building , except fish . __eou__ Well , fish it will be then . __eou__
Hey , Susan . Have you got a sec ? I have some questions about my paycheck . __eou__ You bet , Emily . Pull up a chair . __eou__ Well , this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand . First of all , what is this FICA , and SUI Y tax , and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan ? __eou__ OK , let's start from the top of your pay stub . This number here represents your gross pay . __eou__ Then here we have a series of deductions . First off are the federal ones . FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act , or something like that . It's your federal income tax . And then there's Social Security and Medicare , which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work . __eou__ All right , I see . So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now . __eou__ That's right . Below the federal deductions are the state deductions . There's the state income tax , and then this SUI / SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up , but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take . __eou__ Yeah , I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that . So there are two separate income taxes — one at a state level and one at a federal level ? __eou__ That's right . Not all states have an income tax . Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead . __eou__ I see . All right , well I think everything else I can figure out on my own . The deductions for health insurance and my 401 ( K ) are pretty self-explanatory . Thanks for your help , Susan . __eou__ No problem ! All those deductions do add up , and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like . I can understand why you'd want some explanation . __eou__ Yeah , I guess it's the same in the UK , I just never paid much attention . See you later ! __eou__
You'd better prepare for the examination . __eou__ I don't think the exam will be very hard . __eou__ You should change your attitude , or you will not pass the course . __eou__ Maybe you're right . I have been too lazy lately . __eou__
Whip me if I get below 80 marks out of 100 ! __eou__ Take it easy , Jim . Your mother didn't mean it ! Need any help ? __eou__ Yes . Can you help me remember how to spell ' beautiful ' ? __eou__
Alice , I never knew you had such a lovely voice . You really can sing , can't you ? __eou__ Thanks , Mark . I used to be a member of the school choir . __eou__ No wonder you can control your voice so well . You are a professional singer . __eou__ Well , you are flattering me . I wouldn't say I am a professional , but I did receive some training at school . My music teacher used to be a professional singer . __eou__ Well , a good teacher makes good students . __eou__ You are quite right . __eou__
Every teacher likes him . __eou__ They say he can sum up like winking . __eou__ How he manages to do that is always a mystery to me . __eou__ Maybe he's gifted in that . __eou__
This shirt you gave me is not my favorite brand . __eou__ Don't look a gift horse in the mouth ! That was the best they had . __eou__
I wish I could unsay the sharp words to him . He must hate me very much . __eou__ He doesn't mind . As a matter of fact , he's very pleased . __eou__ Really ? Oh , thank Goodness ! __eou__
Mom , did you feel the earthquake this afternoon ? __eou__ Oh , that scared me . __eou__ The breaking news just reported some houses were destroyed by the earthquake . __eou__ Oh , dear ! How ruthless ! __eou__ Do you think we can donate some clothes and food for the victims ? __eou__ Why not ? That's a good idea to help them . __eou__
How was your date recently ? __eou__ Not too bad . It is seemingly too hard for me to find a place for our date . __eou__ I guess so . Going to watch a movie and having dinner at a restaurant are usual . __eou__ She said she wanted to go Dutch in dating . __eou__ Yes , now many girls want to be independent , so it is a little popular , especially among white collars . __eou__ But I am still traditional , so I felt weird when she paid for herself . __eou__ Forget about it ! __eou__ Are you satisfied with your girlfriend ? __eou__ It will be a long story . We have many differences , for example , she usually puts all her clothes into washing machine . That is the sort of thing I can not bear . __eou__
Do you have any year-end benefits ? __eou__ I don ’ t know till now . __eou__ I just saw a piece of news , that a group of white color workers hold a flour war in the office because of dissatisfaction of the year-end benefits . __eou__ Why they hold a flour war ? __eou__ They got rice , flour and oil as presents , while the leadership got 1000 yuan shopping card . __eou__ They are not feeling satisfied ? __eou__ It is said that the presents they got value less than 200 yuan , and it is no use for them at all , because they don't cook by themselves . __eou__ But how guilty to waste food ! __eou__
Now I know why I split up with Mike . We found we were simply not good for each other . __eou__ In what ways ? __eou__ Well , he is a typical Sagittarius guy , while I am a Cancer . We aren't really compatible __eou__ Ha-ha , so you believe in astrology ? __eou__ What's strange about that ! As a person born under the sign of Cancer , I am home-loving and wish for a peaceful family life . But according to astrology , Sagittarius guys are too adventurous and risk-taking.They seldom think of leading a settled and peaceful life . __eou__ Is that so ? I'm afraid it is too narrow-minded to judge people using astrology . It's all stereotypes ! __eou__ But in my case , the fact matches the theory . Mike is humorous , energetic , always as fresh as a daisy , but probably too ambitious . It frightens me ! __eou__ But as far as I remember , you two caught on like a house on fire when you first met . __eou__ Exactly . But later on , he cares more about his career than love . Work seems to be the better all , and all for him-so much that he doesn't even grudge sparing a day out with me . __eou__
My wife is really a chatter box . It ’ s so boring . __eou__ I have an idea . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ You just turn a deaf ear when she talks . __eou__
I want to give our kitchen the works . __eou__ Why ? I think it ’ s convenient and good . __eou__ No . The decoration has been out-of-date . My friends have a whole kitchen now . It ’ s modern . __eou__ Why should we run after the fashion ? __eou__ I am not running after the fashion . I just want a very beautiful and clean kitchen . __eou__
When I was a little boy , I had a dream of becoming a lawyer . __eou__ Your dream comes true now . __eou__ Yes , I knew I would make it . __eou__ You are really confident . __eou__
Hey Susan , what are you coming as this year ? __eou__ Coming as ? __eou__ Yeah ... for Halloween ! We have a big office party tomorrow evening . There's a prize for best costume ! __eou__ Um ... I have to confess , I haven't given it much thought . I'm from China and Halloween really isn't celebrated there . __eou__ Really ! You don't have some kind of Chinese ghost festival ? __eou__ Oh ... Sure . We have an entire month ! In traditional Chinese culture , Ghost Month is a period when the door between this world and beyond opens up and ghosts come back to earth for a visit . __eou__ Cool ! A whole month ! What do you do during that month ? __eou__ Well , people sometimes set off firecrackers , some people burn paper money as an offering and many people go to a temple to burn incense.Mainly though , you need to feed the ghosts because they're hungry . __eou__ Feed them ? __eou__ Yeah ... we set up tables with food , fruit and drinks and offer that to the hungry ghosts . __eou__ And then later everyone eats the food ? __eou__ Yes ! How did you guess that ? __eou__ It makes sense , right ? Who else is going to eat it ? __eou__ Good Point ! __eou__ But no dressing up like ghosts , right ? __eou__ No ! So ... is Halloween essentially the same thing as ghost month ? __eou__
Hi ! Tom . Fancy seeing you here It's a nice party isn't it ? __eou__ Yeah . Well it's quite some days since we were together last summer.How is everything going ? __eou__ Quite well . I got my MA degree two weeks ago . __eou__ Congratulations ! __eou__
Are you coming or not ? __eou__ I haven't decided yet . __eou__ Well , make up your mind . We need to know . __eou__ Ok , count me in . __eou__
How long do we stop over here ? __eou__ 2 hours . __eou__ What for ? __eou__ The plane must fuel before flying to Paris . __eou__ Can we get off the plane ? __eou__ Surely of course . __eou__
Excuse me , what time do you expect to land in Berlin ? __eou__ We should be there by 5 this afternoon . __eou__ Do you have any idea how long it will take to clean customs ? __eou__ Well , it all depends on traffic from other arriving aircraft . __eou__
Good morning , everybody . Welcome to IAM Technology . I'm very pleased so many of you could make it here today . My name's Sam Weiss . I'm the Production Manager .

Just to the right of Maintenance , there are steps up to the Lab and the Admin Section . Process Control is also on the upper level . It's located above the factory floor so that the operators can monitor everything that is going on below . __eou__
How do you understand the organizational structure of a company ? __eou__ The organizational structure is the company's framework of communication and authority . __eou__ Is it true that just like a human skeleton that defines their shapes , companies have structures that define theirs ? __eou__ Yes , you are right . __eou__

We have to slow down again . If we haven't meet the passing tree , we have to stop a car away . __eou__ What other signs what we see in road area like this ? __eou__ There are a plenty of signs such as Watch for children ! __eou__
This looks like a very nice house . __eou__ You know , I fell in love with this house the first moment I laid eyes on it . __eou__ The style of the exterior is just what I ’ Ve been looking for ! __eou__ The exterior is only half of the story . The interior is incredible . __eou__ This home is gorgeous on the inside ! __eou__ Everything that you see on the walls , floors , and windows is brand new . __eou__ The wall colors totally suit the style of this house . __eou__ Straight ahead is the gourmet kitchen . __eou__ I love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops . __eou__ The master suite is the best .

You sat with me in the girl's bathroom ... __eou__
So did you get in touch with your brother ? __eou__ No , not yet . I'm really worried . __eou__ Well , it'd be foolish to call the police . He probably just went away overnight . __eou__ Maybe you're right . But I'm still worried . __eou__

Morris was so pleased with your sales work on his account that he went straight to the top with it . He wrote a letter about it to Mr . Macmillan ! __eou__
I really think all Americans look alike . __eou__ You ’ re crazy ! You haven ’ t been here long enough . __eou__ But they do . __eou__ What makes you say that ? __eou__ They wear the same clothes , they ’ re all blond , they all drive cars , they all own Parker fountain pens ; they all drink Coca Cola , and they all chew gum . __eou__ I disagree with you . They don ’ t all wear the same clothes ; they ’ re definitely not all blond ; they don ’ t all own Parker fountain pens ; they don ’ t all drink Coca Cola , and they don ’ t all chew gum . I do think they all drive cars though ! But that doesn ’ t have anything to do with how they look ! __eou__ Maybe I am just homesick . I know you ’ re right . I just miss China , that ’ s all . __eou__
... Now that we have been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter , Ed ! Give us some good news . How are things looking for us in terms sales this month ? __eou__ Uh well ... would you like the bad news first or the really bad news ? __eou__ What ? Ed , don ’ t tell me you only have bad news ! __eou__ Well sir , our sales have dropped , no plunged , fifty percent in the past month alone . We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits refalling fast . The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory , or getting rid of our staff . If we consider redundancies , it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages . It ’ s a real mess . __eou__ For crying out loud ... How fast are we losing money ? __eou__ Um ... how can I put this ? Let ’ s just say that at this pace , we will be filing for Chapter eleven in less than three months . __eou__ What ! Geez ! How could this have happened ? So what ’ s the bad news ? __eou__ Oh , that ’ s the really bad news . Our supplier suffered QC problems and , well , half of our production is faulty . We ’ re going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter . And the worst part ? We ’ re going to have to shoulder this cost . __eou__ Are you joking ? Get the supplier on the line now ! They have to assume the costs of this mess ! __eou__ We tried that , sir . The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country . __eou__ We ’ re doomed ! __eou__ There is some really good news though ! __eou__ Really ? What ! __eou__ I got offered a new job ! __eou__
The sun is up ! Time for all the campers to rise . Time to get paddling . __eou__ Oh , no ! No more paddling ! My arms are sore ! __eou__ Do not worry . Today will be easier . __eou__ Beth , what date is today ? __eou__ Today is Saturday . __eou__ What is the date today ? __eou__ Today is July 4th . __eou__ Oh , i almost forgot . Today is my mom's birthday . __eou__ Call her on my cell phone . Wish her “ Happy Birthday ! ” Tell her you are out exploring the great American wilderness . Tell her I said she is lucky to be born on Independence Day . __eou__ Thanks ! I will do that ! When is your birthday ? __eou__ It is December 25th . __eou__ Wow ! What a lucky girl ! Your birthday is on Christmas Day . __eou__ Yes , I am lucky . I was born on Christ ’ s birthday . Maybe that is why I usually go to church on Sundays . When is your birthday ? __eou__ April 2nd . I missed being a target of a lot of jokes by one day . I guess I am lucky , too ! __eou__ That is true ! Here , have some Granola for breakfast . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ After eating , we will take down our tent . Then we will pack everything into the canoe , We can shove off by 6 __eou__ I guess so . __eou__ How about going for swim around 10 __eou__ That should work out great . You are miracle worker ! You have got me awake and motivated . __eou__ Happy Independence Day ! __eou__
It's really late but I'm starving . __eou__ Hey , that coffee shop's lights are still on . __eou__ Maybe they have some good pie . __eou__ I would love a really sticky cinnamon bun . __eou__ There was a coffee shop by my house when I was a kid that served cinnamon hot chocolate . __eou__ Mmmm . That sounds like something I had in Mexico once . __eou__ Good stuff ... Oh , no . The door is locked . __eou__ Ohhhhh ! And I just got all my juices going ! __eou__
How did you spend the weekend ? __eou__ I went to a movie with my boyfriend . __eou__ Really ? How was it ? __eou__ It was great . The director took a lot of care while framing . They say be has good chance at winning the Oscar for best director . Also I like the actors , some really great new young actors . __eou__ Oh , yeah ? What's it about ? __eou__ Well , it's the classic love story between two people from conflicting backgrounds . But besides a beautiful story , the cinematography is great . There is some really dramatic footage . It's really quite a visual feast . And the soundtrack is moving . __eou__ Sounds pretty good . Is it a tragedy ? __eou__ The ending is a bit of a surprise . I don't want to ruin it for you . __eou__ Oh , I like movies with surprise endings , although , sometimes they can be frustrating . Maybe I should invite my girlfriend to go next weekend . __eou__ It would be a really good choice . The movie is very suitable for lovers to see together . I'm sure you won't regret it . __eou__
What are you doing tonight ? __eou__ I have to run to the grocery store . __eou__ Don't you hate fighting the crowds on the weekends ? __eou__ Yes , but I am out of food and milk . __eou__ What store do you shop at ? __eou__ The small one , just down the street . I like their generic brand . __eou__ I have been using the store across town for years . __eou__ I hear they have very nice stuff . __eou__ They do , but they're a little expensive on certain items . __eou__ Well , you should try my store . The prices are good . __eou__ I will sometime . Thanks for the advice . __eou__
What ’ s the area of your country ? __eou__ It ’ s not very big . It ’ s a little over half a million square kilometers . __eou__ That sounds quite big ! How many people live there ? __eou__ There are about 30 million people in my country . Most of them live in the north . __eou__ What ’ s the average income ? __eou__ That ’ s the really hard to say . I think most people earn about two thousand dollars a month , if you convert the money from our currency into dollars . __eou__ So your country is fairly rich . __eou__ I think we are richer than most countries , but not as rich as countries in western Europe . Our biggest problem at the moment is unemployment , which is roughly 8 % . It has doubled over the last four years . __eou__ Unemployment in my country is a fraction of that . __eou__
For our lunch meeting with the investors , do we have to make a reservation at the restaurant or do we just show up ? __eou__ Usually for lunch , we don't have to reserve a table , they should allow walk-ins . But to be on the safe side , I'll order a table for half-past twelve . Will that suit your schedule ? __eou__ I've arranged to meet them at the restaurant at twelve . Can you make the reservation a little earlier ? If we start earlier , it will give us more time for a longer lunch . __eou__ Are you planning on treating the investors to a full-course meal ? __eou__ Yes , we'll start with appetizers , follow with a soup and salad course , then main dishes of prime rib or cordon bleu chicken , and finish up with a delicious rich dessert of some sort . __eou__ That'll be pretty heavy for a mid-day meal , don't you think ? __eou__ As along as we stay away from anything alcoholic , we should be okay . __eou__ With your prime rib and chicken choices , you'd better hope nobody's vegetarian . __eou__ We can make some special arrangement if we need to . After all , it's the company who is footing the bill . __eou__
Welcome , sir . May I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I wanna go to America for my vacation . __eou__ No problem . Actually , we have some great packages . The most exciting season of Hawaii is now . How about a relaxing vacation in Hawaii ? __eou__ Sounds good . Are there any group tours I can go with ? __eou__ Yes . There will be one at the end of this month . For many people , a Hawaiian vacation promises languid days filled with sunbathing and poolside cocktails . For others , it ’ s all about non-stop action in one of the world's most extreme natural playgrounds . Whether you are in search of quiet relaxation or unbridled stimulation , Hawaii gives you the best of both . __eou__ Great . So how long is the trip ? __eou__ 15 days . The transportation by air will take five days . __eou__ Fine . I happen to have 20 days for holiday , so exciting ! How many places will be visited and what are they ? Where will be staying and how about the food there ? __eou__ Sir , let's do it step by step . First , we will visit over 25 different places . Most of the places are in Hawaii ’ s Big Island . We will stay in Arlott ’ s Lodge __eou__ Well , cool . What's the price for this trip ? __eou__ Well , right now there's a special rate for 40,000 RIB for this package , including everything such as airline ticket , tour guides , hotels and food . All you have to do is to sign up and we will take care of everything . __eou__ Well . 40,000 RIB that's really a lot of money . I will have to think about it . __eou__ Sure . By the way , this special price is only good through the end of the week . __eou__ Is it Thursday ? I mean if I let the chance slide ... __eou__ Yes , sir . It will be a great pity ! __eou__ Well . Ok , I will take it . __eou__ Thank you ! __eou__
Morning , Peter . Nice suit ! A new one ? __eou__ Oh , yes . My wife bought it for me yesterday . Hmm , you look nice in that yellow dress . Yellow suits you really well . __eou__ Maybe . Several people have suggested that I get more yellow clothes . They say the color suits me because I have a fair complexion . __eou__ That's right . You know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . Actually , I think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . It's just that different colors can give people different impressions . For example , black could make you look mature , while pink could make you look young and energetic . __eou__ Thank you for your compliments . It sounds like you're a clothing expert . __eou__ Well , compared with my wife , I'm just a beginner . __eou__
Earning extra income on the Internet is easier than you might think . After I started selling traditional craft items on the Internet last year , I have really been able to make bank doing something I love . __eou__ Is that right ? I hear all these horror stories of internet business crashing because there is not enough of a customer base yet . How can you be sure your idea will cash in ? __eou__ To run a successful internet business , it requires a little research and relatively small investment . You've got to have a good idea of some kind of product that is in demand or would be popular . __eou__ That's marketing research ... But what about getting started once you have an idea ? __eou__ After you have your great idea , then you can set up shop by registering a domain name , creating a website , an email address , and a hosting service . If you want to go all out on your website , you can put together shopping cart technology , but that can be pricey to start out with . __eou__ Sounds like a lot of work ! __eou__ Anything worth doing takes work . Money doesn't grow on trees ... Most of us have to work for it . __eou__
Hello Mr . Jones , please have a seat . Thank you for coming in today . I have read your resume . You completed University in England ? __eou__ Yes , I went to Cambridge . After graduation , I started right away into the advertising industry . Later , I made a bit of a switch to focus on marketing research . __eou__ So , what experience do you have ? __eou__ I have ten years marketing experience . This includes both entry level and management positions . In my last position , I worked my way up to being director of the marking department . __eou__ I can see that from your resume.Your last position was marketing director for a pharmaceutical company , is that right ? Later , why did you decide to leave your former post ? __eou__ I felt after five years in one place , I was ready for something new . I would like to have a job that is challenging , something that I can see and do new things every day . I loved many things about my former job , and I left with amiable feelings on both sides . I was just ready for something new . __eou__ I see . Do you want to work full-time or part-time ? __eou__ I would rather work full-time . __eou__ I'll make note of that . Now , what are your salary expectations ? __eou__ I am willing to negotiate , but I expect at least $ 40,000 a year . __eou__
Can you manage chopsticks ? __eou__ Why not ? See . __eou__ Good mastery . How do you like our Chinese food ? __eou__ Oh , great ! It's delicious . You see , I am already putting on weight . There is one thing I don't like however , MSG . __eou__ What's wrong with MSG ? It helps to bring out the taste of the food . __eou__ According to some studies it may cause cancer . __eou__ Oh , don't let that worry you . If that were true , China wouldn't have such a large population . __eou__ I just happen to have a question for you guys . Why do the Chinese cook the vegetables ? You see what I mean is that most vitamin are destroyed when heated . __eou__ I don't know exactly . It's a tradition . Maybe it's for sanitary reasons . __eou__
That'll be eight dollars , please . __eou__ Here's ten . Keep the change . __eou__

Last week , I only went to workout once . __eou__

What's your major in college ? __eou__ I take architecture as my major . __eou__ What research are you dealing with now ? __eou__ I am dealing with the study of the architecture style of ancient Chinese buildings . __eou__
I simply couldn ’ t help giving him the fish-eye when I knew all that . __eou__ But Ben is not a bad man . I know him from A to Z . __eou__ However , he disappointed us very much this time . __eou__ I can understand that . But ... __eou__
How was your first date , David ? Are you satisfied with Jane ? __eou__ It was all right . She , tall and attractive , has stable job and source of income . __eou__ Yes , so I think she is suitable for you . __eou__ But , well ... what I want to say is ... __eou__ Stop acting like this . Say away ! __eou__ Her standard for selecting life partner is a little higher . I can not accept that . __eou__ What did she say ? __eou__ She said she want a man with large house , luxurious car and healthy parents . __eou__ Give her up . __eou__
It seems like it rains every time we plan a picnic . __eou__ Well , that's life . __eou__
How did you get into hip hop ? __eou__ Well , all my friends listen to it , so I became a big fan too . __eou__ Who is your favorite hip hop artist ? __eou__ I'm a big fan of Snoop Dog . __eou__
Do you consider yourself a good mother ? __eou__ Yes , I'm a very good mother and successful career woman . __eou__ How can you manage to do both ? I mean , it is so hard to be a working mother . __eou__ I think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself , like keeping housework simple , spending money on things that make life easier , buying yourself things you like , and so on . You can only be nice to others when you can be nice to yourself . __eou__ Does your husband feel the same ? __eou__ Yes . He is very understanding and supportive . __eou__
I know you have a son . How old is he ? __eou__ He's going to turn six next month . __eou__ Who is looking after him ? __eou__ My mother-in - law . She retired last year . __eou__ You really are lucky ! __eou__ Yeah , I know . __eou__
Actually the general manager is regarded as a baby doll . He has much sympathy . __eou__ That's right . And his wife is a baby doll , too . She used to have many followers . __eou__ Were you one of them ? __eou__ Nothing of the sort . I can't hold a candle to her . __eou__

We are only paying on 50 % of this . There is still inflation to consider . __eou__ You can knock off another 2 % for that . __eou__ We can borrow as much as we can . __eou__ Not quite , if we get too heavily in debt , the shares will tend to drop . __eou__ How much loan capital can we safely raise then ? __eou__ I would like to have notice of that question , I will give you an answer in a week . __eou__

I came here by bus , and it took me about 15 minutes . __eou__ Oh , yes.How old are you ? __eou__ Twenty . __eou__ Hum , still a student ? __eou__ Yes , I'm student of grade 3 in the university majoring in economics . __eou__ What subjects are you studying ? __eou__ English , math , commercial and legal studies , and accountancy . __eou__ Have you had any working experience . __eou__ Well , I worked at a supermarket during last summer holidays . __eou__ What do you like to do in your spare time ? __eou__ I like sports very much.Besides that , I also like working on a computer in my spare time . __eou__ How are your English and computer skills ? __eou__ I have passed the CET - 4 and 6.As far as computer is concerned I can use the computer for word processing . __eou__ Okay . Mr.Liu , we'll inform you of the results within a week . __eou__
Could you do something to advance your shipment ? __eou__ It's hard to say . But why ? __eou__ We expect the goods to be on the market before the end of December to catch up with the Spring Festival sales . __eou__ I can understand your position . We can not make any promise , but we'll try our best . __eou__
Marry ; Mr . Johnson wants these documents to be copied . __eou__ Oh , no . You see I'm in the middle of something . Could he wait ? __eou__ I'm afraid ... __eou__ All right , all right . He'll get them as soon as possible . __eou__
I am very interested in a new apartment near the Taxing Plaza , but the price is very high , I really can't afford it . __eou__ How much is it for each square meter ? How large is the apartment ? __eou__ It's 7500 yuan per square meter , and I really like the one with three bedrooms and a large living room . Its total area is about 80 square meters . __eou__ That surely will cost you a lot of money . Are you going to make a full payment ? __eou__ Do you think I am rich enough to make it ? I am thinking about buying the apartment by installments . The real estate agency says if I pay a 25 % down payment , I can move in at once . __eou__ If sounds so tempting . Why not go applying for a loan from the bank ? They charge very low interest , so you can choose whether to pay up the balance in 10 or 20 years . __eou__
You like movies ? __eou__ Yeah , I think it's the best way to relax . __eou__ What type do you like the best ? __eou__ Really it depends on my mood . When I am sad or depressed , I like comedies . If I'm feeling good , I'll watch almost anything . __eou__ I see . I generally like movies to help calm me down . I think a sign of a good movie is the ability to bring you into the story as if you were part of it . __eou__ Yeah , unfortunately , nowadays directors are often more interested in making money than making a good film . __eou__ True . The movie industry is becoming more and more commercial . You see a lot of expensive movies with little artistic value . I generally think those made in the forties are of higher quality on the average than movies today . You can name a lot of classics from that decade . __eou__ Yeah , many of my all-time-favorites were made in the forties . They've already stood the test of time and will stay with us for a long time . __eou__ I'm totally with you on that . __eou__
Thank you.Steven.That was the most magnificent meal I've had abroad.You ' ll have to let me reciprocate the next time you're in Beijing . __eou__ Don't worry about it , Lin.That ' s no big deal.You know , Americans appreciate China's rich culinary culture . Just excuse me for a second while I check the number here and figure out how much to give the waiter.Hmm , by the way , what do you do about tipping in China ? __eou__ We don't . __eou__ No tipping ? Now that's what I call a civilized system . __eou__ At hotels and some restaurants they add a service charge to the bill , but other than that , tipping isn't customary . __eou__ What about cab drivers and porters ? __eou__ In a cab you just pay what it says on the meter . I generally tip hotel porters 10 yuan per bag , but in first-class hotels they're instructed not to accept gratuities . __eou__ You'd have a revolution on your hands if you tried to introduce that sort of system here . __eou__
Where did you get all these barney tour pamphlets ? __eou__ I took them from a travel agency . Look at those nice pictures , lash forest , palm fringed , white sand beaches , crystal blue ocean , they ’ re breath-taking . It is like paradise on earth . __eou__ That ’ s why it ’ s become a very popular holiday destination these years . Someone told me the service there is very good too . Are you planning to spend the holiday there ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m thinking about signing up for a tour in the travel agency . Their next tour starts the same time as my holiday does next month . __eou__ How many days is the tour ? __eou__ 10 days . When I get back , I still have two days to go before work . Isn ’ t that great ? __eou__ That ’ s a perfect plan . Enjoy yourself . __eou__
Margaret , I'd like to follow up with the arrangements for our company retreat , to take place next month . We need to book the venue , make arrangements for speakers and door prizes , and set up all the activities and accommodations . Also , very important , we need to determine which of our staff will be eligible and will be available to go . We've got to get a head count in order to make reservations . __eou__ What's the criteria for staff to attend ? Are we only including our management team in this affair ? Or will we be extending invitations to lower level employees to attend ? __eou__ Lower level employees need not attend . The purpose of this retreat is for training , especially for our management team . We want to develop a well-oiled machine on our executive level . In order to get everyone to jell together , we've got to include some fun . That's the reason for the retreat . __eou__
Egg , this bathroom is a pigsty ! __eou__ Helen , why do you keep flushing the toilet ? What's wrong ? __eou__ I just can't stand it . It's really gross in here ! There ' s a stain on the toilet seat , and the floor was wet and slippery . So I cleaned it ! __eou__ You did what ? Helen , I know it's gross , but I ' Ve seen many public washrooms that are much worse . Why are you cleaning the counter top ? are you out of your mind ? __eou__ I can't help myself ; it's just so disgusting in here ! __eou__ Helen , this is not like your own bathroom . Just leave it to the cleaners , okay ? __eou__ Hang on . I'm just gonna quickly wipe the sink and sweep the floor . __eou__ You're such a neat freak ! I'm outta here ! __eou__
Who is it ? __eou__ Supervisor . Open the door . __eou__ Wait a sec . __eou__ What are you doing here ? __eou__ We're watching a football match . What's the matter ? __eou__ Your neighbors complained that you were so noisy that they can't sleep . __eou__ I'm sorry about this . __eou__ Please turn down the TV . And not another shout or I'll have to report you to the school administration . __eou__ You can rest assured that we won't disturb others anymore . __eou__
Did you happen to bring that book that we were talking about yesterday ? __eou__ I did . Let me go get it for you . Here you go . __eou__ Thanks so much . __eou__ I like the way that the gifts I get increasingly more lavish . __eou__ I had no idea that there were specific things that should be given on different anniversaries . __eou__ So what does it say you should give your wife this first anniversary ? __eou__ It says that traditionally , give something made of paper . __eou__ I can think of two things made of paper — stationery and money . __eou__
How did your vacation go ? __eou__ I traveled the Three Gorges . __eou__ What about the trip ? Do you enjoy yourself ? __eou__ Yes , we had a good time . The trip was terrific . We toured the Three Gorges by boat . Its realty exciting ! __eou__ Did your boat float down the river ? __eou__ Yes . There are many places where the gorge is very narrow , with steep cliffs on both sides . __eou__ Sounds dangerous . __eou__ Yes , but we have life jackets . And we got a real kick out of that . __eou__ What a thrilling trip ! __eou__
Do you like swimming ? __eou__ Yes . Swimming is one of my most favorite sports , indoors or out-doors . __eou__ Me too . Swimming is a very good exercise for health . It combines water , bath , sunbath , and air bath together . It promotes the growth and haleness of muscles , bone , viscera and nerve systems . __eou__ I have never thought that swimming can bring us so many benefits . I only know that swimming in great waves and deep running water can train people's spirits , and enable people to be fearless of the hardships , dangers and difficulties and become brave and staunch . __eou__ Have you ever swum in a river or a lake ? __eou__ Yes , but not always . However , I won't let it go if I have a chance . __eou__
Your house is too small . Why not buy a big one . __eou__ I do wish I could afford one . __eou__ You can get a loan from the bank . You know LPF program provides low cost loans for participants home purchases . __eou__ Of course I know that . But don't you notice that the house price is skyrocketing ? __eou__
Well , humans could never make something like that . __eou__ Those poor Egyptians slaves worked so hard and you want to give aliens all the credit ! __eou__ Be a little more open-minded , Stu ! Don't believe everything you read in your history books ! __eou__ OK , but don't believe everything you see on The X-files , either ! __eou__ Speaking of The X-files , it's on right now ! __eou__
I am glad to meet you , Mr.Joey . __eou__ Hello , Mr . lie . I would like to discuss with you the feasibilities of establishing a joint venture with your company . __eou__ That is excellent , your investment proposal is a wise decision . May I have some idea of your suggestion ? __eou__ I suggest that we set up a board of directors for the management of the company and share rights and obligations as equal . That is very important . __eou__
When you were in school , what were your favorite subjects ? __eou__ I enjoyed everything , as long as I was learning . __eou__ Still , you must have had some subjects you enjoyed more than others . __eou__ Yes , I did like Spanish and Music . But I don't remember much Spanish . __eou__ That's too bad . We could really use someone who is bilingual . __eou__ If you hire me , I'll start studying Spanish again . __eou__
Did you work in a charity organization ? __eou__ Yeah , I had been in the charity organization for 2 months and I learned a lot from that experience , including love , sympathy , equality , and so on . __eou__ In what way did those social activities have impact on your mind ? __eou__ I think it had direct impact on my way of thinking . I learned to look at people and things from an overall perspective . In that case , I am not easy to be edgy . __eou__
Where can I find information on this subject ? __eou__ I'm not sure . Let's look up the catalogue . __eou__ Will you give some advice on this experiment ? __eou__ I advise that step be taken in power supply first . __eou__ What's his suggestion for this work ? __eou__ His suggestion is that the work be started at once . __eou__ The way I see it is that they'd join us . __eou__ I think so too . __eou__
Hi , Dave . You're early . __eou__ So you knew it was me ? __eou__ I had an idea . __eou__ Look , before we get into the secret admirer thing , I want to talk to you about WebTracker . __eou__ I'm sorry . I know you feel betrayed . __eou__ So you're really planning to quit invoking and switch over to WebTracker ? __eou__ My mind is made up . __eou__
John ? I have to say I was bothered by the way you handled the meeting today . __eou__ How so ? I thought it went fine . __eou__ I think it would have been better if you had given us more of a chance to give our opinions . __eou__ I ’ m sorry . I thought we were all pretty much in agreement . __eou__
What are your terms of payment ? __eou__ Our terms are net 30 . __eou__ What if we purchase an increased quantity ? Can you give us better terms ? __eou__ You would have to order in excess of 10,000 units to be eligible . __eou__ We do not have the space in our warehouse to store over 5,000 units . __eou__ An option we can offer is two separate shipments.We will house the inventory until you are ready for us to ship it to you . __eou__
OK , so are you ready to learn how to bake a cake ? __eou__ Almost , let me just put my apron on . __eou__ OK , so the first thing we are going to do is pre-heat the oven , that way we have it at the desired temperature once we finish preparing everything . Set it to three hundred and seventy five degrees Fahrenheit . __eou__ Got it . __eou__ No we are gonna make the batter . Take some butter and sugar and mix it lightly until you have a nice consistency . Then add some vanilla extract and eggs and continue mixing . __eou__ Do I have to use a whisk or can I use the electric mixer ? __eou__ Go ahead and use the mixer , but put it on medium speed . I'm gonna sift the flour and baking powder separately and then we can mix it with milk and the rest of the ingredients . __eou__ OK , so now we need a baking pan right ? __eou__ Yeah , but grease and flour it first so the cake won't stick to it when it bakes . __eou__ Done . So how long do we bake it for ? __eou__ We can leave it in there for about twenty five minutes . Then we let it cool for ten minutes before we remove the cake from the pan . __eou__ Wow ! This was a lot easier than I thought ! __eou__
I remember you said that you like China because it has cheap beers . __eou__ Yes , unbelievably cheap . Carlsborg is less than $ 1 . __eou__ Why do you drink ? I mean , where does drinking get you ? __eou__ It's fashionable . __eou__ Come on , you don't even know that blinds following is a sign of immaturity . __eou__ Mary , it's not about the blind following . What matter is I enjoy in drinking . It's like when you get off of work . You're so tired . You need to get relaxed . You can't just turn on the TV and keep watch the programs until you fall asleep . You need to make your after work time more fun . __eou__ How ? By drinking ? __eou__ Drinking is just part of it . I mean , you have a bunch of friends coming by and having fun . You drink and talk . And the more you drink , the more you talk . It makes me so relaxed . __eou__ When did you begin to drink ? __eou__ It's a long time ago . When I first went to a bar to pick up girls there , I saw the most beautiful girl sitting and sipping a coke . Then I went up to her and said ' can I buy you a drink ? ' __eou__ And then ? __eou__ Then I talked to her and got her number . You know what ? When you don't know what to say ? Just drink . __eou__ So you get drunk every day ? __eou__
Excuse me , is this the right counter for express mail ? __eou__ Yes , it is . What can I do for you ? __eou__ I want to send some important documents to Canada for my postgraduate admission . __eou__ Are they urgent , please ? __eou__ Yes , the deadline for applying is 1st Feb , so I hope they will arrive in 3 days . __eou__ Well , DHL is famous for its speed and reliability . It is the fastest international postal service available . The document will arrive in two or three days . __eou__ Really ? But can you guarantee the safety ? __eou__ Yes , I promise . Your document won't be broken or lost . All the items are handled by special staff and carried by a courier . It is reliable . __eou__ OK . I will send them now . __eou__ Please write the address and remittee on the express order and make sure there is no mistake on them . __eou__ All right . Here you are . __eou__ This is your receipt which you have to keep until the remittee receives the express . You can also check your post on our web . The post number is on the top of the receipt . __eou__ Thank you . I have got quite clear idea of it . __eou__
Excuse me , what material is it ? __eou__ Rhaki.Do you want some ? __eou__ No , where are the cotton cloths ? __eou__ I will show you . __eou__ What is the shrink rate after washing ? __eou__ Less than 5 % . It's quite durable . __eou__
I want to buy some cloth to make a curtain . Which one is better ? __eou__ What about the twill ? It washes well and won't lose shape . __eou__ What about the cotton one ? __eou__ Well , it's cheap and actually the color fades easily when washed . __eou__
Hello . __eou__ Hi , my sweetheart . It ’ s Dad . __eou__ Hi , Dad . Where are you ? __eou__ I ’ m at work right now . You can reach me at 905 675 9870 . Please call this number if you need me . __eou__ Thank you , Dad . __eou__ I love you . __eou__ I love you , too , Dad . __eou__
Whew ! I had to wait for almost an hour to get to the front of the line . __eou__ You have much patience . __eou__ Wow ! Your calligraphy is very beautiful . It was worth the wait ! __eou__ Thank you . Today I'm writing a kind of poem called a Chinese couplet . __eou__ What does it say ? __eou__ This is an especially famous one . It says " May the passing days bring you health and longevity . May this season of renewal find you basked in riches . " __eou__ That's very nice . Is it for sale ? __eou__ No . I never sell my artwork . __eou__ Really ? Then what do you do with it ? __eou__ I give it away . Here , this one is for you . __eou__ Wow ! Really ? Are you sure ? Now I'll have a lucky year ! __eou__ Remember , real luck must be created ( by ) yourself , and then it cannot be given or taken away ... __eou__
What a lovely day . The sun is shinning and the sky is so blue . It's a perfect day to go to the beach and get a beautiful tan . __eou__ Great idea . Unlike you , I just want to enjoy watching the sea and playing with the sand . I do not want to get a tan because I look good in pale skin . __eou__ Come on . Getting a tan symbolizes health and wealth in western countries . __eou__ While the pale color symbolizes beauty and elegance in most Asia countries . __eou__ That is a really interesting fact . __eou__ I will bring a big hat and apply a lot of sunscreen before setting off the beach . __eou__ Just do whatever you feel like doing . __eou__ ( At the beach ) My bag is so heavy . Let's put the stuff under the tree . __eou__ Good idea . It is always cooler in a shade . __eou__ I can't wait to play in the water . My feet are burning when I stand on the sand . __eou__
Just make yourself at home . __eou__ Thank you . You are cooking up a storm . __eou__ Wouldn't you like some more chicken ? __eou__ No , thank you . I'm afraid I can't take in anymore . __eou__
It's said that John's broken up . __eou__ Really ? But his wife has always waited on him hand and foot . __eou__ I hear that John's leading a double wife . __eou__ It's very bad of him to cheat on a lady like his wife . __eou__
Don't just stand outside . Come on in . __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ This is Alex . Remember ? This is Sean . __eou__ Nice to meet you guys . __eou__ Over there are Stacy and Rebecca . We're all on the school's tennis team . __eou__ Who's that guy who's handing out beer to everyone ? __eou__ That's my boyfriend Matt . Isn't he cute ? __eou__ He sure is ! __eou__ Come on . I'll introduce you two . __eou__
Uncle , have a heart , please lend your new car to me . Only once . __eou__ Where are you going ? __eou__ I have a big date tonight . __eou__ You have got a car , haven ’ t you ? __eou__ Oh , please . Only once lend your new car to me . __eou__
OK , Ann , you spent quite a bit of time in Australia recently so why don't you talk about that ? __eou__ I really liked living in Australia . I was an international student and I studied education at the university of Sydney . And living in Sydney was fantasticbecuase I could go to the beach anytime I wanted and there was a great nightlife in Sydney . There are lots of great clubs . And people were very , very friendly and easy-going and I met a lot of international people in living Sydney . __eou__ Mm-hm . How long were you there ? __eou__ I was there for almost a year . __eou__ Oh , OK . __eou__ And I travelled a little bit in Australia . I went up the east coast . Up to Frasier Island . Which is a world heritage site . And I saw dingo running along the beach and sharks in the water . We climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the ... , which is a but north . And the further north you go in Australia , the hotter it gets . So we were able to go swimming in the ocean and I went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky cause I didn't have a diving license , so I went on an introductory dive and I saw a giant clam that had a really purple spongy inside that I was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly . __eou__ So , did you , did you lose your finger ? __eou__ Almost . __eou__ Almost . Ah , you're lucky . Um , it's funny , you go in the water and you worry about sharks , but not clams . __eou__ Exactly . __eou__ Will you be going back to Australia soon ? __eou__ I'd like to go and live there for at least another year . Probably I'll go back to Sydney or maybe I'll go down to Melbourne because it's a really interesting cultural city . They have lot of museums and parks . __eou__
Hello Michael . __eou__ Hello Todd . __eou__ We're going to talk about Australia . Or your going to talk about Australia . So first of all how any people live in Australia ? __eou__ Australia ? Oh , there's about twenty million people in Australia right now . A little bit under , but close to twenty . __eou__ OK . What are the biggest cities ? __eou__ The biggest city ? The biggest city is Sydney , then it's followed by Melbourne and then Brisbane and then I think it's Perth . But most of the big cities are on the East Coast of Australia . And Perth is on the west coast , but sort of of out there by itself . __eou__ OK . Um , if you had to live in one place where would you live ? __eou__ I like Brisbane . I had my teenage years in Brisbane , growing up in Brisbane , um or maybe Sidney because it is a big city , but Brisbane has got the gold coast and the sunshine . __eou__ Oh , nice . Actually , what is the capital city of Australia ? __eou__ Ah , Canberra is the capital city . But is not the biggest city . Sydney is the biggest city . Canberra was made sort of by the politicians so Sydney wouldn't get to crowded . It's a separate territory . __eou__
Is that you , Dave ? Oh , my gosh ! The backstabber who left us to work for the evil WebTracker ! __eou__ Yeah , yeah , yeah . Hi , Mary . How are you ? __eou__ I'm filthy rich ! Haven't you heard about the MicroPower deal ? __eou__ Yeah , I guess I did . They're going to buy invoking ? __eou__ That's right . For seventy-five million . So how are you ? __eou__ I'm getting by OK . I heard MicroPower was going to make Zina president of their new invoking Internet division . __eou__
I ’ m not a Christian . I just want to know why Americans believe that sort of thing . __eou__ Believe what ? __eou__ You know ... like , say God is the creator of the universe , the Bible , and Jesus Christ ... __eou__ You don ’ t believe that ? Everyone interprets the Bible in a different way . To some people , the Gospel 5 is a source of much comfort . __eou__ What do you believe , John ? Are you Christian ? __eou__ To tell you the truth , I don ’ t know if I ’ m a Christian or not . Christians don ’ t often share the same belief . But I believe that we all possess , by the grace of God , the potential to create fantastic changes on this earth . __eou__ Do you believe that one religion is better than another ? __eou__ No , all religions are essentially based on the same ideals , so no one is really better . __eou__ Do you go to church regularly ? __eou__ When I ’ m home in the States , I go , but not in China . __eou__
Anyone home ? Jen ! __eou__ I'm in the kitchen ... let yourself in ! __eou__ Wow ! You're really working up a storm ! __eou__ I know . I've even worked up a sweat . __eou__ You look like a cooking show host--only messier . __eou__
Ann , let's go , or we will be late . __eou__ What time is it ? __eou__ It is already 10:25 . __eou__ Well , we still have about 15 minutes . __eou__ What time did you say the train is leaving ? __eou__ 12:05 . And it takes only 20 minutes to get to the station by bus . __eou__ Yes , but what will happen if the bus is late ? __eou__ Relax , those buses run every 10 minutes , so we have plenty of time . __eou__ ( still on the bus . ) What time is it ? __eou__ It is a quarter to twelve . __eou__ Oh dear , we will miss our train . __eou__
Mrs . Phoebe , let's talk about the delivery arrangement for our goods . __eou__ Sure . What's your date of delivery ? __eou__ I informed my company and was told that the first five thousand by the end of this month . __eou__ What about the balance of the order ? Can they also arrive at our company quickly ? __eou__ We can deliver the balance at the price already quoted in 10 days . __eou__ Can you deliver them earlier ? __eou__ I am afraid we can not do that . Would you be willing to sign an annual contract on the basis we discussed ? __eou__ Possibly , subject to quality and delivery guarantees . __eou__ Of course . Well , in that case we could offer a 5 % discount for a confirmed monthly order for the next 12 months . __eou__ I was looking forward to something a bit more substantial . As you know , we have long-time cooperation . __eou__ I'm afraid that's as far as we could go . We'd already be stretching ourselves to the limit . __eou__ Well , let's shake on that and draw up the details of the contract . __eou__
What would my new duties be ? __eou__ Your main responsibility is trouble-shooting between top management and the general employees . __eou__ Will I have the chance to take business trip abroad once in a while ? __eou__ Yes , you definitely will . __eou__
Mom , where are you going ? __eou__ I am going to buy some food to cook for supper . __eou__ Good . I wanna come with you . __eou__ How strange ! Our little emperor now asks to help out with shopping . __eou__ We learnt about vegetables and meat at school . But I never see the real thing . __eou__ Wow , that's something new . Let's go ! What's this , honey ? __eou__ Er , is it cabbage ? __eou__ Cabbage ? Is that what they teach at school now ? OK , honey , it's spinage . __eou__ Yeah , I know , this is Popeye's favorite food . __eou__ There we go . __eou__ Mom , come here . I know this , it is carrot , am I right ? __eou__ Bingo ! It's dark outside , Let's hurry up . __eou__
Hey honey ! Where were you ? __eou__ I decided to take Kenny to the park and get some fresh air . __eou__ How was it ? Were there a lot of kids ? __eou__ It wasn't too crowded , but we had a great time ! We got on the see-saw together , then went on a couple of different slides and then I tried to go with him in the jungle gym , but I didn't fit . __eou__ Sounds like fun ! When we go he always just likes to play in the sandbox . __eou__ Yeah , but today he was really hyper . He even got on the monkey bars and then he went on to go on the swings for a half hour . I'm exhausted ! __eou__ You should go to the park more often since you don't go to the gym anymore ! __eou__
There ’ s a big sale on clothes and sporting goods at Riverside Mall . __eou__ Sporting goods ? Is that bike Tim wanted on sale ? __eou__ Yeah , it ’ s 30 percent off the regular price . __eou__ Well , maybe we could get it now and hide it until his birthday . __eou__ Yeah , it ’ s a couple weeks away , and we don ’ t have anything yet . __eou__ Don ’ t buy him underwear again . He hates that . __eou__ I know , I know , but if I didn ’ t buy it for him , he ’ d never buy it . __eou__ See anything else we need there ? __eou__ Well , all shoes are 20 percent off . __eou__ Shoes ? You already have a closet full of shoes . __eou__ I know , but another pair can ’ t hurt . __eou__ Oh , all right . I need some new shirts , too . Let ’ s go after breakfast . __eou__
I've brought a little dog for Alice , girls usually like looking after pets . __eou__ Thank you , but Alice is only a visitor here . I don't know if she'll keep it . __eou__ To tell you the truth , the dog isn't my real reason for coming . I want to ask Alice if she'd like to be my girlfriend . __eou__ Really ? __eou__
Hah ! For three hours while you threw up . And Femi dumped me for that . I really loved her . __eou__ I'm so sorry , Taylor . Go talk to her . I'm sure she'd be happy to see you . __eou__ She probably wouldn't even recognize me . She's probably married . __eou__ Yi-jun said Femi was talking about you . So get out there , Tiger ! __eou__ Was she really ? So you're telling me there's a chance ? __eou__ Can't hurt to try . Carpe diem . Who can say if we'll be here tomorrow or not ? __eou__
Anita , I ’ Ve been here only three days and you ’ re leaving already . __eou__ Just for a few weeks . I need this vacation . You ’ ll be all right . You know the project we ’ re working on , and you ’ re a good scientist . Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll be back as soon as I spend or gamble all my money . __eou__ Gambling ? Where ? __eou__ Las Vegas . I find gambling relaxing . I don ’ t take it seriously , the way some people do . Besides , I love the shows and the all-night atmosphere of the town . The casinos never close , you know . __eou__ If you gamble all night , you ’ ll run out of money in a few days . __eou__
Why have you changed your job so frequently ? __eou__ My first job was in a well-established company where the division of labour was very clear . I do not have more chances to enrich my experience . Then I got an opportunity to really broaden my experience with a new company that was starting up , but unfortunately , they closed their service in three months ' time . I have worked in my present company for a considerable length of time and enjoy the job I am doing now , but I think I have accumulated enough experience to take up more challenging post in a much larger and diversified company where I could make solid contribution . __eou__
Hi , Monica , I am afraid I can ’ t make it to the office to punch out . __eou__ Where are you ? __eou__ I am still in XYZ Company , this meeting took longer than I expected . Say to it that the office manager knows I won ’ t be in to punch my card . __eou__ Ok . __eou__
I ’ d like to ask whether it is correct to partake in the firm ’ s insurance plan ? __eou__ If you want my advice , you won ’ t invite yourself any risk . __eou__ But people keep talking about the benefits from the plan . __eou__
Can I help you ? __eou__ I'm looking for a Sharp DVD Player . __eou__ Sure . Any particular model ? __eou__ Yes . The DS102 series . __eou__ Oh , I'm afraid we've sold out of those . They were really popular . __eou__ Will you be getting more in . __eou__ Yes . But not for about 2 weeks . __eou__
OK , Mr . Wu . You may come in . I'm Anne Smith and on my right , my colleague , Anna Duncan , and on my left , Angela Lamb . Do please sit down . __eou__ Thank you . Good afternoon Mrs . Smith , Miss Duncan , Miss Lamb . __eou__ Your English is fluent . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ How do you think of the weather today ? __eou__ I don't like the weather like this . Cold and rainy . Hope it become sunny as soon as possible . __eou__
Bill , Happy Halloween ! __eou__ Happy Halloween ! What creature are you going to dress up as ? __eou__ I will dress up as a vampire with big fangs . __eou__ May I have a look at your costume ? __eou__ Sure . Wait a moment . ( Several minutes later ) Here you are . __eou__ I like your black clothes and your fangs are cool . __eou__ I will bite many beautiful girls on the neck tonight . Maybe I will suck their blood . __eou__ Haha . Wish you good luck . __eou__
Two people were robbed last night near the park . __eou__ Again ? The area around the park is too dark at night . There should be more lights there . __eou__ I am afraid of the dark . I don ’ t feel safe in the dark . I feel someone is hiding in the dark to attack me . __eou__ Your feelings might be right . You should never walk alone there at night . It is too dangerous . __eou__ I Know . And you should be more careful , too . __eou__
Mary and Tom are breaking up . __eou__ It's unbelievable ! They are only married for one month . Then who is at fault ? __eou__ Mary said she couldn't put up with Tom , for he fell in love with another woman . __eou__ Do you think they'll become reconciled ? __eou__ No , I don't think so . She said she would rather be single than cope with an unhappy marriage . __eou__ What a shame ! Their marriage is really a mistake . __eou__
At their last meeting , the stockholders voted unanimously to block the merger of our company with Blycore . All the executive committee was in favor of the merger ... I don't understand how the stockholders could have so much power to throw a wrench in the plans ... __eou__ If they all unite on a certain issue , it's the stockholders who have the final say . You'd think it might be our CEO or the workers , but in fact , the stockholders control the money so they have the most power . __eou__ Is it really that simple ? It doesn't seem very efficient to run things that way ... __eou__ It might not be the most efficient , but if you think about it , it makes pretty good sense . The stockholders are our investors . They own the capital in our company , so they should have say about what is done with the company . __eou__ I guess I'd buy that ... __eou__
I'm more worried about snipers . __eou__ Snipers ? __eou__ Sniping is when someone makes a bid at the very last minute to steal something for a bargain price . __eou__ So you're afraid someone is going to snipe your Buddha ? __eou__ I heard about a software program called turbid . It automatically submits a bid with just a few seconds to go in an auction . __eou__ Count me out . I can do without shills and snipers and turbo-bidders . __eou__
We'd better cover the porcelain ware against All Risks . __eou__ All right . Our insurance coverage is 110 % of the invoice value , up to the port of destination only . __eou__ I'd like to have the insurance of the goods covered up to 130 % of the invoice amount . __eou__ Ok , this premium for the difference between 130 % and 110 % of the invoice value should be borne by the buyer . __eou__ That's understood . __eou__
How do you like the food here ? __eou__ I don't like it very much.But every-body likes their own food best . __eou__ There are many things I miss . You can't get the ingredients here . __eou__ Are you sure ? All the big cities have specialty shops , which sell all sorts of ethnic foods . __eou__ Perhaps . i just haven't had time to find them yet . __eou__
Why are you up so early , Mary ? __eou__ I'm still suffering from a little jetlag . __eou__ What are you watching ? __eou__ Saturday morning cartoons . __eou__ At least five channels have morning cartoons on Saturdays . __eou__ I think watching them is a great way to learn English . __eou__ I agree . And some cartoons are entertaining even for adults . __eou__ Yeah . Is Cindy up ? __eou__ Are you kidding ? It's too early for her . __eou__
Hello ! __eou__ Hello , Debbie . This is Donald . __eou__ Oh , hi , Donald . __eou__ What happened yesterday ? You forgot our date , didn ’ t you ? __eou__ Well , it rained hard all day and I had a bad cold , so I decided to stay home . __eou__ You did ? But I tried to call you at least twenty times and nobody answered . __eou__ Oh , the telephone lines were damaged by the storm . They repaired them yesterday . __eou__ What did David do yesterday ? Did he and Judy go dancing ? __eou__ No , they stayed home and played cards with the children . __eou__ And what did you do ? Did you play cards , too ? __eou__ No . I listened to records and studied , what did you do yesterday , Donald ? __eou__ I just told you , Debbie . I tried to call you twenty times ! __eou__
Don ’ t you have air-conditioning in your apartment ? It ’ s sweltering here ! __eou__ Well , there is air-conditioning . Did you see that window air conditioner there ? The problem is that the window unit isn ’ t powerful enough . __eou__ I guess not , huh . __eou__ Well , I ’ m going to move out anyway . The new apartment has central air-conditioning . __eou__ You should have moved out long , long ago . __eou__ Well , I had to wait until the lease expired . So ... __eou__ So how can you stand the heat ? __eou__ Well , I open the windows and ... and I ’ Ve got an electric fan ere . It helps a little . __eou__
Hello , Vicki . __eou__ Hi , David . What a beautiful necklace ! Dude , I ’ Ve never seen anything like it . __eou__ Well , you can have it for eleven hundred — as a friend . __eou__ I think seven hundred is enough . __eou__ What ? Seven hundred ? __eou__ Well , eight hundred , then ? __eou__ No , one thousand at least . __eou__ Eight hundred and fifty . Come on . I have 4 kids , 3 dogs , and 2 husbands to feed ! __eou__ You ’ re a thief , Vicki . But I guess , eight hundred and fifty is all right . __eou__ Here you are , sucker ! __eou__ Victory for me , I bought it for 30 bucks just yesterday ! __eou__
What's wrong , Dave ? You look down today . __eou__ I didn't pass the English exam . How to learn English well ? Can you give me some suggestions ? __eou__ Well , English is a " paper tiger " . Its natural enemy is adequate practice . __eou__ I have done a lot of reading comprehension exercises , and I also spend much time in memorizing English words . __eou__ I suggest you read English texts aloud every day , and try to speak more . That will be beneficial to cultivate your sense of the language . __eou__ Really ? I'll have a try . Maybe I will get high marks next time . __eou__
How do you shoot pool ? __eou__ You have 16 balls on the table , 7 solid colored , 7 striped colored , a black 8 ball , and the white ball . __eou__ And ? __eou__ You hit the white ball with your cue . The white ball hits the colored balls . And you want to get the colored balls into the pockets . __eou__ How do you know whether you should hit the solid or the striped one ? __eou__ At the beginning , it does not matter , but once someone gets one ball in , it is set . __eou__ Can I get the black ball in ? __eou__ The black ball has to be the final ball in the pockets . __eou__ Let's go and try now ! __eou__
Like a cat on hot bricks , as you might say . I don ’ t believe you are listening at all . __eou__ Sorry , I just worried about him . You know , he should be here an hour ago . __eou__ Don ’ t worry him , he has been grown up and I think he can take himself very well . __eou__ But he still does not come back . __eou__ Maybe he is on the way home now . __eou__
Oh , my ! It's really hot . I've never seen such scorching weather in my life . __eou__ Tell me about it ! It's like the whole world is broiling . __eou__ Oh , look at the thermometer ! The temperature has hit 98 . __eou__ I hope it's not gonna break into three digits __eou__ But it's already awfully close . __eou__ Well , I just hope it'll level off . __eou__ I guess you can ’ t do anything until after dark then . __eou__ I guess so . What else can we do ? You can ’ t stay in the heat for long . __eou__

Your flight leaves at Gate 7 , and we'll be boarding in about an hour and a half . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ Have a nice flight . __eou__

We should go to buy some fruit first . __eou__ It is heavy and not convenient to take them to the top . __eou__ How about taking a cantaloupe ? It is light and sweet . Children love it . __eou__ Good idea . We can buy some candy and nuts for children . __eou__ Yes . Look , cashew , peanuts , assorted biscuits , chocolate , canned goods , anything else ? __eou__ That's enough for the kids . Get some drinks . __eou__ Definitely beer . Two bottles . __eou__ Right .

Hello , Daisy , how are you doing ? __eou__ Fine , thank you . I haven ’ t seen you for quite some time . What have you been up to recently ? __eou__ I have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home , so you wouldn't have seen me . Recently , I've been obsessed with horror films . __eou__ Oh , how can you be infatuated with horror films ? They're so scary . __eou__ Yeah , you are right I used to not watch horror films , but after seeing Silence of the Lamb with Mike last month , I fell in love with them . __eou__ It's amazing . But if I were you , I wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one . __eou__ But it's really exciting . __eou__ Maybe , but I would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . I wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one . __eou__ Basically . you'll watch any type of movie except horror . __eou__ Yep . __eou__ I think you should have a try someday . Maybe you'll change your mind . __eou__ Maybe . After all , I am grown up now . __eou__
Did you see the picture of the guy on the front page of the newspaper this morning ? __eou__ No . I haven't had a chance to read the paper yet . __eou__ you've got to see it . It's an unbelievable picture ! __eou__ What's so interesting about it ? __eou__ Well , this guy fell asleep on the sofa and when he woke up , half his face had been bitten off ! __eou__ What ? How did that happen ? __eou__ They think his dog was trying to wake him up and couldn't , so ended up biting him in his face . __eou__ Wow . What does his look like now ? __eou__ It looks pretty frightening . He doesn't have any lips , so all you can see are his gums and teeth . Most of his nose and chin are missing too . __eou__ What did he look like before his dog bit his face off ? __eou__ He was actually quite handsome . What a shame . __eou__ What's he going to do now ? __eou__ It said that he's hoping to get a face transplant , but until then , he's looking forward to Halloween so he isn't the only one wearing a mask . __eou__
I will be accompanying you on your tour today to visit our company . This is the assembly line . These drawings on the wall are process sheets . They describe clearly how each process goes on to the next step . __eou__ How many workers are there on the lines ? __eou__ About 200 . They can assemble at least 3,000 computers every day . __eou__ Oh , it's highly efficient . __eou__ Yes , since I came to this company , I was told that high efficiency is essential for the further development . __eou__ How do you control the quality of the products ? __eou__ Well , all products have to go through five checks in the whole process . We believe that the quality is the soul of an enterprise . There fore , we always put quality as the first consideration . __eou__ Yes , quality is even more than the quantity . __eou__ Mr . Chandler , this way please . I will show you a five-minute multivision about the history of our company . __eou__
Our new production control program's going live on Monday . The old and the new programs will operate in tandem for four to six weeks . That should give us time to iron out any little problems . __eou__ Hope it all goes well . We're very busy at the moment and certainly don't want any problems at this time of year . __eou__ Yes , I realise that . We've spent a long time planning and preparing for the change-over . I'm confident we won't have any major problems . __eou__
Hi , Mary , you have been a secretary for several years in this company . Could you tell me what a secretary should do for a meeting or a conference ? __eou__ Well , an important part of the duties of a secretary , I think , is to do well the preparation work for the meeting . __eou__ What should a secretary do to prepare for a meeting ? Can you tell me a bit more about it ? __eou__ First of all , the agenda should be prepared before the meeting . Then you should ensure that those entitled to be present are properly informed . __eou__ I see , and how about the documents and the information ? __eou__ All the necessary documents and the information relevant to the meeting should be available , preferably printed and distributed before the meeting . __eou__ And what should a secretary do during the meeting ? __eou__ Of course , she should take minutes . __eou__ And after the meeting ? __eou__ After the meeting she should type the minutes up , and then keep proper records of the business transacted and the resolutions passed and also implement many of the decision reached at the meeting . __eou__ It's seriously good . __eou__
I cooked , so ... __eou__ Okay ! I'll do the dishes . __eou__
Help ! I'm about to drop these books . __eou__ I've got them . __eou__ Thanks ! __eou__

Happy couples need mutual understanding . __eou__

You're really fit , Paul . Do you exercise very much ? __eou__ Well , I almost always get up very early , and I lift weights for an hour . __eou__ You're kidding ! __eou__ No . And then I often go Rollerblading . __eou__ Wow ! How often do you exercise like that ? __eou__ About five times a week . What about you ? __eou__ Oh , I hardly ever exercise . I usually just watch TV in my free time . I guess I'm a real couch potato ! __eou__
Where is our son , dear ? __eou__ He is in his bedroom . He has been in a bad mood after school . __eou__ What happened ? Have you talked with him ? __eou__ Yeah . He told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor . __eou__
Mom ! __eou__ What are you doing ? __eou__ I'm playing with my new jump rope ! Watch this ! __eou__ You are sick , young lady . Get back in bed ! I called you in sick today , so you're going to lie down and fight that flu ! __eou__ But I feel better . __eou__ Then maybe you should go to school . If you're feeling so much better , you'll ace that English test , right ? __eou__ OK . I get it . I'm getting back into bed ... __eou__
Well , you know how important a clean house is to your grandma . __eou__ Yes , I hear about it every time she comes here . __eou__ She was the head janitor at St . Mary's Hospital for thirty years , after all . __eou__ I think she misses that job and wants to take it out on us . __eou__ You know , maybe she's just a neat freak . __eou__ I think she just likes to make us miserable . __eou__ You could be right . __eou__
Johnny , have you tidied up your room yet ? __eou__ Not yet , Mom . Why are you on such a cleanliness kick anyway ? __eou__ Do I have to remind you that your grandma is arriving tonight ? __eou__ Oh , my God , I forgot grandma's coming ! __eou__ Yes , so this place had better be clean . You know Grandma ... __eou__ ... I know I'll be killed if I pee on the toilet seat . __eou__ And Steve is going to look after you until we come back . __eou__
Hello , Bill.May I borrow your pen ? __eou__ Sure , which one ? The red one or the blue one ? __eou__ The blue one , please . __eou__ You may keep it for the time being . I'm not using it now . __eou__
Hey ! Ask your mom for more old pictures , OK ? __eou__ Can't it wait ? She's still angry that we sent e-mail wedding invitations . __eou__ But we saved your parents so much money ... __eou__ I know . And they're spending enough on the plane tickets to Texas ! __eou__ Speaking of plane tickets , don't forget to check on the reservations ! __eou__ OK . __eou__
Only one . But I wanted to make sure I'd get it . __eou__ Yeah , I really wanted that Chanel bag , too . But just in case you should bid low . __eou__ But there are only two more days until the bidding closes ! __eou__ I bid on a Chanel watch at the last minute , and got it sixty percent off ! __eou__ Oh ... I'm such a newbie . But at least I'm sure I'll get that tennis racket . __eou__ Don't count on it , Babe . eBay is always full of surprises . __eou__ Well ... guess how low the bidding starts on the tennis racket ? __eou__
But what if I don't win what I bid on ? __eou__ Then it wasn't meant to be . Some people have put up a hard fight for some items I bid on . But I was the sole bidder for this bag and got it dirt-cheap . __eou__ It seems that you can e-mail the seller and ask questions . __eou__ Sure . I've even e-mailed some people who had bought from the person who sold this bag . __eou__ And people are honest ? __eou__ They said he was an honest and professional businessman . But that's the exciting part . It's kind of like gambling ... __eou__
Hi , I'm back ! Hmm ... your hair is pretty damaged , and you've got split ends . __eou__ Really ? What can I do ? __eou__ Well , the trim should fix the split ends , but you might need a deep conditioning treatment . __eou__ Umm , OK . Whatever you think will help . __eou__ I'm also going to add some layers to frame your face . __eou__ Can you use the thinning shears on top , too ? My hair is really thick . __eou__ No problem ! __eou__ Hi , I'm back ! Hmm ... your hair is pretty damaged , and you've got split ends . __eou__ Really ? What can I do ? __eou__ Well , the trim should fix the split ends , but you might need a deep conditioning treatment . __eou__ Umm , OK . Whatever you think will help . __eou__ I'm also going to add some layers to frame your face . __eou__ Can you use the thinning shears on top , too ? My hair is really thick . __eou__ No problem ! __eou__
Wow . She can be really nasty , can't she ? __eou__ No . She was right . I was too nervous . I kept thinking , What if we blow it ? __eou__ Well , I guess Zina figured you couldn't blow it if you were in the hotel room . __eou__ She even stayed at a different hotel . She said I might be contagious . __eou__ Well , at least we have Stars.com . That'll be great publicity . __eou__
I've been standing here since half past seven . Where on earth have you been ? __eou__ I'm terribly sorry I'm late . I just couldn't help it . __eou__ It's really very easy saying you're sorry . __eou__ Look , just give me a chance . I can explain it . __eou__
What ? I don't get it ... __eou__ Many of the slower dances are danced to the lyrics of tragedies . He meant that you turned it into a comedy . __eou__ Well , I'm glad I made everyone happy . __eou__ He meant it in a good way . You added a little spice to the performance . __eou__ I'm glad you guys all have such a good sense of humor . Ha-ha ... __eou__ Of course ! That's why I always say , Eat , drink and be Greek ! __eou__
Mrs.Smith , time has stood still with you ! __eou__ Thank you.You ' re partial . __eou__ I'm not flattering you.You ' re full of energy every day . __eou__ It's nice to hear that anyway . __eou__
What's wrong with him ? __eou__ His nose is out of joint because we forgot to invite him to the party . __eou__

Don't be shy . Have some more chicken . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
I'm feeling hungry . __eou__ Isn't it time for dinner ? __eou__ Yes , let's get something to eat . __eou__ How about Mac Donald's ? __eou__
We'll get a big bonus this year , won't we ? __eou__ Don't count on it . __eou__
I want to have Mexican food for dinner . __eou__ I'm tired of Mexican food . Besides , you picked the restaurant last week . __eou__ OK , you win . You pick the restaurant this time . __eou__
Hi , Jim and Wendy . Where're you going ? __eou__ We're going to that new restaurant for lunch . Would you like to join us ? __eou__
Does your child still believe in Santa Claus ? __eou__ Yes . She believes everything about him . __eou__ How sweet . __eou__ Yes . If she doesn't believe it , Christmas won't be so exciting to her . __eou__ When are you going to tell her that Santa Claus doesn't exist ? __eou__ I'm not going to tell her . She will find out and understand when she grows older . __eou__
Merry Christmas , Linda ! __eou__ Merry Christmas , Lee ! __eou__ Linda , thank you for this wonderful Christmas dinner . I really enjoyed it . __eou__ Thank you for coming . I'm glad you liked it . __eou__
The police need our help finding a robber . __eou__ How do you know ? __eou__ The TV news is reporting a bank robbery . __eou__ Do they know what the robber looks like ? __eou__ Yes , he's 6 feet tall , 200 pounds , black hair , and about 30 years old . __eou__ What race is he ? __eou__ They didn't say . __eou__ The TV news doesn't tell us the race anymore . __eou__ Of course not . That would be racist . __eou__ But how can we identify someone if we don't know their race ? __eou__ Don't ask me . __eou__ Then they also shouldn't tell us if the robber is male or female , because that is sexist . __eou__
Have you been to Shanghai before ? __eou__ Yes I have . I ’ Ve been there three times in the past year . __eou__ That sounds great . Have you been to the top of the Pearl Tower ? __eou__ No I haven ’ t . I haven ’ t visited the Bund either . I ’ Ve always had too much work to do . __eou__ So you haven ’ t done much then , in Shanghai ? __eou__ Actually , I ’ Ve eaten soup dumplings in a lovely restaurant on Nanjing Lu . They were delicious ! __eou__
You are in love with Mary , right ? __eou__ You are pulling my legs ! __eou__ I am not blind . Anyone can see that with half an eye . __eou__
He was hauled up last week for the second time . __eou__ You mean he had been put in prison before . __eou__ Of course , he is a man with a history . __eou__ Oh , he had fooled me . __eou__
I'm very grateful for what you have done to my son , doctor . __eou__ That's all tight , Mr.Smith.That ' s my job . I'm very glad he recovered so soon . __eou__ I know he has brought great trouble to you . A million thanks . __eou__ No trouble at all . He's very cute and brave . By the way , do remember to keep him away from sea food for at least two weeks . __eou__ I will . It's most thoughtful of you . __eou__
May , we are fools to hang out at noon . It's dying hot today . My skin is too weak to be exposed under the summer sun . __eou__ Do you have any sunscreen lotion ? __eou__ You know , honey , I used it all on the way over . __eou__ I think I'm getting a heart stroke . __eou__ The heat is driving crazy and I hate my new hat . __eou__ Why ? It's brand new , and it's perfect on you . __eou__ But I bought it to get rid of the heat . Now it does nothing but burning my head . __eou__ Beauty costs , honey . __eou__ Laugh all you want , whatever . We need to get out of the heat . __eou__ Walking under the sun is certainly not the way . __eou__ Give me a break . It's not funny . __eou__ Right . Sorry . Anyway , the radio said that it'll rain later today . __eou__ Hope so ! Good thing is that autumn is just around the corner . __eou__
You want to go with him ? __eou__ Yes ? __eou__ Then you must be off your head . He is a real bastard . __eou__
Do you like watching TV ? __eou__ Yes I do , usually . __eou__ What do you exactly mean by usually ? __eou__ I don't like spending time on commercials.There ' re too many commercials on TV . __eou__
I have something really cool to tell you about ! Do you know anything about online auctions ? __eou__ Not really . __eou__ They're awesome ! I was browsing through the eBay auction today , and I found the cutest fat little copper Buddha ! It's over a hundred years old . __eou__ Please don't tell me you bought it . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ If you did , you probably got ripped off . __eou__
So what did you think about the movie ? __eou__ Well , I think this Star Wars episode is an excellent piece of work , but not as good as the previous ones . __eou__ Really ? I don't agree . This Star Wars episode was incredible ! __eou__ Why do you think so ? __eou__ Well , one of the most spectacular things about this one was the special effects . State of the art special effects are the main reason for the success of previous episodes , so audiences have high expectations for this one , and I don't think they will be disappointed . __eou__ You are right . The special effects were amazing . And I like the fact that they created so many fantastic settings and otherworldly costumes , weapons and creatures . __eou__ It's kind of cool that they are still using the same Star Wars theme song for this movie . __eou__ Yeah ! It reminds me of the previous Star Wars scenes . __eou__ I know exactly what you mean . Hearing that song gives me a nostalgic feeling . __eou__ I thought the overall plot of the movie was very interesting , but I don't think the character development was that strong . __eou__ Do you think that they had anything to do with the casting of the movie ? __eou__ No , the casting is great and the actors were excellent . They just didn ’ t have a lot of funny or meaningful dialogues . The writing was also a little weak . __eou__ Well , maybe . But I like the little kid who played Manakin Skywalker . I can't imagine anyone else playing that role . __eou__ I liked him too . He is so cute ! You know , even though I was slightly disappointed , I can't wait for the next episode . I wonder when they ’ re going to start making it and when it ’ s scheduled for release ? __eou__ I've no idea . But looking at the success of Star Wars episode , I've a strong feeling production for the next episode will be selling pretty soon . I hope It will be even better than this one . __eou__ I hope so , too . __eou__ Well , I think we should go now . It's getting pretty late . __eou__ Okay , let's go ! __eou__
I can drink ten cups in fifteen minutes . I ’ m sure . __eou__ You ? You are full of hot air . __eou__
Who's better at chess , Bill or Fred ? __eou__ Both are superb in their skills.Anyhow , Fred is one up on Bill from my point of view . __eou__ You said it . __eou__
Who's the champion in this picture ? __eou__ Let me show you , the one with curly hair . __eou__ He's very handsome , I think . __eou__
Why weren't you at school yesterday ? __eou__ I wasn't feeling really well . __eou__ What was wrong with you ? __eou__ My stomach was upset . __eou__ Do you feel better now ? __eou__ I don't really feel too well yet . __eou__ Do you want anything to make you feel better ? __eou__ No , thanks . I already took some medicine . __eou__ I hope you feel better . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
I hear you are planning to travel abroad . __eou__ Yes . I'm going to the Untied States for travel . What places do you recommend ? __eou__ In my opinion , there are several places you mustn't miss , like Washington D . C , Las Vegas , New York and Los Angeles . __eou__ Someone suggests that I should go to Seattle and Hawaii . __eou__ Yes , you may consider those two places also . Seattle , for example , is worth visiting and there's a very famous museum called Museum of Flight . __eou__ And Seattle is the home of Microsoft and Boeing . That must be a great place . I can't miss it . __eou__
Could I have your name , please ? __eou__ Kevin Belknap . __eou__ How do you spell your last name ? __eou__ B-E-L-K-N-A-P . __eou__ Right . Thank you very much ! __eou__
Do you have the letter of approval of employment ? __eou__ No , I haven't got one . My employment petition hasn't been approved yet . __eou__ In that case , you are not allowed to work in China , until you get the employment petition . __eou__ Ok , I see . __eou__
My pal , you are so nervous recently . You don't need to be like that . __eou__ I am worried about that Arden will display all my drawbacks in the performance review . That will be embarrassing . __eou__ Just use your head . If you were definitely making some big mistakes , you would be informed . __eou__ I had a nightmare last night and I dreamt Arden told me that my performance fell short of his expectation . I was terrified to wake up after hearing that . __eou__ That is merely a dream . Remember , there is always room for us to have further improvement . I think we did the good job in the whole period . __eou__ I know what you are talking about . The performance evaluation process starts from the day we're hired . There is no surprise during the actual review . __eou__
I think your presentation impressed the client , Daniel . You did a good job . __eou__ Thank you , Mr . Cooper . I hope we get the contract . __eou__

I'll listen to the client patiently , and accept the criticism objectively . Then I will have the claim reasonably settled . __eou__
Were you late for work this morning ? __eou__ Yes , I was . I was almost an hour late . __eou__ What did you say to your boss ? __eou__ I said I was terribly sorry . But he said it was quite all right . __eou__ Your boss was really nice . __eou__ No , he didn't scold me because he was late , too . __eou__
What did you do at that company ? __eou__ I helped my boss organize some grand ceremonies and maintained close relations with newspapers , magazines , the radio and the TV . __eou__ If a consumer complains about the quality of your products , what will you do ? __eou__ If I am not in the service center , I will assist others in resolving the consumer complaints . And pass the criticism on to the relevant department . __eou__
That is what we are pursuing . __eou__ We look forward to a further extension of our pleasant business relations . __eou__ A meeting will be arranged to negotiate the relevant stuff . __eou__ That will be good . __eou__
Hello Mike ! Would you like a drink ? __eou__ No , thank you . I had too much to drink yesterday evening . I had a bad hangover this morning . My head felt terrible . __eou__ Were you celebrating something ? __eou__ Yes . It was a friend ’ s birthday party . We drank all kinds of things-beer , wine and spirits . After midnight , we were even drinking cocktails ! __eou__ It ’ s a bad idea to drink a combination of alcoholic drinks . You should stick with one for the whole evening . __eou__ I know , but it was a celebration , you Kwon ? I don ’ t think I ’ Ve see you drunk . __eou__ I usually only drink beer and I rarely drink more than a few pints . __eou__ You are a sensible drinker . Anyway , I ’ m not going to drink any alcohol this evening . I don ’ t ’ want another bad hangover . __eou__ Let me buy you a soft drink then . How about a coke ? __eou__ Yeah . That ’ s a good idea . I heard that coke was first used as a medicine . __eou__ Rally ? ... barman ! ... a large coke with ice and lemon , please ... thanks . Here ’ s the money . __eou__ Are you going to the wine tasting tomorrow ? __eou__ Yes . I thought it might be interesting to learn a little about wine ... __eou__ ... and taste a few ! There will be wines from several countries and an expert to give advice on which wines are good and which ones are not . __eou__ Yes . I ’ m looking forward to it . __eou__
Mary , please go to the door . I hear the bell . __eou__ It's the mailman , Mother . Here's a letter from Uncle George . __eou__ Give it to me ... How wonderful ! He's coming to visit us . __eou__ When's he coming ? __eou__ He's coming by car on the twenty-fourth . He's staying from thetwenty-fourth to the twenty-sixth . __eou__ Let me look at the calendar . Good ! The twenty-fourth is a Saturday . Is he coming alone ? __eou__ No , he's coming with Aunt Cynthia and the girls . __eou__ Mother , I don't remember the girls . How old are they ? __eou__ Your cousin Fay is fifteen . Rosemary is older than Fay . She's seventeen . __eou__ Are they going to stay here with us ? __eou__ Of course . The girls can stay in your room with you . __eou__ Mother , may we have a party ? __eou__ If you like , but now we have to think about meals and many other things . __eou__ Prepare the list , Mother . I can go shopping . I can go to the small stores.Everyone knows me there . __eou__
You are going to work as my office secretary from next Monday . Right now I want to show you the rules of our company . __eou__ Thank you for your instruction . I really need to know the rules before I play the game , so I can know more about our company . __eou__ The working hours are from 9:00 to 11:30 in the morning and from 1:30 to 5:30 in the afternoon . Make sure never to be late or absent . Every time you should use the employee card to show you are present whenever you come into the company . __eou__ Set your heart at rest . I keep this in my mind . __eou__ In my opinion , a secretary must be familiar with office routine and try to do some things by you . This is the filing cabinet and any document or file you may need . And you should file these documents in alphabetical order . __eou__
Good morning , and welcome to Live Tech . It is my honor to make this presentation for you . Let me begin by explaining some of our digital cameras ' selling points . You will see immediately that they are very stylish , but what you can't see is the cutting-edge technology inside . All of our cameras are light , compact , and easy to use . __eou__ Can I take a look at one of those ? __eou__ Be my guest . Live Tech's digital cameras combine point-and-shoot simplicity with the ability to easily turn pictures into great-looking prints . Furthermore , it allows users to transfer pictures to a computer while the camera recharges . __eou__ Can I take a picture of you ? Seeing is believing . __eou__ Sure , Just push the button , like ... __eou__ I think I can figure this out . Let's see if this works as advertised . Say ' cheese ! ' __eou__ I think you will find these are the best digital cameras on the market today . __eou__ I think the quality of the photos will speak for themselves . __eou__
hi , Betty.what ' s up ? __eou__ nothing special . how about you ? Are you used to the life here in the States ? __eou__ everything has been fine for the past several months . __eou__ great ! __eou__ well , I wish someone could talk to me about Western table manners __eou__ sounds interesting . Where did you get the idea ? __eou__ as you know , table manners in China are quite different from those of Westerners . __eou__ absolutely . that's because both of us have distinctive cultural features . __eou__ for example , in China , it's okay to talk while eating . However , you may regard it as rude . __eou__ yes . this must be a huge difference . __eou__ can you think of anything else ? __eou__ sure . We tend to think that the slower on eats , the more polite one seems . __eou__ I didn't know that before . __eou__ and we never sip or slurp the soup loudly . we quietly like little mouthfuls . __eou__ i got it . i'll bear it in mind . __eou__ don't worry . i'm sure our etiquette will become a natural part of your behavior as time goes by . __eou__ I hope so . __eou__
Let's see . I had the salmon starter which was £ 5.90 and my Pizza was £ 8.25 . __eou__ I had the soup and bruschetta which all together is £ 4.50 and my trout for the main course was £ 12 . __eou__ So that's £ 14.15 for me and £ 16.50 for you . __eou__ Yes and shall we go fifty-fifty for the wine ? __eou__ Yes , so that's an extra £ 6 for both of us . __eou__ So now your bill comes to £ 20.15 and I need to pay £ 22.50 . __eou__ And I had a dessert - that's another £ 3.50 . And you had coffee which is £ 2 . __eou__ And is that all ? __eou__ Yes , this is everything on the list . __eou__ So now my bill is £ 24.50 and yours come to £ 23.65 . Is that correct ? __eou__ Yes , that's exactly it . How much tip shall we give the waiter ? __eou__ I think £ 5 would be good . __eou__
Have you heard that Tom and his wife divorced ? __eou__ I didn't hear that . But I can deduce the reason . __eou__ Really ? Say it ! __eou__ Tom is a kind guy , but addicted to gambling . He spends all his time gambling in the casino . And his wife can't put up with his incessant gambling any longer , so she divorced him . Is that right ? __eou__ Yeah , quite right . Gambling broke up a happy family . __eou__ Yeah ! Gambling is often a curse . By gambling we lose time and treasure , two things most precious to a man . __eou__ Besides that , many people took to gambling and got in over their heads , and gradually ruined themselves . __eou__ In a word , gambling is a vice . We should be away from it . __eou__
Annie , what is troubling you ? You look unhappy . __eou__ A man is pursuing me . He was my schoolmate in college , and he has been carrying a torch for me for three years . __eou__ Do you like him ? __eou__ Yes , I do like him . __eou__ Then why are you hesitating ? __eou__ You know that I have had a series of miserable relationships . Last summer , I fell in love with John . But the romance blossomed for six or seven weeks , and then wilted . __eou__ One love drives out another . You shouldn't be afraid to start a new relationship . __eou__ Maybe you are right . __eou__
It sounds that you have a high opinion of him . __eou__ He is an all-right guy . I have no bone to pick with him . __eou__ Birds of feather flock together . __eou__ But he is not a fine wether friend who could sell you down the river . __eou__ You cannot judge a person that way . I have a hunch that he is a sly dog . __eou__ Depends on with whom . He may be doing things on the sly , but he is honest with me . I trust him . __eou__ You can never tell . He might do you in when he sees an angle in doing it . __eou__
How do you know ? I thought Taiwanese people didn't have garage sales . __eou__ You're right . We're not really into used stuff . __eou__ Well , I've grown to like second-hand things . I wouldn't have gotten through university without them ! __eou__ There aren't many places that sell used things in Taiwan , besides auction websites . __eou__ I use those sites . Hey ! Let's go check out a flea market later . __eou__ Great ! I can teach you men a thing or two about shopping ! __eou__
Television is undoubtedly a great invention , but one of the main criticisms of it is that people just aren't selective enough . Lesley , got a television . how do you pick out the sorts ofprogrammes you want to watch ? __eou__ I try and look at the programmes that are on to decide which particular ones interest me , rather than you turning it on a seven o'clock and you leaving it on until half-past eleven when the programmes finish . __eou__ Do you think of television though as a great time-waster ? __eou__ Un ... I think it can be a time-waster and it depends on how particular people are about what they want to see ... Mm , it can just be a sort total amusement for someone and totally consuming without reallyconsidering what it is they're watching . __eou__ Aha , but how do you prevent it coming into your life and taking oversour evenings and at the same time perhaps get . . . get out of thetelevision some of the sort of best things ... best programmes that ... that undoubtedly are on television ? __eou__ Well , I suppose one of the problems is ... will depend on what a person's life style is , and that if he has other outside interests which are equally important to him as television , he will then , you know , hmm . be more careful about which programme she wants to watch because he has time which he wants to use for other things . __eou__ Do you think though that ... that in . . . in a sense television skilled people's own er ... sort of , creativity or their ability entertain themselves because if they're bored all they do is justturn on the television ? __eou__ Yes , I think that is a danger , and I think that . . in fact is what mishappening to a lot of people who use it as their ... their main ... um field of amusement and ... because they don't have other outside interests and even when people come round they'll leave the television and not be , you know , particularly interested in talking to them , you Know the television will be the main thing in the room . __eou__
It's a beautiful day , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , isn't it . __eou__ Do you now the temperature today ? __eou__ It's beautiful 75 degrees . __eou__ How nice . I hope the weather will stay like this for the whole week . I'm going on the canoe trip this weekend . __eou__ Not a good plan . The TV weather forecast says the hurricane is coming this weekend , and the temperature will also drop to 66 degrees . __eou__ What a nuisance ! Every time I plan to go canoeing or camping , a storm comes along . The sky gets dark , the wind starts to howl and the temperature drops.Well , I'd better stay home . __eou__ I never make any definite weekend plan until Friday morning . Then after listening to the weather temperature , I make my plans . __eou__ That's smart . I'm going to start doing the same thing . __eou__
Daddy , how are you going to spend your weekends ? __eou__ I need to finish my research paper . __eou__ Could you go with me to climb Kiang Shan ? __eou__ Honey , I am sorry I have no time . __eou__ Oh , Daddy , you should do more exercise . You are getting a little heavy . __eou__ I am afraid you are right . Recently , even going upstairs makes me out of breath . __eou__ Then go climbing with me , Daddy . Mountain climbing can build your muscles like Popeyes . __eou__ Terrific ! It is also a good exercise to keep me fit . __eou__ I give you my word , you must feel refreshed after mountain climbing . __eou__ OK , I'll go . __eou__ That's a deal . __eou__ Sure . __eou__
My mother bought me a new video game . __eou__ What's it like ? __eou__ Well , the hero is a Super Warrior . He has to fight the bad guys to find the treasure . __eou__ Who are the bad guys ? __eou__ There are a lot ! Two really bad ones are Giant Monster and Human Spider . __eou__ Wow ! Where's the treasure ? __eou__ It's in a dungeon , under a castle . __eou__ How do you find it ? __eou__ It's not easy to find . Anyway , you can come to my home after school today and try . __eou__ Great ! __eou__
Good evening , madam . May I help you ? __eou__ I want a facial . But this is the first time I've come here , so can you tell me how you do it ? __eou__ Sure . Most facials start with a thorough cleaning . Then we usually use a toner to invigorate the skin , followed by exfoliation treatment-a peeling mask or scrub that removes the dead cells that make the skin lock dull . After that , we'll massage your face and neck with oil or cream to improve the circulation and relieve the tension , followed by a mask to moisturize and soften the skin . __eou__ That's exactly what I want . How long does it take ? __eou__ We have half-hour and one-hour treatments . __eou__ What's the regular price ? __eou__ Well , the half-hour facial costs 50 yuan and the one-hour costs 80 yuan . If you want make-up , another 20 yuan will do . __eou__ Good , I will take the one hour facial with make-up . __eou__ That's fine , madam . __eou__ By the way , could you give me a manicure ? Use a light nail-polish , please . __eou__ Yes , madam . __eou__
Can your dog do any tricks ? __eou__ Sure he can . He can shake hands , roll over , and even play dead . __eou__ I wish I had a dog . My cat can't do any tricks . __eou__ Yeah , but sometimes Bingo wants to play with me , but I don't have time . __eou__ So who takes care of him then ? __eou__ My little brother likes to play with him . He even gives him a bath every week . __eou__ I can't do that with my cat . She hates water . __eou__ You know , you're right . Maybe you should get a dog . __eou__
Bob , put on your shoes , your feet are really smelly . __eou__ No foot gives out scent . __eou__ But don't forget you are in a cafe . __eou__ Never mind , the odour of my feet will quicken their eating speed . __eou__ I simply can't bear your barbaric behavior . __eou__ Don ’ t pretend you are a good God . __eou__ You should feel shameful for your behavior . __eou__ I've never experienced such a kind of feeling . __eou__ I'm really sick of you . __eou__
How do you like this dress ? __eou__ It's nice . But what kind of dress are you looking for ? __eou__ Something attractive and dressy . Maybe a little sexy too . New Year's Eve is a special occasion and it only happens once a year , right ? __eou__ Of course . It's common too that we wear something special for our Chinese New Year . __eou__ People here always wear the best clothes they have . Many people go out and buy clothes especially for New Year's Eve . __eou__ Any other common customs of your New Year ? __eou__ Before the New Year , we always send greeting cards to our relatives and friends to wish them a happy year . On the street and in stores people usually greet others with a ' Happy New Year ' . It's also common for people to make a New Year's resolution . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ It's when people quit a bad habit or do something they find hard to do . Many people resolve to quit smoking , lose weight , or stop nagging their wife , etc . However , it usually lasts only for a few days ! __eou__ By the way , where are you going on New Year's Eve ? __eou__ We're going to a night club for dinner and dancing , then we'll go down to the city square for the big celebration . There's always a fireworks display put on by the local government . We all want you to come too . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__
It seems to me that you are on very good terms with him . __eou__ We actually met at a dance party . He fell for me . __eou__ He must be all over you the first time he saw you . __eou__ He said that I put all other girls in the shade . __eou__ That means he was head over heels in love with you . __eou__ Well , he indeed likes me . __eou__ But I think he can't hold a candle to you . I don't think he has ever popped the question . __eou__ No , he is the sort of man who likes to hide his candle under a bushel . __eou__
Guess who I saw yesterday ? __eou__ Who ? __eou__ My cousin Monk . Have you seen her lately ? __eou__ Not for a couple of years . What happened to her ? __eou__ Nothing exactly . She's grown into a very attractive young lady . __eou__ Oh , she is . __eou__ You know , her long lovely blond hair and beautiful blue eyes really make her stand out from others . __eou__ Not surprising . I bet she's very tall and slim . __eou__ Yean . Around five feet five inches tall . __eou__
Hi Steve . What do you think of the new supplier ? __eou__ We haven't had any problems so far . They offer a 24 - hour technical back-up service . We've called them in three times this month . They always arrive within a couple of hours . __eou__ That's good service . Do we have to pay extra for that ? __eou__ No . There's no call-out fee . It's included in the annual service contract . __eou__
Did you see the letter I got from Bradford Films ? They sent it in response to your phone call last week . __eou__ If they wanted to say something about my call last week , why didn ’ t they sand it to me ? __eou__ I guess they must not have your contact information , so they sent it addressed in care of your department head . Anyhow , they wrote to confirm in writing what you discussed about the Milton contract . __eou__ Can I see it for a second ? __eou__ Sure , here it is ... __eou__ Dear Mr . Clark , Further to our telephone call last Friday , I am writing to confirm our meeting on july 21 . As we discusses , our meeting is to review the contract details . __eou__ Did they ask you to send the files beforehand ? __eou__ Let ’ s see , ” we would e grateful if you could please send related materials to our office prior to our meeting . ” It looks like ... hey , was there anything else sent along with this letter ? __eou__ I don't think so , why do you ask ? __eou__ The letter reads , “ please find enclosed a copy of our agenda for your review . ” I don ’ t see anything else in the envelope ... __eou__ Maybe they forgot to attach it to the letter . You should give them another call . __eou__
Susan , Is the manager in this office ? __eou__ Yes . But he is meeting a client . __eou__ Oh , that's too bad . I just got a phone call saying that my wife is now in the hospital . She is going to deliver a baby . I must take the day off to go to the hospital . May I talk to him to ask for leave ? __eou__ I am afraid not , but I think I could convey your leave to him after the client goes . __eou__ Oh , that's very kind of you . Thank you very much . I've got to go . __eou__
Sorry to bother you sir , but I have some bad news . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ Well , the stock market just took a huge plunge and we ’ Ve lost a lot of money ! __eou__ What do you mean ? What happened ? __eou__ There are many factors that weigh in , but NASDAQ is down 200 points , the DOW JONES indicator also suffered ! Our portfolio is worth half of what it was worth points week ago . __eou__ How is this possible ? You are supposed to be talking to our stockbrokers and making sure that our securities and investments are safe and making a profitable return ! __eou__ I know sir ! We didn ’ t expect a bull market to become a bear market all of a sudden . On the other hand , you still have some high yield trash bonds and government bonds that will give us enough liquidity to cut our loses and reinvest in emerging markets . We could potentially make this tragedy work for us and make us think outside the box . __eou__ Do what you have to do ! One other thing , don ’ t tell the rest of the stockholders about this . If they find out , it ’ s the end of this company ! __eou__
Julia , Julia , Julia . My daring Julia , what's wrong with you ? __eou__ Steven , are you talking to me ? __eou__ Yes , I have called you three times . What makes you in a daze ? __eou__ I was thinking about the accident I saw in the morning . I was petrified when two cars collided . I witnessed the traffic accident . __eou__ Did someone get hurt ? __eou__ A driver died instantly . The other one was badly hurt . A poor boy called Peter was killed in the accident too . __eou__ What a terrible accident ! Who should be responsible for this traffic accident ? __eou__ I think both . They drove too fast . What's worse , one of them was drunk . __eou__ Why do some guys like to drive so fast when they are drunk ? __eou__ I don ’ t understand . Maybe they feel they are okay and driving fast seems very cool . __eou__
Before we begin eating , I'd like to present everyone with a gift from Taiwan . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ It's a Taiwanese puppet doll . __eou__ It's huge ! __eou__ Yeah . They're usually this big . __eou__ The craftsmanship is excellent . __eou__ All the parts work . __eou__ Thank you so much . __eou__ Don't mention it . __eou__
Hi , Janice . Our first weekend after being employed is coming . Show me your plan . __eou__ My mom phoned me this morning , and asked me to go back home to have housework chores . __eou__ What are you assigned to do ? __eou__ God knows . Speaking of chores , I would rather do some washing than cooking . __eou__ For me , I think I will iron my shirt and trousers . Actually , weekends tend to be the most hectic day in the whole week . __eou__ I really hope that I could sleep like a log all through two nights . But ... Some one said that weekends are a bit like rainbows ; they look good from a distance but disappear before we get up close to them . __eou__ I couldn't agree more . __eou__
It is so quiet here . I like the place . __eou__ Me too . __eou__ I can't stand the loud noise in the city . __eou__ Yes , sometimes I can hardly get asleep at night . __eou__ I hope I can stay here longer . __eou__ When will your vacation end ? __eou__ The day after tomorrow . __eou__ You will go back tomorrow , right ? __eou__ Yes , you are right . __eou__
Sometimes you look like brains , and sometimes you are simple a Barbie Doll . __eou__ I don ’ t know whether I am a Barbie Doll or you are one . __eou__ Maybe I am a Barbie Doll , but I won ’ t do Barbie Doll things . __eou__ Well , I am not going to flog a dead horse . Let get down to our brass tasks and tidy these things up . __eou__
Old Dyson looks as if he maybe kick the bucket any day . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ I ’ Ve ever seen a living being looked so thin . __eou__ Really ? In my eyes it ’ s normal , as an old man , to be thin is better than to be fat . __eou__ Maybe you are right . __eou__
How did you enjoy your family party at “ ginger ’ s ” ? I hear that they have a lovely menu and buffet . __eou__ Oh , it was great . We had seafood buffet . They do one every Friday . The waiters and waitresses are very good . They are very attentive , but don ’ t hang around the table . __eou__ I like the buffets they have , but if often order a la carte , because I don ’ t feel extremely hungry . I like the wine list there too . __eou__ Yes , so do I . they have wines from all over the world . There is a good range of prices to suit every pocket . We ordered some Australian red wine , which tasted delicious and wasn ’ t expensive . __eou__ Some restaurants allow you to take your own wine and just charge you corkage , but the don ’ t do that at “ ginger ’ s ” . what was included in the seafood buffet ? __eou__ They had almost every kind of seafood . There were oyster , shrimp , prawns , crabs , and fish . I ate a lot of smoked salmon . __eou__ Did they have lobster ? __eou__ No , they didn ’ t . you could order it from the menu . I think that lobster is too expensive to be included in the buffet . __eou__ Yes , it probably is . I don ’ t like ordering oysters in restaurants . You never know whether they are fresh . __eou__ I know . I didn ’ t eat any , but a few people in our group did and no one got sick . __eou__ When you eat out , do you usually eat from the buffet ? __eou__ Not usually . I usually just order a main course and have a dessert if I ’ m still hungry afterwards . __eou__ Oh , you don ’ t usually have a starter ? __eou__ No , I might have a soup if it ’ s a cold winter day . __eou__
You look so tan and healthy ! __eou__ Thanks . I just got back from summer camp . __eou__ How was it ? __eou__ Great . I got to try so many things for the first time . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ I went sailing , fishing , and horseback riding . __eou__ I ’ m so jealous . __eou__ The counselors were so nice too . It was the best summer ever . Except for all those mosquitoes ! __eou__
Ladies and gentlemen , we are heading towards the first spot of our trip-the Louvre . __eou__ Wonderful . That's a place famous for its arts . __eou__ Yes . There are so many famous paintings on show . I am sure it will be an unforgettable trip . __eou__ Surely it will be . By the way , when will we get there ? __eou__ Half an hours later . __eou__
What sights are included on the tour ? Is the entire time spent in Paris ? __eou__ All of the major sights are included . You'll visit the Louvre , the Eiffel Tower and all of the top museums . You'll also take a day trip out of Paris to Versailles . __eou__ Can you fax a copy of the tour itinerary to me ? __eou__ Of course . Just give me your fax number . __eou__ It's 212-331-7600 . __eou__ Okay . I'll fax the itinerary to you immediately . __eou__
Your silk garments have aroused much interest in our country ever since our first order was put on the market . We have no doubt we can do better this year if you appoint us your sales agent . __eou__ We appreciate your intention , but the amount of your orders last year was moderate . __eou__ That's true . However at the Fair last March , people were so interested in Chinese garments that the demand this year will surely increase . __eou__ Do you think it will help if we appoint a local agent ? __eou__ I'm sure it will , if we are appointed your agent . Your garments are attractive , and we , a well-established importer with multiple sales channels , can boost the sales . __eou__ Well , we'll consider your proposal . __eou__
OK , I just want to brief you all on the travel market in Taiwan . To start with , generally speaking , the travel industry in Taiwan focuses mainly on tours . This segment of the industry is well developed . __eou__ Sorry to interrupt , Doris , but can you tell me more about these tour groups , what kind of things they enjoy , and so on ? __eou__ Yes , of course . Most of the time , when they travel , they prefer to do so in large groups accompanied by a guide , who usually takes care of everything , for instance , choosing the restaurants , the itinerary , the mode of transport , and things like that . Another thing is that most travelers to the UK tend to be middle aged , around 40 to 50 or so . This age group is less adventurous ; they like good hotels , and have money to spend . They kind of prefer to stay in the cities where they feel safer . They are not into mountain climbing in Wales or anything . __eou__ I don ’ t mean to interrupt , but can you tell me what plans you have for growing the youth market ? __eou__ Just a moment . I'll tell you about that in a minute . Where was I ? Oh yes . By way of illustration , let ’ s look at the top five destinations in the UK for this kind of traveler over the last five years . If you look at page ten you can see what I mean . In spite of these characteristics of the market , I still think there is room for growth in the youth sector . __eou__ So how do you intend to do that ? __eou__ OK , let me tell you what we ’ Ve been doing . We ’ Ve been in touch with the Wales and Scottish Tourist development offices here in Taiwan and they ’ re interested in working with us to promote their regions to the youth segment . We ’ Ve decided to implement an advertising campaign focusing on the excitement of the activities in those regions . __eou__ May I interrupt you for a moment ? __eou__ Go ahead . __eou__ How much is it going to cost , and who is going to pay ? __eou__ Well , at the moment we are trying to work out those details . We haven't managed to come up with a concrete plan yet , but we are working on it . __eou__ I see . OK . So what ’ s next ? __eou__ Well , our intention is to have some features about these regions in some youth magazines . We ’ re also going to run some ads on TV and put some flyers in places where young people go , like the gym and student organizations . We ’ re making arrangements to have some activities at big shopping malls and department stores around town . __eou__
Hi , Xavier . I'd like to go over the list of jobs for next week's maintenance shut . __eou__ Sure . We've got a lot to do in a short time . We're planning to shut the line at midday on Wednesday and start up again at 6 pm the following day . We might need to extend the shut by about six hours . __eou__ Our production people won't be happy about that . We've got a full order book at the moment . Is there any way you could speed things up ? __eou__ Not really . We need to dismantle the conveyor belt and replace the rollers . __eou__
John hasn't turned up and Stefan is ill . Do we have anyone on stand-by ? __eou__ I'm afraid not , we're very short-staffed at the moment . Can you ask the shift supervisor to ask one of his team to do some overtime ? Perhaps Tommy can stand in for an hour or two until we find a replacement . __eou__
That's the warehouse where the large items of office equipment are stored . __eou__ If I ordered a desk today , how would it be before I got delivery in Scotland ? __eou__ Well , I think perhaps you'd better speak to our Production Manager , Mr . Yao . You'll meet him when we go over to the factory . __eou__
Benter's Books . __eou__ Yes , I need to order a large number of Webster's dictionaries . __eou__ We have several hundred in stock . __eou__ Is there a discount for buying in large quantity ? __eou__
Where are you going to play this weekend ? __eou__ I have not given it much thought . Do you have any good suggestions ? __eou__ I want to spend two days in the mountains with friends . The city is too noisy . Do you know Tangle Temple ? __eou__ I have been there . It is in the middle of the mountains . It is not noisy there and you have to be a vegetarian . __eou__ Do you want to climb the mountain with us ? __eou__ Does it have enough lodging ? __eou__ No problem . The temple is quite large . __eou__ There are many ancient pine trees there . It is especially quiet at night . It is wonderful to listen to the monks chanting while listening to the soothing sound of the winds in the pine trees . __eou__ I'm getting a little excited now . What clothes should I wear ? __eou__ Take some thick clothes with you . It is rather cold there at night . If you wear the T-shirt you're wearing now , you will become a ' popsicle ' . __eou__ Anything else I should bring ? __eou__ If you like taking pictures , you may bring a camera with you . __eou__ Needless to say . __eou__
Daniel , here is some money for the tickets . __eou__ OK , it's my pleasure . How many tickets ? __eou__ Oh , like a gentleman . Two tickets for two people . __eou__ But I am only half a person as you and they charge both of us the same price tickets . __eou__ They may unless we get a half-price ticket for you . __eou__ Dad , it makes no sense . __eou__ You may ask if you can take a half-price ticket . __eou__ Yeah , I make certain . A half-price ticket cuts us one point five Yuan . __eou__
An idea about killing time on a train ? __eou__ I advise you to read Playboy.You can get a lot from it . __eou__ But there's quite a lot of rumors about it . __eou__ That's why it's interesting . __eou__
This is our first day of class.It ' s better for us to introduce ourselves to each other . Who would like to begin first ? Any volunteers ? __eou__ I'd like to introduce myself first . __eou__ Yes , please . __eou__ My name is Gavin White . I was born and raised in London . After high school , I went to Edinburgh University . I worked for one year to pay for my tuition and then got my Bachelor ’ s degree there . Now I've come here to get my Master ’ s degree . I am glad to meet all of you and I hope we will become good friends . __eou__
Congratulations on your success in the competition . That is quite something . __eou__ Thank you . I was lucky this time . __eou__ I think luck played a very small part in your victory . It is solely due to your hard work and efforts . That brings honor to you and joy to us . __eou__ I am flattered . __eou__ It is real word . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__
Can you believe that Susan got married ? __eou__ Really ? I remember she said if she would remain single . Is the man very rich ? __eou__ No . That ’ s what is surprising me . __eou__ You means she didn ’ t marry a rich man . __eou__ He ’ s a postman . __eou__ I thought she would marry a fortune . __eou__

And there also might be some legal consequences . __eou__ Why would the person who told have problems with the law ? __eou__ Because whoever let the cat out of the bag was breaking client confidentiality . __eou__ I didn't think about that . That's pretty serious . Are there investigators working on finding out who it was ? __eou__ I'm sure management is on top of it . __eou__
Mary , do you remember when we met ? __eou__ I won't ever forget it ! I was sitting in the cafeteria all by myself ... __eou__ And I came up and asked to sit by you ... __eou__ Oh , it seems like it was just yesterday . __eou__

Jack , what do you think about the election ? __eou__ I think the campaign is a blockbuster . __eou__ How many people have flung their hats into the ring ? __eou__ Finally 100 candidates ran for one seat . __eou__ Who do you think will be elected ? __eou__ It's hard to say . They all had an active campaign to round up the votes . __eou__ I think Mr .

Hey , Mike . You've been surfing the Net for quite a while . What on earth are you searching for ? __eou__ It's something relative hackers . I often hear people talking about them , but I don't know much about them . __eou__ Well , roughly speaking , a hacker is a computer buff . __eou__ You mean a guy using enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the computer ? __eou__ You can say that . __eou__ But why are people always having such a negative attitude towards them ? __eou__ They must have mixed hackers with crackers . __eou__ What is crackers then ? __eou__ There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers , but they aren't . They break into computers and break the phone system . Real hackers call these people crackers , and want nothing to do with them . __eou__ So they are two totally different concepts . __eou__ Well , the real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy , irresponsible and not very bright , and feel that being able to break security does make you a hacker any more than being able to start cars without keys makes you an automotive engineer . Unfortunately , many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word hacker to describe crackers . This irritates real hackers to no end . __eou__ I see . Then the basic different is , hackers build things , crackers break them . __eou__ You got it . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__ You are welcome . __eou__

I think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much . __eou__ I have the same idea as yours . __eou__ It's OK . Please have a taste of it . __eou__ Thank you . Oh , it's very delicious . __eou__ Thank you for your praise . __eou__ Besides steamed fish , what else are you good at cooking ? __eou__ I am good at stewing beef with potato , frying chicken , hot and sour soup etc . __eou__ So many dishes .

Don't tell Jenny the truth , only tell her the white lie . When she grows up , you find the suitable opportunity to tell her . __eou__ I see . OK . __eou__

Not anymore.Mine is highly educated but traditional family . Most South Korea families today are a lot smaller . In traditional families , the old people are well respected and taken good care of . Ho __eou__ My family setup is a bit different . In New York city , there're only three people , my mother , my stepfather and me . During this summertime , I fly out to California and live with my dad . Dad's getting __eou__ Of course there'll be a room for you ! __eou__ To be blunt , maybe I won't be able to get along with his new wife or her kids . __eou__ Yours is a modern family . I'm sure your dad loves you and would want you to stay for the summer . You just need to try your best to get along with your new stepmother and her boys . __eou__ But four boys ! __eou__ It will be a new experience , and you might as well learn to adjust to changes . __eou__ You are right , I guess.The world keeps changing , and so do families . But I like a small-sized or medium-sized family where everybody is equal to everybody else . That's what I want . __eou__ It is good to have goals in life . If California doesn't work out , come and visit me in Korea , OK ? __eou__ That's a great idea ! __eou__ We could share a room ! It would be fun . And we could do some traveling around Korea . You could see for yourself what life in a big family is like ! __eou__ That sounds like an excellent offer . I might take you up on that . Thank you for the wonderful invitation . __eou__

I am assigned to work in the assembly shop . __eou__ How long will you work a day ? __eou__ My working hours aren ’ t fixed , sometimes I do the day shift , sometimes the night shift . In all , about 8 hours . __eou__ That ’ s rather hard . __eou__ But it matches my major . __eou__ How will you get your pay ? __eou__ My wage depends on production results . __eou__ What sort of welfare facilities does your company provide ? __eou__ The company provides labor insurance for all employees , as well as fine retirement policy . __eou__ Is there a union ? __eou__ There is the company union , but it really shares the same aims as the management . __eou__ So you must consider dearly before you go to work . __eou__ I will . __eou__

Do you mind telling me the time when the recruitment will officially start ? __eou__ It will be held on October 15th . __eou__ Should I arrive early or on time ? __eou__ You'd better be early in case that you may be late because of traffic jam .

Morning , Tom ! What are you doing over there ? Learning to dance ? __eou__ Can't you see ? I'm practicing tai chi ! __eou__ Oh , my goodness . I'm sorry . But I don't think tai chi is to be practiced like that . __eou__ I'm just a beginner . Did my poses make me the butt of jokes ? __eou__ Well , they just look a bit funny . but far from making a laughing stock out of you . __eou__ So , is there anything wrong with my strokes ? __eou__ To begin with , you should keep your neck erect upward at any time . __eou__ Like this ? __eou__ Good ! And then , the entire body . Never incline your body forward or backward . Take care to regulate the point of balance . Place it at your waist . __eou__ Did I do it right ? __eou__ No ! You should avoid sticking out your belly . Keep your hip steady . Don't swing . __eou__ What should I do with my legs then ? __eou__ Oh , yes , things are quite different with the limbs . Keep your knees bent a little . Right , they should be rich in elasticity . Move slowly when you shift your centre of gravity from one leg to another . __eou__ Fantastic ! I guess the same is true with the arms , right ? __eou__ Exactly ! Move your arms in a relaxed manner . Well . don't stretch yourfingers stiffly . Just keep them in a natural shape . __eou__
What's in the box ? __eou__ Sandy , I think we made a mistake ... __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ It's a cute little teddy bear ! __eou__ How sweet ! Maybe he was just a shy guy who had a crush on you ! __eou__ And look what we did to him ! Hey ... he left me his business card . __eou__ Wow ! Call him tonight ! You guys will really have an interesting love story to tell everyone ! __eou__
Could you introduce some whitening products for me ? __eou__ Please forgive me just being frankly , madam . You don't need whitening products because you look pretty white .

This brand has a face cream which is effective on fading freckles . __eou__ How much is it ? __eou__ 419 yuan . __eou__ It is too expensive for me . Do you have something cheaper ? __eou__ I'm afraid there isn't . __eou__
Mom , can we get cable TV or a satellite dish ? __eou__ It costs money , dear . What ’ s wrong with the regular television stations ? __eou__ The shows are dull and they ’ re too many advertisements . __eou__ Well , you already watch too much TV instead of doing your homework , anyway . __eou__ There ’ re educational stations too . I could learn while I watched TV . __eou__ Well , that ’ s true , but you ’ d probably only watch cartoons and action movies . __eou__ No I wouldn ’ t ... can ’ t we get cable ? Everybody has cable . __eou__ Well , if everybody jumped off a bridge , would you jump too ? __eou__ Mom ! ! ! Please . All my friends have had it for years . __eou__ Get new friends . __eou__ Why are you always so mean ? __eou__ Because you ’ d end up spoiled rotten if I wasn ’ t . __eou__ I could help pay for it . __eou__ Let ’ s see how your grades are this semester , and maybe I ’ ll talk to your father about it . __eou__ O . K . Thanks , Mom ! __eou__
do you like cooking , Julia ? __eou__ I really enjoy it , especially when it ends up tasting good ! __eou__ how often do you usually cook ? __eou__ I usually make a few salads for lunch throughout the week and I make dinner about 6 times a week . __eou__ that's a lot of cooking . You must save a lot of money by eating at home so much . __eou__ I do . If you cook at home , you can eat healthy food cheaply . __eou__ what kind of dishes do you usually make ? __eou__ I almost always make either a beef roast or a chicken roast with asparagus , parsnips , peas , carrots and potatoes on Sundays . __eou__ do you make a lot of traditional British food ? __eou__ aside from the Sunday roast , we usually eat dangers and mash , toad-in-the-hole , or fish'n chips once a week . __eou__ how about spicy food ? __eou__ my family loves spicy food . We often eat Chinese , Thai , Indian , or Mexican food when we're in the mood for spice . __eou__ what's your favorite dish to make ? __eou__ I absolutely love making mousaka , which is a Greek dish with eggplant . But it takes a lot of time , so I don ’ t often make it . __eou__
What sport do you like the most ? __eou__ I like baseball the best . __eou__ Me too . Did you play when you were a kid ? __eou__ Yeah . I played until I graduated from high school . __eou__ What position did you play ? __eou__ I think I tried every position , but the last few years , I played third base . __eou__ I hate third base . It's scary when the ball is coming at you so fast . __eou__ It was scary at first , but after awhile , I got used to it . If you have fast reflexes , then it's not really a problem . What position did you play ? __eou__ I played outfield . I hated the infield because I never figured out all the bounces . __eou__ I wish I could play again , but there isn't much opportunities around here . __eou__ I'm on a softball league . It's not fast pitch , but it's still fun . You wanna join our group ? __eou__ When do you guys play ? __eou__ We play either Tuesdays or Thursdays . __eou__ Sounds pretty fun . I'll come out and join you next time . __eou__
It seems that you get antsy when you hear I praise another guy . __eou__ I get antsy not because you praise a guy , but because you may be taken for a ride by a guy like him . __eou__ How come you think of him that way ? __eou__ Because you seem to have lost your vigilance . You should be on the watch out . __eou__ I have no reason to distrust him . He's never caused any harm . __eou__ Isn't there anything that sounds fishy ? __eou__ Nothing smells a rat . I told you that he's an all-right guy . __eou__ All-right guy ? All right . Let's talk about something else instead . __eou__
Hi Amy , you look very happy . __eou__ Yes , I'm very pleased . I've just got two tickets to see the Olympic opening ceremony . __eou__ Wow . You must be very excited . __eou__ I certainly am .

I feel very thirsty as well . __eou__ Let ’ s go then . __eou__
My wife and I didn't used to spend this much money . __eou__ What's changed ? __eou__ My wife has been pregnant for 7 months . __eou__ I see .

I'll tell you something that's good about action movies . The special effects are great ! __eou__ But they are so silly ! They're not art ! __eou__ That's just your personal prejudice .

As for our financial situation , you can inquire about them in the national bank . They handle all our financial documents . __eou__ Thank you . And how is your business in the clothing business circle ? __eou__ A very good question .

You name it we deal with it . __eou__ That's nice . They provided us with convenient choice . __eou__ As for the regular customers , we have some favorable terms for them . __eou__ I'd like to hear that . __eou__ For the substantial regular customers , we offer 5 % commissions . __eou__ That sounds attractive , all right , how about that we sign a one year contract ? __eou__ Fabulous .

Print shop . Seam speaking . __eou__ Hi , Sean . It ’ s Mary in Mr . Emory ’ s office .

Would you like to have a piece of cake ? __eou__ No , thank you . I'm on a diet . __eou__ Why ? You're not fat . __eou__ I'm considering entering for the beauty contest this summer , so I must have a slender figure . __eou__ Women of all shapes would be beautiful if they are self-confident . __eou__ I'm afraid the judges do not think so . All the beauty contests are for slim girls only . __eou__ Well . There's a beauty contest in Thailand just for fat beauties . __eou__ How much do they weigh ? __eou__ All the beauties who entered the contest were over 80kg . __eou__ But I'm not fat enough to enter that contest . __eou__

And we'll go to Five-lake Strict and the Wall Street . __eou__ So , you're going to have a really nice vacation . __eou__ You can say that again . __eou__
Have you read all these crazy things that are going on around the world ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed ! Then they are sold on the black market . __eou__ Don't tell me you actually believe all that ? Don't be so gullible , they are just urban legends . They are just stories people make up to scare you . __eou__ Well , I was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you play them backwards ! Can you believe that ? __eou__ You really think an artist or song writer is going to go through the trouble of putting subliminal or satanic messages in a song ? Don't be so naive ! __eou__ Well maybe you are right , but how about the story of how KFC has rows of headless chickens which are super grown in order to get bigger chickens faster ! __eou__ Sounds a bit too far fetched to be true , don't you think ? __eou__
It's your turn to go first . __eou__ I went first last time . __eou__ No , Mary went first last time . __eou__ Oh , Okay . __eou__
Jenny , you're too lazy . You should do some exercise . See , you're getting fat . __eou__ Dad , it's raining outside . __eou__ That is your excuse . __eou__ All right , all right , I will go swimming with Peter this afternoon . __eou__ Not just today . Go exercise everyday ! __eou__
May I have a cookie ? __eou__ Help yourself . __eou__
Mom , I'm ready for school . __eou__ Don't forger to come straight home after school . __eou__ I know , mom . __eou__ Have you got everything ? __eou__ Oh , my jump rope . Mom , can you get it for me ? __eou__
There are many new kinds of newspapers . I find it hard to choose among them . Which is the most popular paper circulating in our city ? __eou__ I'd recommend you the Morning Paper , it is true that the paper is a newly issued one , but its circulation is rising . Last month , it reached to three hundred thousand , which is a very good figure for a new paper . __eou__ What's the reason that people prefer to read this one ? __eou__ I think perhaps the news stories in it are truthful and accurate . It also has a special page about the stock market ; maybe this is the real reason for its popularity . Many people are now speculating in the stock market . __eou__ I can predict it will have the largest circulation in one or two years . __eou__
I think Yoga might be suitable for me . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because it doesn't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up . __eou__ But I see people sweat a lot doing Yoga too . __eou__ I don't know . I just need to try it once . I'm in urgent need of some exercise to lose some weight . __eou__ You should try swimming then . It helps you to keep fit . __eou__
What's the fare , please ? __eou__ Twenty dollars and sixty cents . __eou__ What ? You're overcharging me ! __eou__ No way . Look . That's what the meter says . __eou__ Then something must be wrong with the meter . __eou__
How about we go to the flea market today ? __eou__ Great . I have long been looking forward to there . __eou__ Me , too . There are so many cheap but nice things . __eou__ I can't help shopping there . __eou__

I can't find proper parking space . __eou__ Let's just park here . __eou__ No , there's no parking sign . __eou__ Oh , the policeman's coming . __eou__
How big is this parking lot in our community ? __eou__ It has fifty parking spaces . __eou__ So you guys should be always busy . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ I bet it is always full of cars . __eou__ Quite the contrary , sir . Plenty of the spaces here are free when people drive their cars out to work . __eou__ Ah ... I see . __eou__ We plan to rent some of them out at the hourly rates . __eou__ What is the hourly rate for a car like this ? __eou__ I am not sure . But it'll be at least ten yuan an hour . __eou__ How mush would it cost if someone parks here for one hour and ten minutes ? __eou__ That would be twenty yuan , sir . We charge only by the number of hours , no split of each hour . __eou__ That's expensive . __eou__
Can you fix me a cup of tea , Johnny ? __eou__ Well ... uh ... how about a glass of juice instead ? __eou__ No . I'd like tea . Can you put it in my favorite cup ? You probably washed it ... __eou__ Oh , yeah . Well , uh , about your mug ... __eou__ I'll find it ... Where are all the floral pattern plates ? And dad's Yankee's mug ? __eou__

The principal just announced that Dr . Smith is going to take over as dean of our department . __eou__ Oh . __eou__ Why are you so calm ? Are you not surprised to hear this ? __eou__ No , I knew it all along . He was the obvious choice . __eou__ Do you think he can do well ? __eou__ A new broom sweeps clean anyway . __eou__
The answer is zero ! What a let-down ! __eou__ I really want to take him over my knee . __eou__ No hard feelings . After all , he is a child . __eou__ If you say so ! __eou__
Harry was angry last night . __eou__ That's because he's getting nervous . Anyway , this is the first time he's directed a play . __eou__ But he used to be very relaxed and cheerful . It's not like Harry to do a thing like that . __eou__ Yes , you're right . Maybe there's any other reason . __eou__
I have a complaint to make . The bill you sent me was incorrect . What's more , it isn't the first time __eou__ Well , I must apologize , madam . We have new computers here , you know . __eou__ Don't you think it's about time you got them working properly ? __eou__ I agree entirely . I assure you it won't happen again . __eou__
Have you followed the value of dollar lately ? __eou__ How could I help but follow it ? The fluctuation of dollar is killing my company ! The exchange rates are eating into our profits , and we can't do anything about it . __eou__ It's really frustrating , isn't it ? I have the same problem . I would feel a lot better if the currency was a little more stable . With the way the dollar plummeting lately , my securities have gone up in smoke . __eou__ Every day I have less money ! I haven't spent anything , it is just melting away because of the shifts in exchange rate . __eou__ What we really should be making investment in is the Euro . I've followed the Euro's progress over the last quarter , I think it's about time to buy in . __eou__ What about the Yen ? __eou__ Are you kidding ? The Yen is in worse shape than the Dollar ! __eou__
I'm so glad I bought this watch ! __eou__ Cool ! Flashy red lines ! __eou__ I think this is the coolest watch I've ever owned . __eou__ Is it waterproof ? __eou__ Isn't that a silly question ? You know how much of an athlete I am . __eou__ Uh , huh ... so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for ? __eou__ Well , surfing , scuba diving ... __eou__
I'll never ever work together with him ! __eou__ What happened ? Quarrel again ? __eou__ Will you take my materials back from him for me ? Please ! __eou__ Don't ask me . I don't wanna be involved in your quarrel . __eou__
I went bungee jumping yesterday . __eou__ That sounds like fun . __eou__
Rachel , do you like music ? __eou__ Of course . I can't live without it , so I always bring my CD with me no matter where I go . __eou__ What kind of music do you like best ? __eou__ Light music and classic music . __eou__ Really ? I can't believe this . I am also keen on classic music . And do you know there is a concert of classic music tomorrow evening ? __eou__ But I didn't get the ticket . And it is said that they were sold out yesterday . __eou__ I got two . We can go there together . __eou__ Amazing ! I can imagine the feeling when I hear the smooth tune around my ears . __eou__
Thanks for helping me move into my new house . __eou__ Any time . I'm just glad I could help . __eou__
Happy Thanksgiving ! __eou__ You , too . __eou__ Let's have pumpkin pie . __eou__ It's my favorite . __eou__
It's time to leave the office for the night . Firstly I log off my computer , then I set the electronic security system . __eou__ That's pretty advanced . __eou__ Now I'll quickly send a short message to my wife and take the elevator down to the basement . __eou__ Is that where you park ? __eou__ Yes , the car park is under constant video surveillance , so my car is quite safe . Please get in . __eou__ Thank you . Where is your key ? __eou__ There's no need , I have keyless entry , and the steering wheel recognizes my finger prints before starting the car . Now , we can look at the navigation system to find the best route home . __eou__ That's amazing , it even shows all the roads that are congested at the moment . __eou__ Using GPS I can rely on this to direct me home . Now I just need to find my E-Card to automatically open the gate and we can drive out . __eou__ Pretty soon cars will be driving themselves . __eou__ Maybe , but in the meantime why not help me find the remote control for my garage door ? __eou__ Here it is , and here we are . __eou__ When I turn off my home alarm , the house will automatically tum on the lights and set the climate to a comfortable level . __eou__ I have to get home , but I don't need all of this fancy technology , I think I'll just walk . __eou__
I have talked a lot about your restaurant business and your friends with my friends . One of my friends seems to be on good terms with Sue . __eou__ Is he beating Mark ’ s time ? __eou__ She is indeed well . But she would not give anyone a tumble , you bet . __eou__
I told you that she is no fool . __eou__ I know she is quite an article , but I was not sure of her ability to cope with a boss . __eou__ She cannot get in Dutch with him . He is her boss , you know . __eou__ But most bosses are fools for woman . __eou__
Ben always appears rude to the people around him . __eou__ But he's really kind at heart . __eou__ That's true . We can not judge people by appearance . __eou__
I cannot stay here any more minutes . __eou__ What is wrong with you ? __eou__ Tom is making so much noise . I have not a bit of peace and quiet all evening . __eou__ You can talk with him . __eou__
Have you met John recently ? __eou__ I saw him last week . It seems he was a bit queer in the head . __eou__ Yes , he has been like that since his accident . __eou__ What a pity ! __eou__
I heard Tom was caught stealing something again in the supermarket . __eou__ Really ? He deserves it ! They should teach him a good lesson . __eou__ But the word is his brother would go bail for him . Last time it ’ s his father who went bail for him . __eou__ Then he is really lucky . __eou__
Suit wrote me a letter . __eou__ What did she say ? __eou__ She got a master degree , and now she is going for her doctor . __eou__ Really ? I can't believe it . __eou__ It's not a surprise , is it ? She has always been a hard working student . __eou__ But I think a master degree is good enough for a girl . __eou__
What do you mean ? If he was a good programmer , he should have been raking it in . __eou__ The boss wanted to pay Bob with stock options . But Bob didn't want to play that game again . __eou__ Again ? __eou__ At his last start-up , Bob worked for stock and no salary . They folded and he made zip . __eou__ Ouch . __eou__ Now he only works freelance . Hundred bucks an hour . __eou__
Your tree looks beautiful . Do you decorate it this way every year ? __eou__ Yes , it's a family tradition dating back to my childhood . We use the same lights and ornaments , but of course we have a new tree each year.The children made some of these decorations . Here , you can hang this on one of those high branches . __eou__ Well , everything seems to be just about ready . Now all we need is snow.Do you exchange the presents in the morning ? __eou__ Oh , yes . The kids are too excited to wait . After we clean up the mess all the empty boxes and the wrapping paper we have a big breakfast . Then the kids have the whole day to play with their new toys . __eou__ And we'll have a great turkey dinner at around four o'clock . My brother and his family will be joining us . I look forward to meeting them . Well , it's late , so I'll say good night . I'll see you early tomorrow , so I can share your Christmas morning.Good night ! __eou__

I'll whisper it to you , but you have to promise not to tell anyone ! __eou__ What ? ! You did that ? ? ! ! ! __eou__
Have you seen Harry ? __eou__ No . As far as I can remember he was supposed to be on a business trip to Lisbon . __eou__ Yes , but he was supposed to be back by now . __eou__ Maybe you'll call his home . __eou__
If the weatherman's predictions are accurate , it should rain tomorrow . __eou__ I hope not . Then we'd have to reschedule our baseball game . __eou__

Good morning , sir , can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I was wondering if you had the time to show me around this exhibition ? __eou__ I'd be glad to , sir . But may I ask what line of business you are in ? __eou__ I'm in the electrical appliances . __eou__ I see . Would you be interested in seeing the audio-visual products ? They are made by our company . __eou__ Thanks , they are rather attractive . But I think there is nothing better than seeing things In actual operation . __eou__ Yes , of course . Would you like to make an inspection tour of some factories ? __eou__ Yes , very much , if it wouldn't add inconvenience to you . First hand information is always more valuable than reading pamphlets . __eou__ I'll make the arrangement and let you know the time tomorrow . __eou__ That would be great . __eou__
How can I be sure your products are of superior quality , as you promised ? __eou__ One of the reasons for our good quality products is because of our quality inspection system , which is the best of its kind . __eou__ But a quality inspection system does not mean that each unit will always be up to the standard . __eou__ We have trained analyzers to do quality analysis at the end of each part when we make the product . This means that no mistakes are made . __eou__ Your salesman also told me that each worker is trained to do quality analysis . Can you tell me a little about that ? __eou__ Certainly . We provide quality analysis training as part of the training for all new workers , plus a week of further training every year . __eou__
What is the great trait in your personality ? __eou__ I suppose my strong point is that I like developing new things and ideas . __eou__ So you may like inventive jobs . __eou__ Yes , I like inventive jobs and I am capable and responsible . __eou__

You can go take a look . __eou__
How do you think a manager should react to an employee ’ s unsatisfactory work ? __eou__ If I were a manager , I would have a private talk with this employ to figure out the reasons . It is very important to have this one-to-one discussion in an unthreatening situation without any distraction . __eou__ Exactly , I overheard a manager scold his employee in the elevator this morning , they were from the company on the 12th floor , I guess . They were only three of us in the elevator , I felt very embarrassed to be in the middle of them . __eou__ Well , I guess the employee would feel more embarrassed and probably angry . Anyway , it is not wise at all to give a harsh time to your employee in front of others , especially strangers . __eou__ Sure , no matter what happened , they should wait to discuss in their office and find the solution in a positive way . __eou__
This is what my boss is expecting , Sandy . He wants a detailed list of expenses and equipment costs . __eou__ That ’ s going to take a while to put together , Paul . __eou__ The sooner , the better , Sandy .

They do not hurt car as much . __eou__ Oh , why such a high mileage ? __eou__ The owner was commuting everyday crossing the state line . __eou__ Okay . Does this car have a warranty ? __eou__ One month . __eou__ How do I make sure I am not buying a junk ? __eou__ You'll check it out anyway you want . You can take it to a garage . __eou__ How much is it ? __eou__ $ 5,900 . __eou__ I'll have to think about it . __eou__ Leave your phone number , and I will give you a call if the price gets reduced . __eou__ Okay . __eou__

I ’ Ve begun organizing everything for the funeral . __eou__ How ’ s that going ? __eou__ It ’ s a lot harder than I imagined . There are many things that you have to to arrange . I booked a time and date with the funeral home , but I still have a lot of things to do . __eou__ Have you bought a burial plot and a casket ? __eou__ No . Wendy is being cremated . She always talked about how she didn ’ t want to be buried . I already chose a cremation urn and we plan to spread the ashes in the ocean . __eou__ I see , that sounds like something she would have really liked . I am sure the memorial service will be tasteful . You are doing a great job . __eou__ Thanks , it hasn ’ t been easy , but luckily we have life insurance and Wendy left behind a detailed will that will sort out any other legal matters . __eou__
This is a nice set of wheels . How much did the dealer charge you for this ? __eou__ A lot . I probably got to moonlight for the rest of my life , but so what , it ’ s worth it . Come on , get in . Let ’ s take a drive . __eou__ Okay then , let ’ s go fast ! Whoa ! This thing can really accelerate fast . __eou__ Check out what happens when I put on the brakes suddenly . It can stop quickly . __eou__ Hey , just watch out for cops or you ’ re gonna end up in the slammer . You know you tend to go fast ? __eou__ Yes , I know it . I went through my last set of tires fast . I even had three flat tires in two weeks . __eou__ Now watch ... some guys probably run a light and hit your car . __eou__ Cut out , would you ? __eou__
I tried to ask the bank teller why it changed , but she didn't speak English well enough.So I decided to go to the magazine shop . The one around the corner.And I bought an American newspaper . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ It seems that yesterday the Mexican government declared wouldn't pay back the loans it got from the World Bank.The government declared a default on the loans . __eou__ That's serious . __eou__ I know . The economy here is having serious problems.But because the government declared a default , the currency value went way down . __eou__ So now Mexican pesos are worth about half as much . __eou__ Yes , it's an amazing drop . __eou__ Wow . I feel sorry for the Mexicans . But it's good for us . __eou__ Yes , it's very good . We suddenly have twice as much money to spend here.Our hotel is now half as expensive as when we got here ! Isn't that strange ? __eou__ Yes , and you know what ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ I don't really like this hotel that much.So tonight , now that we are so rich , tonight why don't we stay in the most expensive hotel in town ? __eou__ Why not ? We should do it . Because now we can afford it . __eou__
Hey , Daniel , how's it going ? __eou__ Hey , Daddy , today I had really a fantastic history class . __eou__ Wow , it's so strange for you to say things like that . What had happened ? __eou__ We've learnt the story of Zheg He Sailing to West Ocean . He is a real great navigator . __eou__ Did your teacher tell you the route he took ? __eou__ Yeah , he , with his fleet , came across the Indian Ocean , and arrived at the east coast of Africa . __eou__ Great , do you still remember when he started his voyage ? __eou__ Of course , that is from 1405 to 1433 , which is in Ming dynasty . __eou__ Good , by the way , do you finish reading the book Robinson Crusoe I've bought for you ? __eou__ Not yet , you know I have a lot of homework to do . __eou__ You should speed up , because the story of Robinson can give you a better understanding about what you learned today . __eou__ OK , great Daddy , after supper , I'll embark on it . __eou__ That's my boy ! Wait , Daniel , when is Pirates of the Caribbean on ? __eou__ Is it about Captain Jack Sparrow , who wants to find the treasure on the sea ? __eou__ Exactly , now , tell me the time . __eou__ I won't tell you , unless you promise to let me watch it with you . __eou__

We are merging with Trusten ? I never thought that would happen.Will we be getting new owners ? Will it affect our jobs ? __eou__ Probably.The new owners will be coming to start alignment meetings nextweek.One of the big question is what to call the new conglomerate company . __eou__ Wow , with such a big change.We won't have the same name ? __eou__ It's not only the name of our company that will change ... I expect that after this acquisition , there'll be a ton of things up in the air . __eou__
Sir , I've finished your shaving . Wow , it takes years off you after having a shave . __eou__ Really ? You've done a good job . __eou__ Thank you .

Several men have tried it in my A shop . Do you want to try ? __eou__ Yeah , let me have a try . __eou__

It's my first visit to Prague , I'll be here for three days for a conference , then I have a day on my own to do some sightseeing before I head back home . What do you suggest I see when I'm here ? __eou__ There are many interesting places you should be sure to see . One problem is transportation , however . Because the city is very old , the roads are narrow and congested . If you only have three or four days to visit , you don't want to spend them waiting in traffic in a cab . I suggest you take the subway . __eou__ The subway ? But is there a subway station next to my hotel ? I have to go between the conference center and the hotel several times a day ... __eou__ No worries , there's a subway station at the conference center itself , and a shuttle from your hotel to the conference center that takes only 5 minutes . When you do your personal sightseeing , you can first take the shuttle to the conference center , then hop on the metro . __eou__ Is it expensive to ride on the underground ? __eou__ You can get a daily pass that will allow you to travel unlimited for the whole day for about 6 dollars . Otherwise , you can pay by trip , which is about 50 cents to 2 dollars each trip , depending on how far you go . __eou__ Is it easy to get lost ? __eou__ No , no ... . it's very hard to get lost . There are two lines , one that goes in a circle , the other that is straight . If you get lost , there are always subway attendants that can help you find your way . __eou__
David , what do you want to do after graduation ? __eou__ I suppose I should choose one from the ' Best Career List ' , to be a public officer , what do you think ? __eou__ That sounds like a hot job , right ? But in my opinion , you ought not to choose one career from that so-called list , and you need to take your interests , values , and skills into account . __eou__ It beats me ! I never thought about it before and maybe I thought finding a career is a simple thing . __eou__ You'd better ask for suggestions from a career counselor , and then make a decision . __eou__
Where are you going this weekend ? __eou__ I have no idea . Maybe I will sleep for the whole day . __eou__ So boring ! Shall we go out for a picnic with my friends ? __eou__ Sounds interesting .

The items you consume are put on your bill . __eou__ I had no idea – and look at these charges for movies ! __eou__ Those are for pay-per-view movies . Each time you selected a movie , the entertainment system prompted you to confirm that you really wanted it , right ? __eou__ Yes , that ’ s right . But I had no idea I would be charged for all this . Thank goodness my company will let me reimburse all this . __eou__

Her cheekbones are great . __eou__ She doesn't have an ounce of fat on her face . __eou__ The mag says she's 165 centimeters tall and 38 kilos .

Too much work . I hate to sweat . It's so gross . __eou__
Welcome back racing fans !

They are heading to turn three and Lewis Hamilton tries to pass Rikknen ! It ’ s a close one and , oh no ! Hamilton hits the wall ! __eou__ He came in too fast , jammed on the breaks and spun out . We have a yellow flag and the pace car is making its way onto the track . __eou__ The cleanup crew is towing the heavily damaged car and the green flag drops ! Rikknen is still in the lead with only two laps to go ! __eou__ Smoke is coming out of his car ! He seems to be having engine trouble ! He makes his way into the pit , and Fernando Alonso takes the lead ! __eou__ How unlucky for Rikknen , and this race is over ladies and gentlemen , Alonso takes the checkered flag ! __eou__
I don't know what to say . This can't be happening . Here's the obituary . __eou__ It's really there ? This all seems so surreal-like it's all one big nightmare . __eou__ But it explains why Taylor isn't answering and Femi took time off from work . __eou__ Poor Femi . Taylor's death must have made her realize that she still cared for him . __eou__ This says the viewing is at Myers Funeral Home today until five . __eou__ It's already half past four . We should go and pay our respects . Taylor's family will be there . __eou__

How did you get that idea ? __eou__ It ’ s just a simple decorating . I just want to add my personality to my living space . __eou__
May I ask you a few questions about insurance ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Now we've given a CIF Shanghai price for some steel plates . What insurance rate do you suggest we should get ? __eou__ Well . Obviously , you won ’ t want All Risks cover . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Because they aren ’ t delicate goods and won ’ t likely be damaged on the voyage . FPA will be good enough . __eou__ Then am I right in understanding that FPA doesn't cover partial loss for the nature of particular average . __eou__ That's right . On the other hand , a WA policy covers you against partial loss in all cases . __eou__ Are there any other clauses in marine policies ? __eou__ Oh , lots of them . For instance , War Risks , TEND and SICC . __eou__ Well , thank you very much for all that information . Could you give me a quotation for my consignment now ? __eou__ Are you going to make an offer today ? __eou__ Yes .

Have you got any experience in advertising ? __eou__ Yes , I have been working in the Public Relations Section of a company in the past two years . I plan the advertising campaign and cooperate the work of artists and typographers . Sometimes I have to do the work of a specialist when there ’ s something urgent . __eou__ Do you have any practical experience as a secretary ? __eou__ Yes , sir . I acted as a secretary in an insurance company . __eou__ Would you tell me the essential qualities a secretary should maintain ? __eou__ Well , to begin with , I would say she needs to be diligent , and the second point is that she has to do a lot of things on her own initiative . Finally , she can make notes in shorthand and types and has the skills in report writing , summary writing , keep minutes at meetings , and so on . Most important of all is that she seems to have a better memory than average . __eou__ Have you had any experience with computer ? __eou__ Yes , I studied in a computer training program , and can process data through the computer . __eou__ That's fine .

Let's keep eating ! __eou__ Can you turn the lazy Susan for me ? I want some more chicken . __eou__ All that's left is a leg . I gave the head to Tim ! __eou__
Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work . It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other . __eou__ If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company . __eou__ Beneficial ? I don ’ t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating . __eou__ But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency . __eou__ I doubt that . __eou__
Hello , this is IBA Bank . Maria speaking , how may I help ? __eou__ Hi , I'm looking into your loans and I'm a little confused about the interest rates . Could you give me some advice ? __eou__ Not a problem . Which loan was it you were interested in ? Sorry , I must ask , because the interest rates can depend on the type of loan you apply for . __eou__ I understand . I'm interested in the Petty Consumer Loan . __eou__ One of our most popular ! The usual interest rate is fixed by the PBC . That is The People's Bank of China . But of course , with some loans , credit rating and loan amount come into play , too . __eou__ So , the rate could fluctuate a little , depending on the amount given by the PBC ? __eou__ That is correct . __eou__ I'm going to have to do some more research into this . Thanks for your help , bye for now . __eou__
Good afternoon Miss , would you be interested in buying more life insurance ? You know , you can never get enough . __eou__ I think my husband has some . __eou__ Are you sure he ’ s purchased enough insurance for both of you ? If something terrible happened with your husband , and he doesn ’ t have sufficient insurance , my company does have a policy that could cover you and your husband if something happened to either of you . __eou__ That ’ s true . If something happened to my husband , I might lose everything . Both of us have to work to keep our home , car , and our children ’ s education . I can ’ t afford that by myself . __eou__ Could we sit and look at the policy I mentioned and see if that ’ s something suitable for you and your husband ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__
Have you ever tried shopping online ? __eou__ No , never . I prefer to actually see and touch what I'm buying before I pay for it , especially for clothes and shoes . __eou__ That's right . Seeing is believing . __eou__ I've heard some friends say when they get the article , it's quite different from what they see on the website advertisement . __eou__ That happens . Without close quality examination , we may encounter fraud , and the e-shop may suddenly disappear . __eou__ What's more , it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password . __eou__ It's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem . Paying online is much safer than before , but I still have the feeling that it's not safe enough . __eou__ I can't agree more . that's why I only do street shopping . __eou__ Me too . Sometimes I surf online shops to check some related information , and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping . __eou__ That's a good idea . __eou__
What are you reading about in that science magazine ? __eou__ There are several interesting articles on recent scientific breakthroughs . I just finished reading one about cloning . __eou__ I ’ m not sure I like the idea of that . I don ’ t want people copying me or other people . It could be very confusing . __eou__ According to the article , you have no real need to worry . Research nowadays is focussing on cloning parts of a human body to replace damaged or lost parts , not on recreating a whole human . __eou__ In the future , that could be possible . __eou__ In this article , scientists say that if you took the genes from someone and tried to create a copy of a person , there ’ s no guarantee that the copy would look or act like the original ! __eou__ Really ? What else have you discovered ? __eou__ I read about how scientists are using material from plants and animals to create new medicines . For example , an animal be immune to disease that affects human . So , scientists find out why it ’ s immune __eou__ That ’ s great , because it uses natural materials rather than ones that scientists make themselves . I prefer natural remedies to man-made ones . __eou__
Kim ! I'm here ! I brought all my old maternity clothes plus Dave and Alice's baby clothes ! __eou__ It's a little early for those , isn't it ? I still have eight months to go ... __eou__ Believe me , the time will fly by ! Before you know it , you'll be changing diapers ! You have to start preparing ! __eou__ I thought we could turn the upstairs study into a baby room . What do you think about lavender ? __eou__ I'll be back tomorrow with my work clothes and a gallon of lavender paint ! You just sit back and relax ! __eou__

It's true that you can take some for prevention . __eou__
Mrs . Phoebe , here are your ordered goods . Please inspect the goods now . __eou__ All right . Let me have a check . Can you tell me how can you inspect your exported goods ? __eou__ Our quality control department is in charge of the inspection , which is directly under general manager . It is essential to attach the importance to the quality of goods . It is the basement for the future cooperation . __eou__ That is good . And here I give you a piece of advice . You should have used stronger cardboard boxes for such a heavy item . Besides , it's better to secure the cartons with metal straps . What's more , the order number wasn't anywhere on some of the boxes . __eou__ I realize that now . I will do that after a while . __eou__ Thank you . Can I open the packages to check the color and style ? __eou__ Of course , let me help you . __eou__ The color and style are consistent with the sample . Great ! __eou__ You know , we are superior to other clothes companies . __eou__ Yes , that's for sure . There is nothing wrong with the quality . I think you'd better pack them first in plastic bags , than in cartons . __eou__ OK . We will manage it later . __eou__
What is your long term career plan you set for yourself ? __eou__ First of all , I hope to spend a few years working in some famous companies to command a skill , to set a solid foundation and to build my interpersonal network . When I feel I have accumulated enough experience , I hope to own an undertaking . Of course this is up to the situation then and the opportunities the companies offer me . In the long run , I hope to be an entrepreneur . __eou__
Could you please tell me how I can go job-hunting in the web ? __eou__ Generally speaking , job seekers can enter the websites either of job agencies or of some units for job advertisements . __eou__ How should I contact them ? __eou__ You can e-mail your application materials for application to the websites of job agencies for enrollment in their database . __eou__ Can I get a quick reply from the sites ? __eou__ Yes , usually it takes a short time , but you have to await the choice of the units for a while . __eou__
Hey , Ken ... I need to talk to you . __eou__ Sure ... what's up ? __eou__ Can we step into the conference room ? This is a more private conversation . __eou__ Sure ... __eou__ Ok ... I'm just going to lay it all out on the table , What do you think of Vincent's management style ? __eou__ Well , Vincent has only been CEO for a couple of years and ... well ... um ... __eou__ I don't want to put you on the spot . Here's what I'm getting at , I don't think Vincent is the man for the job . __eou__ Really ? And what led you to this conclusion ? __eou__ As I see it , he lacks the proper vision . His style is more about survival , and he's not taking the company anywhere.He ' s treading water instead of swimming . __eou__ Well , I confess I've had my doubts about his abilities before . It seems he mainly got the job because his famous aunt pulled some strings . __eou__ I've been with this firm for 26 years and I'd hate to see it go down the drain due to poor leadership skills . __eou__ Me too . But what can we do ? This isn't a reality TV show ... we can't just vote him out . __eou__ Yes and no ... We can't ask for a show of hands on who thinks he should be fired , but we can introduce a vote of no confidence at the next board meeting . __eou__ Interesting idea . You might be on to something . __eou__
Hello , Mr . Hammer . Jack Ross here . I'm calling to confirm our appointment on Monday at ten o'clock in your office . __eou__ Yes . Everything's all set . __eou__ I'd like to bring Mr .

But no one else , OK ? __eou__ Yes , Mr . Hammer . __eou__
do you like animals ? __eou__ yes , doesn't everyone ? __eou__ what's your favorite animal ? __eou__ it's hard to say . While dogs are more affectionate , cats are much easier to take care of . __eou__ have you ever had a dog ? __eou__ when I was little , we had a few domestic dogs at home . __eou__ they always say that dogs are a man's best friends . do you think that's true ? __eou__ definitely . rich or poor , dogs always love their masters . __eou__ how about cats ? Have you ever had one for a pet ? __eou__ i had one a few months ago , but she ended up running away . __eou__ how did that happen ? __eou__ she left through a window that was open one night and never returned . __eou__ you must have been devastated ! __eou__ i was pretty sad . i still hope that she'll return some day ! __eou__ I hope she does . Do you think you'll ever get another pet ? __eou__ I think I will . It's difficult to feel longly when you have a pet around . __eou__ i hope your cat finds its way back home . __eou__ i do , too . __eou__
It's weekend again , I'm glad I can arrange for my personal matters . __eou__ What do you mean by that ? __eou__ Oh , that means I can do whatever I like without few interruptions . __eou__ You've been always active and versatile . It seems that you are interested in everything . __eou__ Oh , really ? I just have lots of hobbies in my spare time ; such as going to the concert , painting , handwriting , reading novels and reading fashion magazines . What about yours ? __eou__ I have fewer hobbies than yours . That's why I find campus life a bit dull and uninteresting . __eou__ Oh , you can't think like that . We young people should try our best to learn new things and accept new ideas . You like taking photos and going to photography shows , why not practise the technique and catch something unforgeable ? __eou__ That's a good suggestion . It's fine today . Maybe I can take photos on the scenery of the lake at sunset . It must be fantastic . __eou__ I quite agree with you . With our hobbies , our life can be more colorful and exciting . __eou__ And I can concentrate on my study after the relaxation over the weekend . __eou__ Yes , it's a good habit to have a life-long hobby . Those who practise calligraphy and Qigong always live longer . __eou__
School has added several new courses to our grade this semester . I have more homework to do now . __eou__ What's your favorite course , Daniel ? __eou__ I like science most . __eou__ Science ? That's a surprise . __eou__ Surprise ? __eou__ I thought you would like PE . __eou__ I do like PE , but I am interested in science . __eou__ Are you interested in science ? I can't believe it . __eou__ Through this course , I can learn more about the world around us clearly . __eou__ Your parents would be happy if they knew that . Because you are always a naughty boy . __eou__ Naughty ? I'm naughty ? I'm just clever . So I only do the things I am interested in . __eou__ Hope so . __eou__
I could get along fine without all the office politics . __eou__ What's going on ? __eou__ There is a position I've had my eye on for several months now and I had good reason to believe that it was mine for the asking . __eou__ So what happened ? __eou__ We were awarded government funding last year and in order to keep it we have to hire so Ay new employees . __eou__ So what does that have to do with this position ? __eou__ Someone in the main office has a nephew who he thinks can slide right into the Management position I wanted . __eou__ All under the precept of keeping the funding ? That stinks . __eou__
What a nice dress , Jean.You look marvelous ! __eou__ You , too . Where did you get your new hat ? __eou__ From the Crown's . Oh , what lovely earrings you have ! Are they diamond ? __eou__ Yes . It's a birthday present from my husband ! __eou__ Well , you are lucky to have such a considerate husband . Mine hasn't brought me a single rose since we married . __eou__ He'll come out with surprises . Just wait and see . Look at that woman , with the white chiffon ! __eou__ She's chic , isn't she ? __eou__ Yes . I like the dress . It must be the latest fashion . Look , the hem has lowered , and the waist narrowed . __eou__ It makes me feel rather shabby . That woman has a good taste in dressing , I would say . __eou__ Yes . She dressed with an individual flair . I rather envy her . __eou__ Most women follow fashion like sheep.They don't know any better than imitate . __eou__ I quite agree with you.See the woman there ? I dare say she hasn't got any eyes . How could she match the mauve gown with the green handbag ? And all that jewelry ! __eou__ The gown is quite expensive , believe me . __eou__ So what ? It only makes her look cheap and vulgar . __eou__ You know those upstarts . They're all show-offs ! I think I'd better have a diet ; otherwise I'd look like a ballon soon . __eou__ You're quite slim . In fact , if you were one of those starlets , the movie company would say you have a fabulous figure . __eou__ Thanks . I'm flattered . __eou__ Oh , my shoes pinch me . Let's find a seat and sit a while . __eou__
I've got to put together a sales pitch to give to our clients in the morning . You always give such amazing presentations , I was hoping you could give me some advice about how to win them over tomorrow . __eou__ Sure , it's easy . First of all , the secret to a successful oral presentation is to keep things simple . People are listening and they usually don't have a long attention spans . Stick to about three or four points , give an overview of the points , then present them one by one , and then summarize at the end . Be straightforward and organized and you're sure to be remembered . __eou__ What kind of visuals should I use to support the presentation ? Do you think I should use PowerPoint ? __eou__ You should consider the size and interests of your audience . In other words , who is listening , and what do they want to hear ... you can put together a PPT with some graphics and animations that will catch people's attention , but be careful not to go overboard . __eou__ I think I can put something together , no problem . But when it comes to tomorrow , I'll just be a bundle of nerves ! How can I get over my fear of speaking in public ? __eou__ You know , stage fright is very normal , most people get nervous before they have to speak in front of large groups . Just prepare well , rehearse beforehand , and trust that you will be great ... and you will be ! __eou__
I'm glad we took the train . I don't like to ride in buses . __eou__ Yes , I agree . We can see the scenery better . In a bus , all you see are the roads . __eou__ Even in Taiwan , I always liked to take the train . It is more comfortable . __eou__ I agree . Buses bounce too much . After two or three hours , you feel too tired . __eou__ Look at that village ! __eou__ Beautiful . __eou__ Do you think I can take a picture through this window ? __eou__ I don't know if it will turn out good.The window might cause the picture to be blurry . __eou__
Good afternoon . Can I help you ? __eou__ I need some remedies for an upset stomach . __eou__ Are you also suffering from pain and fever ? __eou__ Yes , and I also have the runs __eou__ I'll give you some tablets that should make you feel better . One moment , please . Here you are . Take these tablets three times a day swallow them with water . __eou__ When should I take them ? __eou__ Take on after each meal . __eou__ How long should I continue taking them ? __eou__ Take them for two days.If your symptoms persist for more than two days , you should see a doctor Also , be sure to drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration . __eou__ Thank you for your advice . __eou__
Welcome to our company Mr white . My name is Yan Hua , the secretary of Mr Wang . __eou__ Nice to meet you ! __eou__ Would you like to have a cup of tea or coffee ? __eou__ Thank you . I'd like Chinese tea very much ! __eou__ Glad you like it . By the way , is this your first time to China , Mr . White ? __eou__ Yes , as a representative of IBM . I hope to conclude some business with you . __eou__ We also hope to expand our business with you . __eou__ This is our common desire . __eou__ I think you probably know China has adopted a flexible policy in her foreign trade . __eou__ Yes , I have read about it , but I would like to know more about it . __eou__ Right . Seeing is believing . __eou__ Sure . __eou__
What's wrong ? __eou__ I have a headache . These past few days I've been living off painkillers . Man , I feel like my head is going to explode . __eou__ You should get acupuncture treatment . My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her . __eou__ The results are too slow . On top of that , just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me . __eou__ They don't just randomly stick you , they find your pressure points . The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment , restoring the body's " chi " . __eou__ But I get scared the moment I see a needle . How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end ? __eou__ The needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options . __eou__ Scraping is too terrifying . When they finish scrapping , your body is all red , as if you were just tortured . Cupping is the same , your body ends up with red circles all over . It looks like someone beat you up . __eou__ This only signifies that the toxins have left the body . Actually , there is only discomfort during the treatment process . Once it's over you feel very comfortable . __eou__ Chinese medicine is strange . The patients are already ill , and then the doctor makes them suffer more . __eou__ This is the only way to get at the problem . Anyway , if you want to relieve the pain , you are just going to have to be tough and do it . __eou__ Forget it . I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself . In a little while I'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap . __eou__
Somebody , please answer the phone . __eou__ I've got it . __eou__
Nancy , please turn the TV down . __eou__ Come on , John . This is my favorite show . __eou__ I don't care . I have a headache . __eou__

Excuse me , waiter . Could we change our table for that one ? My wife is quite interested in the scenery . __eou__ I am sorry . That table has been booked . __eou__ It doesn't matter . This one is fine . __eou__
Hello , this is Liu Juan speaking . Is that Mr . Brown ? __eou__ No , this isn't . __eou__ Could you please get him on the phone ? __eou__ Sure . Wait a minute . __eou__
Mom , I'm starving . __eou__ Here are some biscuits . Why are you back so early today ? __eou__ My teacher had a sudden stomachache , so the class was cut shot . You ? __eou__ Me what ? __eou__ You are cooking at least two hours earlier than the usual . __eou__ It's not for us . __eou__ Then it's for Dad , isn't it ? It's so unfair ! __eou__ Don't be a smarty-pants . It's for Grandma Wang . __eou__ What was that again ? __eou__ It's for Grandma Wang . She is sick and her only daughter went abroad weeks ago . So she needs our help . __eou__ I'm sorry , I didn't know that . But I wanna help . __eou__ Umm , let me think for a moment . We can meet her together after I finish cooking . __eou__ I'll get knee to knee with her . __eou__ Good boy . I can only imagine how happy she will be to see you . __eou__
Look , Jimmy's report came today . __eou__ Let's have a look . What is this ? Where are all the grades ? __eou__ He's in the third grade Sam ! You see under each subject that he is being taught in school , he receives a mark from one to three . A one means his achievement or work is excellent . Here in Science for example he got a two , which means its satisfactory . __eou__ What about here in physical education ? __eou__ He got a three here which means it's unsatisfactory . We should work on that with him . __eou__ So confusing ! In my day we got an A or B if we were doing well and if we failed an exam we would get an F ! __eou__
May I serve your dishes now ? __eou__ No , I'm used to having tea first . __eou__ With sugar ? __eou__ No sugar , please . __eou__

What kind of car is best for me ? __eou__ For you , I would recommend this one here . __eou__ The compact ? Why do you think that one is better than the others ? __eou__ This automobile is just right for your needs because not only is it compact for ease in city driving , but also , it has many safety features . I know that as a parent , you are concerned about safety in driving your kids to and from school . __eou__ That's true . What kind of safety features are we talking about ? __eou__ This model features anti-lock brakes , airbags on both driver and passenger sides , and impact collision design . But that's not all . This car isn't only safe but it's also very economical . __eou__ You mean it has a cheaper price than similar models ? __eou__ Yes , this price is very affordable , but driving this car you'll also notice a significant annual saving in gas consumption . The main attraction for this model is the fuel economy . __eou__ With the cost of gasoline these days , that is a big plus . I think this model may be just what I'm looking for . __eou__ Why don't you take it for a test drive , and think it over . __eou__
no , no , you helped me with my computer last week . I want to repay the favor . __eou__ no , it's definitely my turn to treat you ... you paid last time ! __eou__ oh , that was just a quick bite to eat---that doesn't count ! __eou__ ok , ok , how about we just go Dutch ? It's settled . Listen , I'm still pretty new around here , would it be alright if you found the restaurant ? __eou__ ok ... sure . __eou__
I'm afraid I can't complete my paper on time . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ I keep on meeting with difficulties in the experiment . I can hardly go on . __eou__ Where there are difficulties , there are ways to get over them . Hold on ! __eou__
Is that pesky lady coming to the office again ? __eou__ Yeah , I'm afraid so . __eou__ If there's one thing that bugs me , it's her critical attitude . __eou__ Yes , it is annoying . __eou__
Oh , please ! Don't be so old-fashioned ! It's totally safe . __eou__ I sure hope you didn't trust anyone with your credit card number . __eou__ All I did so far was make a bid on the Buddha . It was easy ! __eou__ Easy ? Ha ! ! It was easy for them to cheat you ! ! __eou__ Oh , come on ! I just gave them my e-mail , my address and my phone number . And my name , of course . __eou__
What are you listening now , Fred ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ Hey ! Man , put your earphone out . I said which song you are listening to . __eou__ Jay Chou's title song in his new album . __eou__ What's your comment on his new album ? __eou__ Gorgeous ! There is another song combining Chinese and western music styles . I am crazy for it , so I hear it over and again . And I plan to make it as the ringbone of my mobile . __eou__ Let me enjoy it . __eou__ I suppose this song can be the No . 1 on the top chart . __eou__ I cann't wait for buying his CD now . __eou__
Excuse me . May I come in ? __eou__ Sure . Come on in . __eou__
Sybil . Is that spelt with an I or a Y ? __eou__ Both actually . S , Y , B , I , L . __eou__ Of course . __eou__

Isn't it of strong character ? __eou__ Are you able to compose music ? __eou__ No , not yet . __eou__ Who composed it for your ? __eou__ You needn't ask anyone . You can get on line to search for one . __eou__ Can I get on line to search one , too ? __eou__ Yeah . Web sites provide many melodies for handsets like my ERICSSON . __eou__ What about my SIEMENS ? __eou__ Numerous . It's time that everybody is particular about personality.Find one and change yours . __eou__
When and where were you born ? __eou__ I was born in Beijing in 1965 . __eou__ You look so young . __eou__ Really ? Thank you . __eou__
Someone ’ s told me behind closed door that he is very hot-tempered . __eou__ I ’ m afraid what you were told is not quite right , if you could meet him in person , and you ’ ll know he ’ s very agreeable and capable . __eou__ Really ? I hope to meet him soon . __eou__
What is today ? __eou__ Thursday . __eou__ So the weekend is coming ! How about seeing a film ! __eou__ I'd love to . __eou__
The question is easy for everybody.Don ' t you think so ? __eou__ Yeah , it's very easy . But it's above Nick's head __eou__ Why do you say so ? __eou__ He's always confused by easy questions . __eou__

What do we need to bring ? __eou__ We need to buy some buns for the hot dogs and hamburgers , and I'm making potato salad . __eou__ I'll dig out the Frisbee and my kite from Taiwan . __eou__
Would you mind if I make a suggestion ? __eou__ Of course not , go ahead . __eou__ Maybe you should try to quit smoking . You know it is very bad for your health . __eou__ Well , sure it is . Actually , I have been cutting down the amount since two months ago . I used to smoke a pack of cigarettes for a single day . Now I limit it to 6 cigarettes a day . __eou__ You have made a big progress . Quitting smoking is not an easy job . But it will be rewarding in the long run . __eou__ Thank you for your suggestion . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . __eou__
It's not good for business recently . __eou__ Not good for business ? I don't see eye to eye with you.The new policy offers new opportunities . __eou__ Too risky anyway.It ' s necessary to look before you leap . __eou__
Do you have the day off today ? How come you're not at work now ? __eou__ I don't have the day off . Our labor union is staging a nationwide strike today , all of the workers in our department are supporting the labor union by participating and not going in to work this week . __eou__ Are you serious ? Why would they have to go to such extreme measures like a strike ? Doesn't your company have a pretty good corporate image ? I'll bet the folks at headquarters are going nuts over something as serious as a strike ... __eou__ It happens quite often , actually.Whenever there arises a dispute between the union and the executive group , the first thing they do is to call a strike . Usually it only lasts a day or two before both sides can come to an agreement and we start work again . Anyhow , it's a nice , unanticipated holiday ... __eou__
I can't believe the boss was absent from today's meeting . __eou__ Neither can I . __eou__

See ya ! __eou__ Hold on , with that wind , you ’ re going to catch a cold . Wear this scarf . __eou__ Ok , see you after school ... __eou__ Oh ... and ear muffs ! Put these on ... here we go . __eou__ Mom ? __eou__ Yes , honey ... __eou__ I ... I can ’ t breathe . __eou__
Do you two know each other ? __eou__ Yeah , we were classmates when I was in university . __eou__
Could you introduce to me the man over there ? __eou__ Certainly.Let ' s to and meet him now . __eou__ You're so kind . __eou__
What a wonderful sight ! __eou__ Yes . I've dreamed a thousand times that I could lie down here to relax . __eou__ We are tired of jobs and competition . We need a quiet place . __eou__ I'd like to stay here for all my life if possible . __eou__ So would I .

If we are going to pull our sales numbers up and develop the brand , we got to work across the board . __eou__ It's not just spreading out to new markets that we have to address . I think we'd better first pay attention to developing our brand in the markets we already have.We ' Ve reached the awareness level , but we haven't established customer loyalty . People know who we are , but they still don't trust in our brand . __eou__ I don't see why we can't work on opening new markets and developing the markets we've already penetrated at the same time ... Both aspects of developing our customer base and developing our brand are important . __eou__

The author takes the characters peculiar to the British people as a topic to show that they are quite different from other nationalities . They are quiet , shy and reserved ... __eou__ Excellent . Class is over . Let's have a break . __eou__
Have you considered upgrading your system ? __eou__ Yes , but I'm not sure what exactly I would need . __eou__ You could consider adding a painting program to your software . It would allow you to make up your own flyers and banners for advertising . __eou__ That would be a definite bonus . __eou__ You might also want to upgrade your hardware because it is pretty outdated now . __eou__ How can we do that ? __eou__ You'd probably need a faster processor , to begin with . And you also need a more powerful hard disc , more memory and a faster modem . Do you have a CD-ROM drive ? __eou__ No . __eou__ Then you might want to add a CD-ROM drive too , because most new software programs are coming out on Cds . __eou__ That sounds great . Thanks . __eou__
I visited the Polar Aquarium today . __eou__ Is it like a zoo of polar animals ? __eou__ Almost .

I want to take my kids there some day . too . __eou__
Did you see the fashion awards last night ? __eou__ I sat through about half of it but they lost me after that . __eou__ Not interested ? __eou__ Not really , to be honest . Some of what they call fashion looks terrible to me . __eou__ But they are showing what will be all the rage next year . __eou__ All the rage with whom ? I never see anyone wearing these designs on the street . __eou__ Did you know that fashion is cyclical ? __eou__ What , it keeps coming back ? __eou__ Precisely ! For example , Flares were popular for a while , then went out of fashion . Now we can start to see them coming back in again . __eou__ Flares ? __eou__ They're also known as bell-bottoms . They are a type of trousers . __eou__ It's too complicated . I'll just stick to the plain clothes . __eou__ That's fine , but then you'll always look plain . __eou__

I am having a hard time at my job . __eou__ What's wrong , Julia ? __eou__ My colleagues quickly get promotions , while I always get sidelined . I don't know what to do anymore . __eou__ Don't give up so soon . __eou__ But I don't know what else I can do . I am willing to work hard . Sometimes I make mistakes and the boss is not happy . __eou__ Mistakes are just a lessons to learn from . __eou__ Tell that to my boss . __eou__ Do you know Abraham Lincoln ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ He grew up poor in Kentucky and barely had a year of schooling , but he went on to become the President of United States . __eou__ He was also assassinated because of his views . __eou__ He is known as American's greatest president . Do you know why ? Because he fought against slavery and secession at a time in history where others were too afraid to do anything . He succeeded because of his ambition and generous spirit . __eou__ Well , if he can become president , then I can at least get a promotion . __eou__ That's the spirit . Never give up on your dream . __eou__
Have you applied for you visa to go to study in the united states yet ? __eou__ Yes , I have .

I ’ Ve heard it ’ s very difficult to get a visa to go to the united states . __eou__ The application form are quite complicated . It took me a few hours to fill it out . The hardest thing was getting all the necessary documents . That took almost two weeks . __eou__ What kind of documents did you need to present ? __eou__ I had to show document relating to my financial status and of course my education , because I want a student visa . __eou__ Why do you think so many people have their applications rejected ? __eou__ I think that they don ’ t complete the forms correctly or they don ’ t include all the required documents . The embassy is very strict about it . You have to be quite careful . __eou__ Why are they stricter with Chinese people than with other nationalities ? __eou__ That ’ s simple . Many people break the rules regarding their visa conditions . __eou__

Diana , in your opinion , which is more important , IQ or EQ ? __eou__ Why are you asking me the strange question , Jerry ? __eou__ I watched the movie Forrest Gump last night . And the question just lined in my mind . __eou__ Well . I think IQ matters more . But it won't work without EQ . __eou__ Why ? You seem pretty sure about it . __eou__ Because an intellectual mind can only be a beneficial thing in life . __eou__ But IQ is decided at birth.One can't expect to make a lot of improvement in it . __eou__ That's why people's achievement varies greatly . __eou__ That ' s true , but what if one comes across some difficulties . He must rely on his EQ to deal with them . __eou__ Yes , Jerry , can you share your understanding of EQ ? __eou__ I think it is independent of IQ and plays a prominent role in deciding the way we live our lives . __eou__ Quite right . Have you noticed that a high IQ is not a must for one's success ? __eou__ Just as Forrest ? __eou__ Yes , his IQ is high enough for him to embrace the success as long as he can manage his EQ . __eou__ I got it . __eou__

The government is going to organize a folk-custom activity at the end of the month . And our community is supposed to put on a performance . __eou__ What kind of performance ? A lion dance ? __eou__ Stuff like that but I think the lion dance is a bit too difficult and dangerous . __eou__ Sure , you'll be dancing with lions . What do you expect ? Then what about Range Dance which we did before . __eou__ Good idea . Shall we get everyone in the community ? __eou__ Maybe not . I think we should just focus on the retired people . __eou__ I know that they already have a Range Dance team and then what we need is just to do some rehearsals . __eou__ What about the costumes ? __eou__ We can raise money in the community . You know each family 10 yuan maybe . __eou__ Try something new . We can find a supporting agency . __eou__ Great idea . There is a travel agency nearby who would love to be our sponsor .

What's for dinner ? __eou__ Leftovers . __eou__ What ? Leftovers of what and from when ? __eou__ From last night !

News happened out of expectation . Sometimes I have to get up in the early morning while I can't sleep for editing and interviewing . __eou__ You have to experience this if you want to be an extraordinary reporter . __eou__ That's right . I am still wet behind the ears . __eou__
Hey , Frank . I heard you got a new job . __eou__ Yeah , Judy . I will be working for the Post Office . It ’ s not a bad job . __eou__ Is it true that you have a heavy work schedule ? __eou__ That ’ s right . I report to work at 5am everyday , and I only get 45 minutes for lunch . __eou__ So , why did you apply for such a demanding job ? __eou__ Well , the government offers its employees excellent health insurance benefits . __eou__ Oh , I see .

I think we should home school our children when we decide to have kids . __eou__ What ? Why ? __eou__ Well , our public schools here are not very good and private school are just too expensive . I have been reading up on home schooling and it has a lot of advantages . __eou__ Like what ? I think that by doing something like that we would be isolating our children from social interaction . __eou__ Well , first of all , I would be able to teach them everything they learn in school in a more relaxed and fun way . I also think that having a one-on-one class is much better since you can focus more on his or her strengths or weaknesses . __eou__ I think neither your parents or mine would agree to such an idea . __eou__ I will bring it up over Sunday brunch . __eou__ Good luck with that ! __eou__
Where are you going for your trip ? __eou__ I think Hebes is a good place . __eou__ But I heard the north of China are experiencing severe sandstorms ! __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes , it's said that Hebes was experiencing six degree strong winds . __eou__ How do these storms affect the people who live in these areas ? __eou__ The report said the number of people with respiratory tract infections tended to rise after sandstorms . The sand gets into people's noses and throats and creates irritation . __eou__ It sounds that sandstorms are trouble for everybody ! __eou__ You are quite right . __eou__

I heard the northwest and north of China are experiencing severe sandstorms ! __eou__ I was planning to go to Beijing first and then go to northwest China !

I don't think I've ever encountered winds that strong ! Are the storms affecting land and air transportation ? __eou__ Absolutely ! I don't think any planes are going anywhere . The sand being blown around has cut visibility in Beijing to less than 100 meters . But inseems Gansu Province is being hit the hardest . __eou__ That's exactly where I was planning to go ! __eou__ Well , this storm originated in the plateaus in northwest China . At the moment , that area is calmer . __eou__
So , is L . A . all it's cracked up to be ? __eou__ Well , the stereotype in the movies is that L . A . is a frivolous town with a lot of flaky people . I guess , in the back of my mind , that's what I expected . __eou__ And , is it what you found ? __eou__ Well , it is and it's not . The city of L . A . is much bigger and more diverse than I had expected . There are people here from all over the country and all over world , like New York . I've heard people say that in L . A . , everyone is from somewhere else . Tha's partly true . So , I've met all kinds of people here . What I'm realizing is that the picture of L . A . that's in movies only represents a small segment of the city . __eou__ You're right . Life isn't always like the movies . __eou__

I had broken up with him , how painful I feel . I ’ m going to drown my sorrows . __eou__ I see . But Jane . He ’ s not worth your sorrow and you should restart your new life . __eou__

Will you quit or not ? __eou__ Yes , ma'am . Whatever you say . __eou__

Please get me out of here ! __eou__ Don't panic ! We'll help you get out of the building safely . __eou__ I can smell smoke ! __eou__ Please follow my instructions . Use a wet towel to cover your mouth and nose . Walk quietly to th nearest emergency exit . Now go get the wet towel . __eou__ OK . __eou__ Come with me . __eou__ Sir , I need to go back to get my jewelry box . __eou__ Don't take your personal belongings . We need to get out of the building now ! __eou__ Gosh ! I can see the flames ! __eou__ Crouch down and try not to breathe in the smoke . __eou__

Hi , Nally , are you hungry ? __eou__ I'm starving . Let's go grab a bite . __eou__ Where to ? __eou__ How about Karlis ? __eou__ Are you kidding ? That place is too ritzy for lunch . __eou__ True . ok Let's go to Grumose ? __eou__ Same thing , meals there all coarsen arm and leg . __eou__ I guess it is a little pricy . __eou__ Let's stop it at Multicolor for a quick lunch .. __eou__ That will be Ok . Come on , I can't wait to chow down . __eou__ That was a great lunch , the food was good , but the service was lousy . __eou__ Is that why you stiffed the waiter ? __eou__ You got it . All right , Let's go back to school . __eou__
What kind of note are you taking there . That looks like doodle to me . __eou__ It's picture association of the concept that the professor taught today . __eou__ Does that actually work for you ? __eou__ I don't really know for sure yet . I'll tell you after the test on Friday . __eou__ I like to use shorthand note taking . __eou__ I was told once that the more time you spend writing , the less you are paying attention and so you miss stuff . __eou__ Hmm . I never thought about it that way . __eou__ One time I tried just listening , no notes , no pictures . I think I really learned more that day . __eou__
There is too much traffic in Taipei these days , I think cars should be banned . __eou__ I'm not sure about that . How would people get to work ? __eou__ Well , why not use buses or the MET ? __eou__ Well , it may not be that simple . Not everyone likes public transport . __eou__ Why not ? There is nothing wrong with our buses and trains . __eou__ Well , I don't often use them , I wouldn't really know . __eou__

Have you heard about it ? __eou__ No . The Hills ? Who filed for divorce first ? __eou__ I guess it Is Mrs Hill . She sued for divorce on the grounds of her husband's misconduct with his secretary . __eou__ Oh , maybe not . It's just your guess . Do not give currency to idle gossip . __eou__ OK . I close my mouth . __eou__
Steven , why are you so depressed ? __eou__ I'm feeling very sad . I just read the newspaper . __eou__ What's the news ? __eou__ According to the newspaper , the town was razed by an earthquake and more than 10 thousand people died in the earthquake . __eou__ It's horrible . __eou__ Yeah , we have to do something to help the people in the stricken area . __eou__ Yes . How about donating some money ? __eou__ It's a good idea . But where can we donate money ? __eou__ Just find the answer through Internet . __eou__ Yes , let's do it now . __eou__
I understand your feeling . When someone is feeling at loose ends , we may show mercy on him . This is what we call the " milk of human kindness " . __eou__ That's right . But feeling sorry for someone is one thing , and sticking to our principles is another . We must make a clear cut between them . __eou__ You've take the words out of my mouth . __eou__
I'm feeling wonderful . __eou__ Are you crazy ? The papers make everybody listless . I don't think you are the exception __eou__ I'm no exception , and that's why I spent a whole afternoon in the swimming pool . __eou__ I'd better exercise my body too.My limbs are rusty now . __eou__
Can you give me more details on what is included in the package ? __eou__ Sure . The coach leaves at 6:30 a . m . , in front of our office .

Give these sales figures a look . It's pretty depressing . We're way in the red this year . We can't afford to keep going like this for much longer . __eou__ You're right , we need to start making money soon , or at least manage to break even . But I think that the market is slowly beginning to heat up--sales are bound to pick up any time now . __eou__ Deman is dropping . The problem is our competition . They are monopolizing the market ! __eou__ Maybe we should rethink our marketing strategy to include the possibility that our new line of cosmetics could be a big seller . __eou__ It's really too early to tell , but a lot is riding on the new products . If we don't do better after the product launch , we may have to go bankrupt . __eou__ Do you think it's that serious ? __eou__ Look at this numbers and see for yourself . Read'sm and weep . __eou__ My goodness , I didn't realize it was that bad . __eou__
Would you like to rent the house ? __eou__ You bet , as long as I can collect enough money . __eou__ I can lend some to you . __eou__ Aren't you crazy ? __eou__

Could you give any reasons for your choice ? Can you explainwhy do you put medicine first ? __eou__ Well , doctors are such an important job . I mean your health is the most imponent thing you've got , isn't it ? I want to be important and help people . __eou__ Yes . I suppose so . __eou__
There are things that are actually even smaller than atoms . __eou__ What are those ? __eou__ They are the things that make up the atom , such as electrons and protons . __eou__ Is there anything that is smaller than electrons and protons ? __eou__ Of course there is . Things can be divided and broken down into indefinitely small parts if we can . __eou__ I really don't want to know about this . Physics gives me a headache . __eou__
I wish I had access to the public library . __eou__ it's easy ! Just go and get a card . __eou__

I only think she ’ s pretty and intelligent . Of course , she ’ s diligent , too . __eou__ That ’ s enough for you to worship the ground she treats on . __eou__
Has Robert ever missed coming to one of our parties ? __eou__ Only once or twice at the most . __eou__ Do you know why ? __eou__ I have no idea . __eou__
My mother and my wife are always holding different ideas . __eou__ If you are really in love with your wife , you should be in support of her . You can ’ t have it both ways , of course . __eou__ You mean I should please her by following her suggestion . __eou__ Yeah . Love me , and love my dog . __eou__

did you know that abortion is still illegal in many states in the USA ? __eou__ why ? I thought Americans were supposed to be more open than that . __eou__ well , for many religious people , they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers . __eou__ do you think most people in America believe that abortion is wrong ? __eou__ no , I think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions . __eou__ it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in America . __eou__ religious people blame it on pre-marital sex , not on abortion being illegal . __eou__ what do you think about abortion ? __eou__ I personally would never want to have one , but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself . __eou__ do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ? __eou__ I know this is going to sound sexist , but I don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children . __eou__ why not ? It's their children , too . __eou__ that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . Men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand . __eou__ that might be true , but I think men should have some kind of say in the matter . __eou__

' __eou__ How about playing tennis with me ? __eou__ Good idea . I will take the racket . __eou__
What was the party like last night , Jean ? __eou__ Not bad at all , thanks . There were one or two interesting people there.Why couldn't you come ? __eou__ Well , I couldn't get away from work early . And when . I got home I had a headache , so I had to go straight to bed . But I was over-tired , because I wasn't able to get to sleep for hours . __eou__ What a shame . Why didn't you take a sleeping pill ? __eou__ I don't like them . I used to take them when I had to work overtime , you know . __eou__ How many did you use to take ? __eou__ Three every night . __eou__ Good heavens . Why did you take so many ? __eou__ Because I was under a terrible strain . The doctor saidthey weren't very strong . Anyway , I used to feel awful the next morning . __eou__ I'm sure you did . __eou__ The doctor said I had to be careful . __eou__ He was quite right . __eou__ So I stopped drinking coffee late at night instead . __eou__
Hello ! You're welcome to Guangzhou Fair . __eou__ Thank you . I'm from America . Here is my business card . __eou__ Glad to meet you , Mr . Smith . My name is Wang and here is my name card . I'll be glad to do what I can for you . __eou__ Great ! This is my first visit to the Fair . Everything is new to me . Would you please give me some information ? __eou__ Glad to . The Fair is a big gathering taking place twice a year , thousands of businessmen from more than a hundred and fifty countries and regions are here to trade with China . __eou__ What about your company ? __eou__ Ours is a company special in exporting leather products . And what about yours ? __eou__ My firm has high standing in my country . My bank is the City Bank , New York . You may refer to it for my status . __eou__
Excuse me , what's your name ? __eou__ My name is Jessica .

Mandy , Would you like to come for dinner tonight ? __eou__ Dinner ? Where ? __eou__ At the new Five Spices restaurant in Chaoyang . __eou__ What kind of food do they serve ? __eou__ It ’ s Asian fusion . I heard it ’ s delicious . __eou__ Oh really ! That sounds lovely . __eou__
It seems that something is praying heavy on you.What ’ s the matter ? __eou__ I got my father ’ s goat last night . __eou__ What did you do to get his goat ? __eou__ When I asked him to treat me like he does to my sisters , he jumped down my throat . So I took it out on him by telling him what I thought . __eou__
How do you think the transport system in our city could be improved ? __eou__ I think that the public transport system could be made simpler . I never know where the bus routes actually go . The routes seem to twist and turn rather than going roughly in a straight line . __eou__ I think we just need to build more roads . Then there would be more space for cars to drive and we ’ d have fewer traffic jams . __eou__ If we built more roads , people would just fill them with cars again . I think we should discourage people from using their cars . __eou__ How would you do that ? __eou__ I think we should do a few things at once . Improving public transport would encourage people to use that . If we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre , they won ’ t use their cars as much . __eou__ I don ’ t know . I think it ’ s unfair to make drivers pay more money . They already pay a lot of tax-petrol tax , for example . __eou__ I think that they should pay more tax . Look at the damage they cause to the environment and people ’ s health by discharging all those exhaust fumes . __eou__ The air would certainly be cleaner if there were fewer cars being used in the city . The problem is that people will see it as reducing their freedom . It well be unpopular . __eou__ That ’ s a good point . Car owners will probably be against it , but people who use public transport will be in favor of it . __eou__
Hi , Jack . Long time no see ! __eou__ Yeah . How's everything going ? __eou__ Not bad . At least I am still alive . __eou__ Just alive ? I guess you are some lucky guy . I heard you are going out with Jane . __eou__ Where did you get that idea ? __eou__ Oh , come on . Jane is a very nice girl , someone you meet only once till lifetime . __eou__ You are right . I am not boasting , but she is really as beautiful as she is intelligent . __eou__ Well , I really envy you for finding such a nice girl . __eou__
Hey , look at my new shirt . What do you think about it ? __eou__ Just so-so . Where did you get it ? __eou__ I bought it on a street market . A real bargain ! __eou__ I'd much rather buy expensive but good quality clothing , because it is not only nice but lasts a long time . __eou__
All right then , Ms . Montgomery . I ’ ll get those plans over to your office by Thursday afternoon . __eou__ Great . That will give me time to talk with my staff before I make final decision . __eou__ That ’ s what I was thinking . I ’ ll have them there by Thursday . __eou__ Good news . Thanks for getting things done so quickly . __eou__
Fred , have you made the plan for April 28th ? __eou__ Yes , sir . Shall I explain the details of the plan now ? __eou__ You go ! __eou__ According to your schedule , you will visit the Times Company , including its office building , workshops and stores , in the morning from 8: 30 to 11 __eou__ Is there anything after the meeting ? In that case , would you add one plan ? I want to visit our guest Mr . Ross after the meeting . Can you arrange it for me ? __eou__

Would you be willing to meet the extra cost if we meet your additional requirements ? __eou__ Well , if you can meet our deadline . __eou__ That shouldn't be a problem , as long as we can make ends meet . __eou__ I also hope your quality will meet our standard . __eou__ We never fail to meet our client's expectation . __eou__ Excellent . We will meet all your conditions if you can meet our demands . __eou__
Mark ? I need that file you took yesterday . __eou__ I ’ m sorry , Janet . I left it at home .

I ’ ll go home and get it at noon , all right ? __eou__
Oh , sir . I lost my passport . __eou__ Do you remember when and where you last saw it ? __eou__ I remember I saw when I was dining in the Aidan Restaurant . When I paid the bill , I saw it in my handbag . __eou__ Could you please tell me your passport number ? __eou__ 3448-2691- 6429-34 . __eou__ And what is the expiration date on your passport ? __eou__ Five months later . __eou__ I see . Please fill out this form . And you need to contact your embassy or consulate to report it as soon as possible . __eou__
Hi . What's your name ? __eou__ My name is Jung Min . What's your name ? __eou__ My name is Jessica . It's nice to meet you . __eou__ Yes . It's nice to meet you too . Are you a new student too ? __eou__ No . I'm a sophomore . I take it you are a new student ? __eou__ Yeah . It's pretty exciting to be here . __eou__ Have fun while it lasts . The excitement wears off real quick . Especially after you see how much homework you get . Where are you from ? __eou__ I'm from Korea . My parents wanted me to go to an American university , so I came here . __eou__ I have never been to Korea . I've been to Japan before , but never Korea . __eou__ Why were you in Japan ? __eou__ My father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country . He's so into learning about different cultures . __eou__ That's pretty cool . __eou__ I thought it would have been more fun if I went without my parents . __eou__ Well , if you ever want to visit Korea , I would be happy to show you around . __eou__ Thanks for the offer . I'll keep that in mind . Oh , the professor is coming . We'll talk more after class . __eou__ Ok . __eou__
We agree to give you a break on the price , all together a discount of 6 % . Good news is , I talked to my boss , he confirmed that if you take care of the shipping costs , we'll throw in insurance . __eou__ Great ! I'd love to get a little better discount than 6 % , but if your company provides the insurance , that will save us a few bucks ... __eou__ Now , all this is available to you , as far as you make payment within a 30 day grace period . That shouldn't be a problem , right ? __eou__ No ... We shouldn't have any problem with that . I know we talked about a possibility for 90 days , but we won't be needing that after your discounted price . __eou__ So , if all this is agreeable to you , I'll put it all down on paper and fax a contract to you this afternoon . If you can get a signed version of the contract we've agreed upon back to me by tomorrow morning , we can go ahead and make arrangements to ship the product on Tuesday . __eou__ Great ! __eou__
Do you know anything about health food ? __eou__ It is so popular among people to preserve health now , so I read some books about health food . __eou__ Can you give me some examples ? __eou__ Drinking warm and fresh water in the morning on wakening up is one of ways to keep healthy . __eou__ Really ? Why we must have warm and fresh water ? __eou__ Warm water can be good for your stomach , which is empty at that moment . And freshness can keep the water active to clean your digest system . __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ Yogurt , because it has protein , vitamins and it is acidic . If you drink it everyday , your stomach will be more comfortable . __eou__
I'm after some chinese incense burner ? How's this one ? __eou__ How's this one ? __eou__ Oh , I need a small one , otherwise my luggage will be overweight . __eou__ What about this one ? __eou__ Oh , this is fine . __eou__
Oh , no ! My stub ! I can't believe it — I flushed it down the toilet ! __eou__ Excuse me , madam ! You parked in the handicapped spot . __eou__ But , but ... it was really an emergency ! And , my stub ... __eou__ Don't tell me you lost it . __eou__ Ah , umm , kind of . __eou__ That was quick . __eou__ Well , I , umm , I flushed it ... __eou__
Hi , Tom . You forgot to put on your sports shoes ! It's Games Day today ! __eou__ Well , I have them in my bag . I'Il put them on right away ! __eou__ Let me give you a hand . You are carrying so many books . __eou__ Thanks ! __eou__ Have you forgotten the cheers ? __eou__ No , I haven't . I've tried hard to remember and I'm quite sure I've memorized the rhythm correctly . __eou__ That's good ! __eou__
Can you tell me something about financial aid ? __eou__ What exactly ? __eou__ How to apply for it ? __eou__ In your first letter , that is , when you apply for admission , you should also tell them you need their financial aid . __eou__ Then ... __eou__ If the aid is available , they will give you two or more application forms , One is for admission , the others are for the aid . __eou__ What if not ? __eou__ They will tell you the aid is impossible . __eou__
Where's Mrs . Johnson ? __eou__ Just call her Lisa , Mary . She's cooking dinner . __eou__ I see . Can I sit down ? __eou__ Of course ! Make yourself at home . __eou__ Thank you , Mr . Johnson . __eou__ Please , just call me Tom . __eou__ Okay , Tom . __eou__ Where's Cindy ? __eou__ She's upstairs in my room . __eou__ Can you tell her to come downstairs ? We're about to have dinner . __eou__
I was just about to go to bed when the telephone rang last night . __eou__ Who was it ? __eou__ Kate . She said she was too excited to go to sleep . __eou__ She never cares about others . __eou__ It ’ s true . Guess what we were talking about last night . __eou__ Her new boyfriend , right ? __eou__ Yeah , how do you know about that ? __eou__ I was also interrupted by her last week because of such a thing . __eou__
Do you think what I did to Elvin was out of line ? __eou__ You could have tried to explain to him about the new programmers . __eou__ Elvin doesn't want any programming help . He wants all the glory for himself . __eou__ You might be right . He does think pretty highly of himself . __eou__ Did you hear the names he was calling me ? __eou__ I heard . But did you have to tear out his nose ring ? __eou__
I am really impressed with your presentation skills . __eou__ Thank you . I have been working on it for several years . __eou__ Well , your time has been well spent ! __eou__ It also helps that I have strong team members , such as yourself . You really know your stuff ! __eou__ Thanks , but I have to admit I am really good at bluffing ! __eou__
Wow ! It ’ s packed . __eou__ The train station is indeed crowded . I think it ’ s hard for us to get on the train . __eou__
What day is it ? __eou__ It's Monday , October 27 . Speaking of dates , when are you leaving ? __eou__ I'm leaving on November 10th . __eou__ Isn't it a Sunday ? __eou__ No , it's a Monday . __eou__ So you are leaving two weeks from now ? __eou__ Right . __eou__
Mark , you've been coming home late these days . What are you busy doing ? __eou__ Nothing important . I've been working overtime lately . __eou__ How many hours do you work each day now ? __eou__ 12 hours , including 5 hours overtime . __eou__ That's tough indeed ! Do you think your health can afford ? __eou__ I don't care . I need money . __eou__ Surely you'll be paid extra for overtime , but do you think it's really worth ? __eou__ Yes , I think so . When I work overtime I'm paid time and a half . __eou__ Oh , yes . Money comes faster in that way than otherwise . __eou__ But jobs with a lot of overtime are quite limited . Employers usually don't like to pay for overtime if they can manage . __eou__ That's true . __eou__
This city is far too polluted . We should do something about it . __eou__ I agree . We need to recycle our trash and use public transportation more often . __eou__
How can I live without Helen ? __eou__ Get a hold of yourself , Bruce . You'll get over her eventually . __eou__
Hey Sarah . Why are you limping ? __eou__ Oh . Hi Matt . I went snowboarding yesterday and my whole body aches . __eou__ Was it your first time ? __eou__ Yeah . And I never want to go again . __eou__ I remember the first time I went . My back was sore , I couldn't sit down because it hurt my butt , and my legs would cramp if I walked too fast . __eou__ That's exactly how I feel now . __eou__ It's only like that the first couple of times . __eou__ Ha . There won't be a next time . __eou__ You gotta give it a chance . It's fun after awhile . __eou__ I'll think about it after I start feeling better . Right now , I don't even want to hear the word snowboarding . __eou__
Look , it's all water over the dam now . Let's leave it behind us . __eou__ Yeah , I know , but it's too hard to do . __eou__ Our eyes should look into the future . We could not live in the past . __eou__ Only sometimes when I think about it , I feel very sad . __eou__ It's normal . Time will change everything . __eou__
You are starting to learn English ? __eou__ Yeah . I like it , Dad . __eou__ You ’ re lucky you start to learn it so easily . I learned English very late , and learned it all by myself . At that time we didn ’ t have a good English studying environment . I have to keep my dictionary on hand . __eou__ Really ? __eou__
What have you been up to , Johnny ? __eou__ You know-sweeping , scrubbing , washing , drying , waxing , polishing ... __eou__ Wow , your grandma's really having a field day with you , huh ? __eou__ You got that right ... and my mom's still mad about what we did with the dishes . __eou__ You have all the fun , don't you ? __eou__ Listen , I'd better get back to the grindstone . __eou__ Sure thing , Johnny . Watch out for dishpan hands there , kid ! __eou__
I go to the fitness center every weekend . __eou__ What for ? __eou__ To lose some weight . __eou__ Why , you look pretty all right . __eou__
Do you know anyone who ’ s had plastic surgery ? __eou__ You mean like a breast enlargement ? I don't think that's really necessary . That's not the way a woman should stay attractive . __eou__ Why not ? Why can't we go back to the way things were ? __eou__ Because ... I don't know . But , Connie , you wouldn't do that , would you ? __eou__ Darned right I would ! __eou__ Maybe make-up would be enough ? __eou__ Come on , Liz . Be open-minded ! Look at my eyes , they are puffy . And my eye bags , they are dark and loose and full of lines and circles . I really hope surgery can wipe out the tired feelings . __eou__ But what would other people think ? __eou__ I don't care what other people think . I am ready for a lift . __eou__
When will we leave here ? __eou__ I can ’ t give you a definite answer . Let ’ s play it by ear . __eou__
Waiter , come here please . Could we have a doggie bag ? __eou__ Sure . Wait a moment . __eou__
Will you send the letter to the chairman of the committee ? __eou__ I should be most delighted . __eou__ Thank you , Mr . White . __eou__ Delighted I was able to help . __eou__
Do you have your own circle of friends ? __eou__ Yes . I have friends even though I am a man of few words . Just like the old saying goes , " Actions speak louder than words " . I am a hard-working silent person . __eou__ What you said was right , but we need to work as a team , how could you make adjustment to that ? __eou__ Teamwork is ok to me , and I hope the team will be complementary in personality . __eou__ OK , I got it . __eou__
My accounts go where I go . Vince knows that . __eou__ Wow . You are a real snake . __eou__ It's business , Dave . __eou__ I know , I know . Kill , or die , right ? __eou__ Right . The faint of heart should not apply . __eou__ I really feel sorry for that rhumba boy if he ever identifies himself . __eou__ So do I . __eou__
All right , Mr . Crane , when will you be arriving in the city ? __eou__ I should be coming in on the 11:30 mooring flight . How far is the office from the airport ? __eou__ Only 25 minutes or so . We ’ ll send somebody to meet you . That ’ s 11:30 a . m . Friday the 15th ? __eou__ That ’ s right . I ’ ll be in the baggage area . __eou__
So , tell me , what makes you think we should give you a raise ? __eou__ I've got several good reasons . I've been here several years , my work has proven to be good , and I've noticed that people in comparable jobs get paid more than I do . __eou__ Salaries are confidential , how do you know how much money these " other people " make ? __eou__ Well , I've noticed all the new cars around here , for one thing . __eou__ Those are company cars provided to the sales staff for their business trips . Also , some employees receive sales commissions . So good salesmen will naturally earn more . __eou__ That's understandable . Well , rather than comparing my salary with someone else's , perhaps we could talk about my job performance . Surely you've noticed the extra hours I've put in recently ? __eou__ I see your point . However , it might be hard to get a raise approved . Profits were down last quarter , and the whole company is tightening its belt , so anything that affects the annual budget __eou__ That would be very good of you , Mr . White . __eou__
what do you hope to do when you finish university ? __eou__ I ’ d like to go into management . I ’ Ve applied for several jobs already and I ’ m hopeful that I ’ ll get some job offers . How about you ? __eou__ after I graduate , I have to do some more studies to pass exams to become a lawyer . I think I ’ Ve got a good chance of passing . There ’ s a possibility of getting a job with a law firm in London , provide __eou__ we both have to overcome several obstacles if we are to achieve our ambitions . __eou__ if life were easy , then we ’ d achieve our ambition quickly and then get bored . __eou__ unfortunately , it ’ s inevitable that some people are going to work hard yet not succeed . __eou__ that ’ s why ambition need to be realistic . You can ’ t achieve something that ’ s totally unrealistic . __eou__ as long as you plan carefully , most thing are possible . It ’ s always good to have a backup plan in case things go wrong . __eou__ I think it ’ s important to be successful in a field you are truly interested in , not something that other people force you to be interested it . __eou__ my father wanted me to become a doctor , but I knew it would be impossible for me to be successful in that field . __eou__ I hope my parents don ’ t try to interfere in my choice of career . __eou__
Hello , Alice . Would you like to go to the temple fair with me ? __eou__ Temple fair ? __eou__ Yes . The ancient custom of holding temple fairs is to offer sacrifices to the god of the earth , and they have developed into a festival filled with food , performances and games now . __eou__ Sounds interesting ! __eou__ Absolutely , I love temple fairs . Beijing has several temple fairs recently . They are different from each other to some extent , but also have a lot in common . __eou__ I just can't wait to see them . Which one do you choose today ? __eou__ What about Tianqiao Temple Fair ? A variety of opera performances , acrobatics shows , and food will dazzle you . __eou__ Great ! Do you know how to get there ? __eou__ Of course . __eou__ Couldn't be better . __eou__
Hi . I ’ m here for flight 514 returning to Beijing but the board shows there is a delay.How long of a delay is expected ? __eou__ So far it looks like we will be leaving two hours late , but keep checking the departing flights status board just in case . __eou__ Do you think it ’ s safe to leave to get a quick bite ? __eou__ I think you should stay in the airport . Even though the delay is expected to be two hours , the flight departure could be announced any minute . Who knows ? __eou__ What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ It seems there are some loose bolts on one of the wings . It happens all the time . No need to worry . __eou__ Umm ... You know ... Actually I was thinking of trying another airline . No need to hold my seat . __eou__
I have found it quite different here from China since I came to the United States . __eou__ What's the difference ? __eou__ Some friends of mine took me to the mall to go shopping . It was so big . I think I could get lost if I went there alone . __eou__ You must have bought many things in the mall ? __eou__ Not really many . I was told that on weekends there were always the flea markets , so I decided to come to the flea market to buy a bargain . __eou__ It's wise to do it . The Americans have the habit of selling their junk when they are moving to another place , so they usually display all the things they want to sell in their gardens at the weekend . And many things they are selling still look quite new and they are also very useful . __eou__ I have heard about it while in China . it is called a " yard sale " . I didn't have any idea of that until today when I came here to the big " yard sale " . __eou__ You must have got many useful things for your new apartment . __eou__
Mr . : Are you Mary Lin ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Mr . : I'm Mr . Rogers , your homeroom teacher . __eou__ Where should I sit ? __eou__ Mr . : Why don't you sit behind Brad ? __eou__ Who's Brad ? __eou__ Mr . : He's that guy in the blue shirt . __eou__ When does the first period begin , by the way ? __eou__ Mr . : As soon as the bell rings after the morning announcement . __eou__
Oh ! __eou__ What fools we were ! __eou__ To think of it ! All my old silver ! It meant so much to me . __eou__ And my new car . To think that he simply drove off with everything in my car . That's what hurts me most . __eou__ What's so terrible too , is the fools we've made of ourselves . __eou__ I hardly dare call the police . They'll just laugh at us . __eou__ I'll never get over it . Oh , Harry , it was all so unnecessary . That man ! ! How could he do this to us after we'd put him up ? __eou__ And his story didn't even hold together . I feel such an idiot . __eou__
Scientists have found a second solar system in the universe . __eou__ What's the second solar system ? __eou__ It's just a system like ours , with a star and a number of planets going around it . __eou__ Is this good news or bad news ? __eou__ It's exciting news ! If we find a second solar system , we might find a second earth ! __eou__ You mean with people on it ? __eou__ Yes ! Isn't that exciting ? __eou__
I ’ m fed up with marriage . __eou__ Why do you say so ? Everyone admires that you have a good wife . __eou__ Oh , no . When we were poor , we often tried our best to make ends meet . It was a hard time . __eou__ But now you are rich . __eou__ And we have some squabbles on some boring things . __eou__ This is ordinary marriage life . __eou__
How do I use this adhesive ? __eou__ This is a special adhesive for easing the pain . Apply it to the painful area and change it in every 2 days . __eou__ How do I use the lotion ? __eou__ Apply some of the ointment , and rub it into the skin . __eou__ Well , thanks very much . __eou__ Not at all . __eou__
I heard you will be going on a business trip . __eou__ Yes , I must go to Shanghai to attend a meeting about our plan . __eou__ How long will you be away ? __eou__ Six days or so . __eou__ Who will take your place ? __eou__ Harry . He has been assisting me on the plan . __eou__ Good choice . He is competent for the position . __eou__ Yes , he is familiar with the plan . __eou__
The NASDAQ gained a few points today . __eou__ Does it mean anything ? __eou__ It's hard to say . The stock market is weird . You never know what will happen tomorrow . __eou__ Why do you buy stocks , then ? __eou__ It's a kind of investment . If I choose a good stock and hold it long enough , I can get good returns . __eou__
How do you want your hair cut ? __eou__ I want it the way Peckham wears it . __eou__ Who is Peckham ? __eou__ Are you kidding me ? Even the girls know Peckham . Whatever , I have a picture of him here . __eou__ You are a big fan of him ! He has strong legs . __eou__ Sure , he is a soccer star . __eou__ Hey , wake up . It's done . How do you like it ? __eou__ Oh , my God . It's disaster . It makes my head look like a soccer ball . __eou__ But it's the same hairstyle . __eou__ It looks like the hairstyle of Kahn who stands beside him in the picture . __eou__ Oh . I made a mistake . I thought the guy on the right was Peckham . __eou__ He plays outside right but it doesn't mean he has to stand on the right . __eou__ Sorry , but do not worry . I think I can fix it . Just cut a little more off the temple . __eou__ Do it , please . __eou__
What's special for today ? __eou__ Sweet and sour pro chops , Madam . __eou__ We'll have it for two people . __eou__ In a minute , Madam . __eou__

Are you ill ? __eou__ No , I am not ill . __eou__ Then , What ’ s the matter with you my child ? __eou__ Nothing . __eou__ Oh , come on , baby . Tell me what happened . __eou__ I ... I failed to pass the examination . How I wish I had studied hard . __eou__ Oh . Take it easy . You can set your aim from today . __eou__ Ok , Mum . I will not fail the examination next time . __eou__
Do you mind if I ask you a question ? __eou__ No , not at all . Go ahead . __eou__ What do you do in order to improve your English ? __eou__ I go to movies ; I go to lectures ; I listen to the radio ; I do lots of things . Most importantly , I practice every chance I get . __eou__ It ’ s a good idea to have a radio , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Sure . It ’ s like understanding on the telephone — — you can ’ t see the speaker ! It ’ s great for improving listening comprehension . __eou__ It takes a long time to learn a language , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__ It certainly does . But if you practice speaking every spare minute and learn useful sentences every day you can make big progress . __eou__
The trouble is not that . It is that he may suddenly remember something I promised him a couple of weeks ago , out of a clear blue sky . Then he complains that I have gone back on my words . __eou__ Does he do that with his Dad ? I mean , does he complain things to his father ? __eou__ He never does , and in fact , he seldom communicates with him . __eou__ But didn ’ t you say that his Dad takes him under his wings ? __eou__ Yes , I did . He only takes side with him . He seldom asks what Dick is doing . __eou__
Nicole , your Fettucini is very ... unique . __eou__ But not as good as your mother's , right ? __eou__ Actually , it's better ... __eou__ What ? Are you kidding ? __eou__ No . It was the only dish she wasn't good at . So we could use you as the new head chef ... __eou__ Oh , Uncle Giovanni . That's wonderful ! Thank you ! Thank you ! __eou__ OK , OK . Get back to work . There's someone waiting for you in the kitchen ... __eou__
How's your new work , Carl ? __eou__ A tough job . They even offer in-service training every Wednesday afternoon . __eou__ Good for you . __eou__ I don't like it . I am not used to this kind of 9 to 5 work hours . Above all , I hate talking to those poker faces everyday . __eou__ Well , you have to take the bad with the good . __eou__ I guess so . I am badly off and I need this job . __eou__
Let me clear away the broken glass . __eou__ No , I can manage it myself.Just sit down , please . __eou__ It's very careless of me to have broken your glass . __eou__ Never mind . __eou__
Mary , I think we should stop seeing each other . __eou__ But , Bob , we were so good together . __eou__ I'm sorry but it's for the best . __eou__ I don't understand . We were getting along so well . __eou__
Okay , show me your card hand . Here's mine . I have three Kings and a pair of Aces . __eou__ How did you get that ? No need to show you my hand , I lose.This is not as much fun as the music concert we just saw . __eou__ Thanks again for buying the tickets . That was the most exciting live concert I've ever seen . That silver electric guitar was really cool . __eou__ They're quite popular now . Wasn't her voice good ? __eou__ That , My Heart Will Go On . It warms my heart . you know , JanetJackson , Shanna Twain and Celine Dion are so very different . __eou__ Janet Jackson is more pop music.Shania sings country music . Celine just seems to hit all the right notes . __eou__ Have you heard Maria Carey ? __eou__ Yes , l have two of her Cds , l'II lend them to you if you like . __eou__ Excellent . You can borrow my Janet Jackson's CD . It's her new one . __eou__ I hope you have a good stereo . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because you have to hear it really loud to get the full concert effect . __eou__
It depends on where you are and what position you are in . For instance , if you are in an elevator and you smile , you will make other takers uncomfortable . __eou__ That ’ s an exception . But I am fed up with those who keep a straight face in front of me . __eou__ I cannot see eye to eye with you here . You see , I am fed up with those who keep smiling to me . I mean , they smile for no reason at all . __eou__ That means you don ’ t like them . If you hit it off with them , you will like to see their smiles . __eou__
What's the weather today ? __eou__ It's fine today . __eou__ What was the weather like yesterday ? __eou__ It rained all day yesterday . The weather was awful last week . __eou__ What will the weather be like tomorrow ? __eou__ It's going to be sunny tomorrow . __eou__
So , did you go out with Richard ? __eou__ Yeah . We went to a movie last Saturday . We saw Police Partners II . __eou__ Did you like it ? __eou__ Richard did , but I didn't . Of course , I told him I liked it . __eou__ Yeah . So did you do anything else ? __eou__ Well , we went to a dance club . __eou__ Did you have fun there ? __eou__ Yeah , we had a great time . And we're going to go there again next week ! __eou__
Are you all right ? __eou__ I will be all right soon . I was terrified when I watched them fall from the wire . __eou__ Don't worry.He is an acrobat 。 __eou__ I see . __eou__
Daniel , have you ever heard about the wildlife sanctuary ? __eou__ Is that different from this kind of zoo ? __eou__ Yes , of course . __eou__ So tell me about it ! __eou__ There are a lot of wild animals in that place , and also some special rules while visiting . __eou__ Special rules ? __eou__ There , you only have two ways for visiting . __eou__ Details ? __eou__ On their bus or in your own cars , and you won't be allowed to get off the bus until you reach the special region . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Because it is dangerous to get out of the car or bus . You can just imagine how fierce the wild animals can be . __eou__ That makes sense . But that sounds interesting . Is there one in Beijing too ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I prefer to go there next time . __eou__ Yeah , sure , you won't be disappointed . __eou__
Where do you spend the weekend ? __eou__ We've a country house . __eou__ That's nice . __eou__ Join us , will you ? __eou__ That'd be great ! Thank you . __eou__
Do you have everything ? __eou__ Let's see ... my ID card , my passport , and my suitcase . I'm pretty sure I've got everything . __eou__
Excuse me , have you got any laundry ? The laundryman is here to collect it . __eou__ Yes , I have . Here are my blouse , coats and stockings . __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ Oh , yes . My husband also has some laundry . This is his suit and here is his pajamas . __eou__ Are they to be dry-cleaned ? __eou__ Oh , no . Only the suit and coat are to be dry-cleaned . I want to have my blouse tomorrow evening . And I'd like the collar and cuffs starched . __eou__ Yes , but not too stiff , right ? __eou__ Exactly . Is it possible to have my overcoat dry-cleaned , too ? __eou__ There are a few spots on it . I am afraid you will not have it tomorrow . Dry-cleaning usually takes three days . __eou__ Oh , no . I also need this tomorrow evening . __eou__ In that case , I suppose I could ask the dry-cleaner to clean up the spots for the moment , and have it well pressed . You might get it back on time then . __eou__ That's a good idea . __eou__ By the way , a cotton came off your shirt you gave me the day before yesterday . __eou__ Yes , I noticed it yet . __eou__ The laundry has sewed on a new button for you . __eou__ Oh , thanks a lot . __eou__ I am afraid the new one is not exactly the same as the others . __eou__ Never mind , it doesn't matter . __eou__ If you have any more laundry , please just leave it in the laundry bag behind the bathroom door . The laundryman comes to collect it every morning . __eou__
Hello . I want to reconfirm our flight to London . __eou__ Yes , sir . Did you call the airline ? __eou__ Yes , I did . But I couldn't communicate with them in English.They speak only Spanish.So I need your help . __eou__ Certainly , sir . What is the flight number and when are you leaving ? __eou__ We are taking IB 385 to London tomorrow at 1 p . m . __eou__ Oh , I see , sir . We have the airline office inside the hotel . They have an English-speaking staff . Just dial 35 , please . __eou__
Hi , Yang Tang . Come in ! Pretty hot out there , isn't it ? Did you have trouble finding us ? Sit ! Sit ! __eou__ Hello , Mr . Jones , its ... __eou__ Yang Tang , just call me Fred ! Everyone does . __eou__ Ei , OK , er .. Fred . Thank you for seeing me today . __eou__ No problem . No problem at all . Say , it says here in your resume you studied in California . Great place , isn ’ t it ? I studied in California myself . I really enjoyed it . What did you like most about California ? __eou__ Well , I ... I guess the weather . And the people . They were all very friendly to me . __eou__ Yeah , the people are quite relaxed ... Those were some great times I spent there . Well , thanks for stopping by . Are you from King Dao , Yang Tang ? __eou__ Yes , I am . I was born here , and still live with my parents in the same house . __eou__ Is that right ? Wonderful , wonderful . I've been in King Dao for two years now . A great place . Nice people and great beer ! Well , I guess we ’ d better get started . __eou__
You look upset , anything wrong ? __eou__ I'm going to quit the job . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ The task is tough . __eou__ You'd look before you leap . __eou__ Thanks for your concern . __eou__
Okay , so let ’ s go over everything one more time . I really want you to get this job ! __eou__ I know ! It ’ s an amazing growth opportunity ! They ’ re true industry leaders , and it would be so interesting to be part of an organization that is the undisputed leader in business process platform development . __eou__ So , let ’ s see , you did your research on the company , right ? __eou__ Well , I visited their website and read up on what they do . They ’ re an IT service company that offers comprehensive business solutions for large corporations . They provide services such as ARM development , and they also offer customdesigned applications . __eou__ So what would your role in the company ? __eou__ Well , the position is for an account manager . That basically means that I would be the link between our and our development team . __eou__ Sounds good , and so , why do you want to work with them ? __eou__ Well , as I said they ’ re the industry leaders , they have a really great growth strategy , amazing development opportunities for employees , and it seems like they have strong corporate governance . They ’ re all about helping companies grow and unleashing potential . I guess their core values and mission really resonated with me . Oh , and they offer six weeks ’ vacation , stock options and bonuses ... I ’ m totally going to cash in on that . __eou__ You idiot ! Don ’ t say that ! Do you want this job , or not ? __eou__
Let ’ s meet before next week ’ s meeting , Jane . I want to kick around some ideas with you . __eou__ No problem . I ’ Ve got a really light week . Anytime ’ s fine by me . __eou__ Well , let ’ s plan to get together next Monday afternoon , around three ? __eou__ All right , I ’ ll put you in my book . __eou__
Emily , are you getting rushed by a sorority ? __eou__ More than one . I think the count is now three , if I remember correctly . __eou__ Wow . I'm getting rushed too , but just one . Are you thinking of joining any of them ? __eou__ I don't know . I know there are advantages to joining , but I'm not much into group stuff . __eou__ The guys I've talked to say that the activities that go on in a frat house can be a little distracting depending on the group . __eou__ I think I'm going to decline . I just prefer to do my own thing . __eou__ Were your parents involved in that kind of thing at all when they went to school ? __eou__ My dad was , but not my mom . __eou__
May , could you bring this note to Professor Li for me today ? __eou__ Sure , no problem . Asking for leave again ? You have been absent from class five times this semester . __eou__ I know . But attending Miss Li's class is just waste of time . No more than one third of her students will go to her class . __eou__ I agree that Miss Li doesn't teach so well . Most students either sleep or do other things in her class . __eou__ Yeah , my boyfriend plays the video game every time in class with me . Or I chat with my friends through text messages . __eou__ Fortunately her class is just an elective course , not as important as compulsory courses . __eou__ Right , so we must spare some time to attend selective courses . __eou__ But isn't it too impolite to be absent ? __eou__ What can I do ? I have things to do in Students ' Government . __eou__ Oh , I thought you just gave an excuse on this note . __eou__ Sometimes I will try various excuses . But this is my last time asking for leave . Or I will have a bad record . __eou__ Yeah , besides , your credit will be deducted . That is kind of serious . __eou__ I have been absented from many classes this semester just because of my work in the Students ' Government . __eou__ You can't write with one hand and draw with the other . __eou__ I am thinking about quitting my job in the student government . But before that , I must do my job . Bye . Don't forget about that note . __eou__ You can count on me . __eou__
David , recently I established a travelling forum , and now I want to make a plan to hold the first activity . Where can we go for this time ? __eou__ How many members are there in your forum ? __eou__ a dozen . __eou__ I think we can visit West Lake . The landscapes are attractive . It is said that just as there is paradise in heaven , there are Su Thou and Hang Thou on earth . __eou__ It's surely worth going to . There are ten famous spots there . __eou__ What can we do next after locating the place ? __eou__ Inform my members to prepare for the travelling . And then we can discuss about the travelling costs . __eou__
Could you tell me something about the Mid-Autumn Festival ? I find it also very interesting . __eou__ OK . It falls on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month . It is said that there is a beautiful goddess Chang'E on the moon who had eaten some sort of elixir and had to depart her husband . She is always expecting to see her husband again . So , later we have the traditional idea that when there is the full moon , it is time for the family members to come together . __eou__ So , I understand why people eat moon cakes on that day . __eou__ You are right . In China , ' round ' is an auspicious word . The moon cakes are in round shape . __eou__ Is it official ? __eou__ It was not in the past . But from 2008 , we can enjoy a three-day holiday for this festival . __eou__
Do you still see the people we went to school with ? __eou__ I did for a while , I suppose , until I left university , but after that not really . __eou__ Yeah , I've lost touch with most people as well , but I still see Rose occasionally . __eou__ Oh yes , how's she getting on ? __eou__ OK , I suppose , but she's had a rough time in the last few years , She got divorced . __eou__ What , from Peter ? __eou__ Oh , of course . __eou__
Good morning , Mr . Green . Please have a seat . I received your resume last Monday and I would like to say I ’ m very impressed . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ May I asked why you are interested in working for us ? __eou__ Your company has an impressive reputation . My uncle worked for your company for many years . __eou__ Oh , did he ? __eou__ Yes , but he retired 5 years ago . __eou__ Would you mind telling me a little bit about your present job ? __eou__ I ’ m a senior broker in a large company . I deal with clients on a daily basis , handling all aspects of their accounts personally . __eou__ Do you think you are the right candidate for this position ? __eou__ Yes , I do think I am the right candidate for this position . __eou__ Why do you think you ’ re the right candidate for this position ? __eou__ Well , I have a lot of experience in this area . I have all the qualifications you need . I enjoy working with people . In my current job , I ’ m in charge of a team of eight people . __eou__ Well , you might be the person we ’ Ve been looking for . Do you have any questions ? __eou__ Yes , if I were hired , when would you like me to start ? __eou__ At the end of this month . __eou__ And how many accounts would I handle ? __eou__ You ’ ll be supervising six brokers who manage a combined total of 310 accounts . __eou__ What kind of benefit package do you offer ? __eou__ Two weeks of paid vacation in your first year of employment . You ’ re also eligible for medical and dental insurance . And we offer a generous retirement pension plan after 10 years of service . Do you have any other questions ? __eou__ No , not at the moment . __eou__ Well , I ’ ll have to discuss your application with my colleagues , and we ’ ll get back to you early next week . __eou__ Thanks . It was very nice to meet you . __eou__ It was nice to meet you , too . And thanks for coming in today . __eou__
My aunt told me one of her secrets--cellophane tape . __eou__ I just got it at the special health store . It's for my flabby arms . __eou__ Let me know how it works . __eou__ I have to say , I have had enough of this roller coaster . __eou__ I know what you mean . I'm like a yo-yo . __eou__ Last week I was down to 60 kilos . This week I had one donut more . Now I'm up to 62 kilos . __eou__
The tea smells good . What tea is it ? __eou__ It's a special green tea named Longing Tea from Zhejiang province . __eou__ What's special about it except its pleasant smell ? __eou__ You can see that it keeps the original color of the tea leaves very well . __eou__ They must have some special methods to do this during the process . __eou__ Probably . I love green tea . It's one of my daily necessities . __eou__ Then , do you have “ tea time ” every day ? I mean , do you drink tea at a settled time ? __eou__ Not really . But I really love to have after-meal tea . __eou__ What's the advantage about tea ? __eou__ There are a lot of them . In hot or warm days , tea helps to dispel the heat and brings on an instant cool with a feeling of relaxation . Moreover , the tea leaves contain a number of chemicals which are good for people's health . __eou__ Does that mean the stronger the better ? __eou__ No . Constant drinking of over-strong tea would do harm to people's health . So don't make your tea too strong . __eou__ Got it . What's the proper time for tea ? __eou__ It's fine for most time of the day . But don't have tea before bedtime . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ It will give rise to occasional insomnia . OK , let's enjoy the tea before it gets cold . __eou__
Hey there Chris , what are you up to ? __eou__ I'm just poring over some brochures about various car models . __eou__ Oh , so you're thinking about buying a new car ? __eou__ Yeah , it looks that way . My wife has been bugging me about it . I thought we could probably survive without one , but with a baby on the way , maybe it is time to get a car . __eou__ So this would be your first automobile ? __eou__ That's right . For quite a few years , I rode a bicycle to work . Then I got a motorbike . __eou__ Yeah , I think I can understand your wife's position . Asking her to ride on a motorcycle when she's pregnant is a tall order . __eou__ Oh ... I don't let her ride with me . It's just too dangerous . She takes the bus to work , but it is sometimes difficult to get a seat and it's crowded and hot . __eou__ So it's time to buy your very first car ! Wow , that's exciting ! __eou__ Yes , but it's also a pretty big financial responsibility . __eou__ Yeah . I still remember my first car . It was an old clunker that my dad gave me when I turned 17 . I drove it around for a couple of years until I scraped together enough money to buy a better secondhand car . __eou__ I'm having a hard time deciding which model is best for us . __eou__ Yeah , it is a tough call . Each one has its pros and cons . Are you looking for a sedan ? __eou__ Yes , I'd like a Jeep , but my wife says we have to get a comfortable sedan for long drives home to see her relatives . __eou__ I'd advise you to listen to your wife . She will be sitting in the back taking care of the kids so whatever she prefers is probably the best choice . __eou__
Johnny , I want to thank you . __eou__ What do you mean , Mom ? For breaking your best china ? __eou__ Oh , Johnny , that stuff was dollar store junk . No , I want to thank you for keeping Grandma busy . __eou__ Well , it's more like she kept me busy ... __eou__ I know , and normally she's trying to tell me how to clean my house . So , thank you . __eou__ Am I back in your good books ? __eou__ Not only that , but I'm going to buy you that video game after all ! __eou__
Hey , Brad . How was your day ? __eou__ Pretty good . Where are you going ? __eou__ I'm going home . __eou__ Wait . We have to return to our homeroom and wait to be dismissed . __eou__ Is that right ? __eou__ Our homeroom teacher has to take attendance again to make sure that we're all here . __eou__ So he takes attendance once in the morning and once in the afternoon . __eou__ Yeah . I'm going to my locker to get my jacket . Catch you later . __eou__
Hey , Jordan , is that you ? Long time no see ! __eou__ Oh , hey , no kidding ! I haven't seen you since orientation three months ago ! So how've you been ? Settling into college life OK ? __eou__ Yeah , I think so ! I pledged Phi Iota Alpha , so I'm living at the frat house now . __eou__ Oh , so you're a frat boy now , huh ? __eou__ Yeah , yeah , I know , it's totally cliche , but really , I think it's been a good decision . I've got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys . What about you ? What have you been up to ? __eou__ Not much . I'm still living at home and commuting to school . I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about . It just wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped . The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count . __eou__ That sounds smart ... but kind of boring . __eou__ Yeah , it is , a little bit . I joined the Great Outdoors Club , though , which has been a lot of fun . We've gone on two camping trips already , and I've made some good friends . __eou__ That's cool . Hey , so have you decided on your major yet ? __eou__ Definitely pre-med . What about you ? __eou__ I still have no clue ... but we don't have to declare a major till our sophomore year , so I've got time ! Oops , I'm late for class . Gotta run ! __eou__ OK , take care ! Hey , nice running into you ! __eou__ Yeah , you too ! __eou__
Morning . __eou__ Hi there Mr . Anderson ! How are you on this fine morning ? __eou__ Fine , thank you . __eou__ It sure is cold this morning , isn ’ t it ? I barely even get out of bed ! __eou__ Yeah . It ’ s pretty cold , alright . __eou__ Did you catch the news this morning ? I heard that there was a fire on Byron Street . __eou__ No , I didn ’ t hear about that . __eou__ Did you happen to watch the football game last night ? The Patriots scored in the last minute ! __eou__ No , I don ’ t like football . __eou__ Oh . . . By the way , I saw you with your daughter at the office Christmas party . She is really beautiful ! __eou__ She ’ s my wife ! Oh , here ’ s my floor ! Nice talking to you . Goodbye . __eou__ Sir this is the 56th floor ! We are on the 70th ! __eou__ That ’ s okay , I ’ ll take the stairs ! __eou__
You want to go to the movies tonight ? __eou__ Sure ! What ' s playing ? __eou__ The new Twilight movie ! __eou__ Twilight ? As in the vampire movies ? No way , I am watching that , but I don ' t understand why everyone is so excited about these films about vampires . It doesn ' t make sense . __eou__ Of course it does . It ' s like a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet . You can see a couple who are in love but can ' t be together because they are so different . And in the fact that immortality and super human strengthen this really sexy and there you have it ! Plus the cast is hip , young people that make the movie even more enticing . __eou__ I don ' t buy into that . I think it ' s just a fad . Pretty soon this will pass and everyone will be into wear-wolves or zombies ! __eou__
OK , Nick . Here's the question , What movie and its sequel both won an Oscar for Best Picture ? __eou__ The Godfather and The Godfather II , of course . They were both directed by Francis Ford Coppola . __eou__ Whew ! I'm impressed ! You really know your stuff ! __eou__ Only about old movies , really ... __eou__
OK . I'll take your bet , as long as the winner gets to pick the movie . What about you , Nick ? __eou__ Sure . Do you want to go first , Sally ? __eou__ Why not ! I rolled a five . The category is Best Pictures . __eou__ OK , here's your question What movie won the 1996 Oscar for Best Picture ? __eou__ I know that , it's The English Patient . It was one of the only good American movies of the 90s . __eou__ Well , along with Jurassic Park ! Nice going , you got the right answer . __eou__
Shall I punch out for you , Ross ? I am leaving now . __eou__ No , thanks . I have got to work overtime . __eou__ But today is Friday . You are not going to work overtime on Friday evening , are you ? __eou__ Well , I am . I'll have to finish this report for next Monday's meeting . Is Tom coming to pick you up ? __eou__ No . We ’ ll meet at my house . He invited my family to spend the weekend with his family at their villa . __eou__ That's nice . Where is his villa ? __eou__ It's not his villa , but his father's . I think it's somewhere in Florida . I am not sure myself . __eou__ Sometimes I envy you a lot . Tom is a good guy . __eou__ Come on . You just haven ’ t met the right person and I think that you work too much . You should learn how to entertain yourself and enjoy life . __eou__ I know , but I am a work maniac . __eou__ Well , suit yourself . I've got to run now . __eou__ Have a nice weekend . __eou__ You too . Oh , I forgot to tell you one thing . A girl called this afternoon . She said she was your ex-girlfriend . She wanted you to call her back . __eou__ Did she mention anything else ? __eou__ No , nothing else . See you Monday . __eou__ See you . __eou__
Have you had any experience with sales work ? __eou__ Yes , I have . In fact , I had worked for a foreign trade company for nearly two years , where I established business ties with several firms . __eou__ What exactly did you do at that company ? __eou__ Visit customers , dispatch consignments and things like that . __eou__ Did you like your work ? __eou__ Yes , I did . __eou__ But when and why did you leave the company ? __eou__ I left it two months ago . I didn't think I could learn much there , and there were not many opportunities for self-development . __eou__ I see . Why did you choose our company ? __eou__ I've been informed that there are many opportunities to develop myself in your company . Besides , I grew up in a city in the Northeast . I have lots of acquaintances in the region , which might help to push sales . __eou__
Hi , Zina . I had a feeling you'd be stopping by . __eou__ Then you've heard from Vital ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Look , Vince . I didn't mean to step on your toes , but we need to be decisive . __eou__ I know it . WebTracker is playing for keeps . They'll go for our jugular if we give them the chance . __eou__ This is awkward , I know . I know you're upset . But in two weeks you'll be thanking me . __eou__ Maybe . Maybe I will . __eou__
Do you have wool socks ? __eou__ Yes . We have socks made of various materials . These socks are of imported wool . __eou__ Can you guarantee the quality ? __eou__ Yes , absolutely . __eou__ Where are the panty-hose ? __eou__ Here . We have black , white and transparent panty-hose here . __eou__
What can I do for you ? __eou__ I want to get my car washed . __eou__ Would you like regular car wash package ? __eou__ I don't know what you mean . __eou__ Well , we will wash the exterior form top to bottom . We use a special shampoo , which gives the body that extra shine . __eou__ Do you wash windows ? __eou__ Of course . We wash the windows inside and out . __eou__ What about the interior ? __eou__ We use a vacuum cleaner that removes all the dirt , and we throw away all of the trash that we can find . __eou__ Sounds good , regular car wash package will be OK . __eou__ OK . I see . __eou__
Yeah , but you guys don't stay with the same classmates all day , right ? __eou__ Right . The people in your math class might not be the people you have science with . __eou__ So , you sent out invitations to your whole graduating class ? __eou__ Yep . And the date is set for homecoming night . __eou__ I thought homecoming was a high school dance . __eou__ It's a football game the school team plays at home . The dance and reunions are usually that night , too . __eou__
