These pavilions were used for gathering and leisure time . These five peaks also draw the approximate historical axis of central Beijing . __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ According to the dictates of Eng Shut , it is favorable to site a residence to the south of a nearby hill . When the capital was moved to Beijing , no hill existed at this location , so one was constructed . It is called " Coal Hill " . The last emper-or of Ming Dynasty , Chongzhen , committed suicide by hanging himself here in 1644 . __eou__ Tragedy . __eou__ Jingshan Park is especially a popular place for old people socializing and gathering .

A contract might be formal or informal , oral or written . An implemented contract is one which has been fully executed by both sides ; an executive contract is one which is going to be performed . They are enforceable by laws and any party who defaults the contract may be sued and forced to make compensation . __eou__ What are the purposes of contract ? __eou__ In an ordinary contract , the objective of a contract might be relatively simple , indicating the description of commodity , price , quantity , terms of payment and etc . __eou__ When we draft a contract , which points should we pay special attention to ? __eou__ Well .

And there is an automatic feeder which takes them to the conveyor belt at the start of the production line . __eou__ What about the smaller components ? __eou__ They're transported to the workstations on automated vehicles - robot trucks - which run on guide rails around the factory . __eou__

Today , we have invited a special guest , Prof . Yang . He will give us some advice on the legal aspects of international business . Your international legal advice is important to our business well being . Please give us some counsels on such issues as which laws govern the contract , what recourse is available for default or breach of contract by our clients or what to do if a dispute arises . __eou__ The significance of understanding the nuance and distinctions of foreign customs and business practices are a continual challenge for global entrepreneurs and trader . Despite many countries accession to TO membership , trade and investment frictions are still predominant among existing membership . However , these frictions will be better managed under the TO trade rules and the organization's dispute settlement mechanism . __eou__ In spite of this , international business contracts and arrangement must be precise , specific and all-inclusive to lessen misunderstanding , misconceptions and disagreements to the minimum 。 __eou__ Problem and disputes occur mainly due to difference in the laws of countries involved . For this very reason , it is imperative to establish from the outset which law governs when disputes arise . The most fundamental principle of all international contracts is the applicable laws and regulations . Make sure that the arbitration clause in your business contract be all-inclusive . __eou__ How can we protect our patents and trade market abroad ? __eou__ Yes , it will be your utmost interest to protect your intellectual property such as your innovations , idea , designs and copyrights in your target country . __eou__ As you know , our main focus is to penetrate the markets of countries in Asia . What is the current legal framework in the countries ? __eou__ The lack of regulatory transparency was a problem and still is to some extent . However , the countries are moving forward to deepen their reforms , new changes will involve the establisher of legal structures to sustain high levels of foreign as well a domestic private investments . This will surely strengthen the law and regulations in the countries , especially , areas related to trade issues . __eou__ Several years ago , the countries and China singed memorandums of understanding , pursuant to which the countries will improve their laws government intellectual property rights protection over the following two to three years . __eou__ Precisely , the actions the countries have committed to take are consistent with TO agreement . __eou__

So are you near-sighted or far-sighted ? __eou__ Near sighted . __eou__
Are you watching another news report about the war ? __eou__ Yes . The two sides declared a short ceasefire but it broke down earlier today . Several military target were destroyed by bombing . Many civilians were among the dead and wounded . __eou__ How did this war start ? __eou__ Bout side claim a small area of territory . Both sides tried to build border fences and began attacking each other . __eou__ Politicians from both sides sound increasingly belligerent . Neither side wants to compromise . __eou__ Relief agencies report that many civilians are in desperate need of food and shelter . Several European countries have agreed to send aid , but are afraid that their planes will be shot down . __eou__ What do you think will happen ? __eou__ Both countries are very poor . Soon they will run out of money to finance the war . Then , perhaps , they will negotiate . __eou__ It would be much simpler and cheaper if they negotiated first . __eou__
Look , there is traffic accident over there . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ The old man is knocked down by the bicycle . __eou__

The domestic market accounts for about 40 percent of our total sales . __eou__
What separates your product from the competition ? __eou__ Our product features inventory tracking software , which continuously updates and tracks your inventory on a real-time basis . __eou__ Is the software user-friendly ? __eou__ Yes it is very easy to use and each system installation comes with a 3 - day employee training seminar . __eou__ Is this training part of the package or will it cost extra ? __eou__ Our quoted price includes the software system , installation , 3 day training seminar and ongoing troubleshooting.There are no hidden costs . __eou__

Paul sends you his regards . __eou__ How nice of him ! __eou__
Why is little Billy crying ? __eou__ He got a scolding . __eou__
Ping-pong must be the top-ranking popular sport in China . It seems to me in every school , factory , army unit , or residential area , men and women , young and old , are swinging paddles . __eou__ You got it ! In a sense , it has become a byword for Chinese sport . __eou__ What do you think might be the source of its popularity ? __eou__ I think its critical advantage lies in its low cost . All you need is a racket , a table and a light celluloid ball . Tables are usually available in public recreation areas , like finest rooms , and outdoor playgrounds ... __eou__ And sometimes a substitute table can be made out of a few desks . __eou__ Put it there ! In senior high schools , we used to play on desks in the classroom , when no vacant tables were available . Likewise , the racket may take a variety of forms , too.Anything that resembles a racket , from a plank to cardboard or even a hardcover book , may be used as a racket . __eou__ Haha , these are very good inventions . All these speak the public's fondness for the sport __eou__ Yeah , the sport is affordable and accessible to every Tom , Dick and Jane in this developing country . No wonder even the state leaders are known to be keen on it . __eou__ I know President Hu Into likes playing ping-pong . __eou__ Actually , he excels in it . Chairman Mao , too , encouraged the whole nation to play ping-pong as a part of the nationwide body building campaign . __eou__ I see . There was also the famous ping pong diplomacy , wasn't there ? __eou__
I saw on TV that there is an entertainment item , bungee in Beijing Longtanhu Park . Except that the height is not exiting enough . __eou__ You say how high can be exciting ? __eou__ The highest bungee spot in the world is located in Mount Kikicama , South Africa , which is 216 meters high . A cable car in a scenic spot in Switzerland is 160 meters high . __eou__ I know that Frenchmen installed the Bungee cord between two tall buildings . __eou__ It is said that Bungee was originally a grown-up ceremony of the indigenous people of New Guinea . People stood on branches of the tree , which was over 30 meters high . Their feet were fastened with canes and they jumped off from where they stood . When they almost reached the ground , they suddenly stopped to prove their bravery and express that they were able to endure the hardships of life independently . __eou__ Luckily there is no such kind of ' grown-up ceremony ' any more . __eou__
She is kind of player who never hides how she's feeling . Once look at her and you know if she's winning or losing . __eou__ She wears her heart on her sleeve . __eou__

In foreign trade , exporters have to adjust their product in a timely manner . __eou__ How to adjust ? __eou__ Exporters must ensure that their product satisfies customers ' needs , wants and likes . __eou__ Ah , some products are successful at home , but not be popular overseas . __eou__ That's because the fashion , taste and social customs and so on vary considerably . __eou__ Yes , sometimes the differences are great . __eou__ Well , we should be in accordance with national conditions and adjust the product . __eou__ We have to ensure that the product should be attractive to guarantee sales . __eou__
I often see some ' new age people ' show off their various skills to handle a skateboard , which makes me wonder in awe . __eou__ Annie , you also know the ' new age people ' . I think these people must have undergone much sufferings of flesh in order to ride skillfully . __eou__ Although it is easy to ride , the condition of the road surface should also be paid attention to , such as places being put together and full of gullies . If the condition permits , it is better to be equipped with helmet , eye shades , ankle shield , knee shield and elbow shield . __eou__ The skateboard does not pollute the air , either . It can be used as a tool to ride instead of walk . __eou__
Those guys work at the same company and go to the same bars . They do everything together . __eou__ Birds of a feather flock together . __eou__
Most people in Montreal speak French . __eou__ Are there any people who speak English ? __eou__ Only less than 20 percent of the citizens speak English . __eou__
We've managed to reduce our energy consumption in our factory by about 15 per cent in the last two years . __eou__ That's excellent . How have you managed that ? __eou__ Mainly because we've invested in a heat recovery system . __eou__ What does that mean exactly ? __eou__ Well , we use the exhaust gases from our printing presses to provide energy to heat our dryers . __eou__ What other sources of energy do you use ? __eou__ We don't use any fossil fuels . Most of our power comes from hydro-electric plants . We're hoping to use even more energy from alternative sources in the future - perhaps even wind power . __eou__

When will the ceremony begin ? __eou__ The ceremony will begin at 9 0 ' clock . After the ceremony , there's a reception . By the way , do you know why they have chosen September 9th for their wedding ceremony ? __eou__ No idea . __eou__ As in English , Chinese also has some lucky numbers . The number 9 stands for perpetuity in Chinese . __eou__
Did anyone call ? __eou__ Just Mr . White . __eou__ What did he want ? __eou__ He wouldn't say over the phone . __eou__

You're my hero . __eou__ Aw , shucks , ma'am . __eou__
I really dislike reading academic books . __eou__ That may be so , but reading them is an important way to expand your knowledge . __eou__

You say your products are aimed at the green consumer . In what ways are they environmentally-friendly ? __eou__ We produce household cleaning products - detergents and so on . They are all phosphate-free , which minimises damage to the environment . __eou__ What about the packaging ? __eou__ We try to use as little packaging as possible . Also , all our bottles are made of recyclable plastic and we use recycled fibre in our boxes . That's what our customers want . __eou__
Did you watch the Premiership last night ? __eou__ Yes , I watched United play Chelsea . What a fierce battle ! allay were engaged in intensive pressing and tackling in midfield . Well , it was not like a normal English League match . __eou__ No , it wasn't . Rather , it looked like a Bundesliga match , where physical contact is so frequent . English League teams are apt to pass the midfield quickly with long passes . It seems to me English soccer players are very gentlemanly . As Diego Maradona spoke teasingly , they often knew only chasing hard after the ball , but forgot to steal it . __eou__ Haha . That's probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common , and offsides more frequent in English League matches than those on the Continent . And the ball is often kept flying overhead , drawing beautiful curves in the sky . Such games are quite pleasing to the eye . __eou__ Which team do you back then ? __eou__ I'm a firm United supporter . I like their playing style . The Reds always have several excellent wing-backs , Like Riggs , Peckham and Gary Neville . They often make wonderful crosses when they assist in attacking . __eou__ But the Reds keep a weak midfield . I think Juventas of Italian Series A have always maintained a very formidable midfield . It is the main source of its strength . __eou__
How was your self-help trip ? __eou__ Excellent . As soon as we landed , we boarded a bus to Disneyland . I love Mickey Mouse . Janet and I spent the entire first day going on all of the rides . __eou__ Didn't you feel any jet lag from the change in time zones ? __eou__ I felt fine . I must have been too excited to notice . __eou__ I've never been to Disneyland . I went to Universal Studios when I was fifteen . My parents took my brother Franco and I to Los Angeles and San Francisco.Wish you and Janet love each other more . __eou__
Last night I looked for my Indian classmate Barbara . I found her sitting with her legs crossed and quietly practicing . __eou__ Needless to say , it must be Indian Yoga . __eou__ Mary , you say something about it . __eou__ Tracing back , Yoga has a very long history . It was originated before India had approved Yoga and these documents were arranged and written according to the contents passed by mouth to mouth . In other words , Yoga is passed down from ancient times , which cannot be recalled . __eou__
I've been learning to play go recently . It's an amazing game ! __eou__ Weigh ? It must be a greatest Chinese invention . I've tried hard to learn it . Its rules can't be any simpler , but I've never won a game of Go . Well , it's all Greek to me ! __eou__ At least you have obtained a very basic understanding of the game , haven't you ? I think it is perfect for boosting intelligence , cultivating personality and flexible learning . Every intellectual wishing to gain any insight into Chinese culture should learn to play Go . __eou__ I heard it is included in the four major arts of China , is it ? __eou__ Sure . It was considered desirable that a well-educated ancient Chinese scholar could be well versed in zither , weigh , calligraphy and painting . I think weigh is the most fantastic of them . It embodies ancient Chinese wisdom and cultural profoundness . __eou__ I know it is quite different from Western chess . __eou__ Yes . Playing chess is a very aggressive experience . All the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . Whenever I start a chess game , I can't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill . __eou__ But isn't it the same with wiki ? __eou__ Certainly not . The object of weigh is to surround a larger area than the opponent . In other words , each side is struggling for a greater living space by mapping out a territory on the board . Hence , chess aims to kill , while weigh is most concerned with howso survive . __eou__
Wow . Look how polite your son has become . __eou__ Yes . We had a big talk with him , and he has really turned over a new leaf . __eou__
What kind of insurance could the company provide for its employees ? __eou__ All staff can enjoy the health insurance program . __eou__ What if an employee was injured due to work-related job ? __eou__ Employees are covered by worker's compensation insurance . __eou__

Which team won ? __eou__ The Spur . __eou__ What was the score ? __eou__ They managed a 99:80 victory . __eou__
Nowadays , ships and boats are no longer so important in transportation as they used to be . __eou__ True . With the extension of railways and highways , and the improvement of safety and capacity of airplanes , ships and boats have been giving place to trains , planes and automobiles . __eou__ I read in the newspapers that the passenger liners from Shanghai to Ningpo and Dalian have been out of business ; and the liners up and down the Yangtze River have been reduced by 70 % . __eou__ The pace of life of people is now getting faster and faster , so the speed of ships and boats seems to be so slow . I think it may be the reason why people don't like to travel by boat . __eou__ But the most of the transoceanic cargo transportation is still carried by boat . __eou__
Are you familiar with American-styled accounting ? __eou__ I am afraid not . I haven't worked in an American company so far . __eou__ What are the most fundamental concepts underlying the accounting process ? __eou__ The first is accounting entity , and the second is going concern . The third is measuring unit . The fourth is accounting period , and the fifth is objectivity . __eou__
It's amazing to me how international business has become . Take my store for example . On any given day , you will find imported items from more than 20 different countries on our shelves . __eou__ How many different varieties of products do you import from China ? __eou__ China provides the bulk of our product inventory , for sure . We import more than 40 different items from China . Most of the imports that come out of China are low-grade plastics or toys . Japan produces many electronic exports , Germany produces excellent mechanical exports . __eou__ Do you import any food items ? __eou__ Generally speaking , food items are difficult to import . Food with the short shelf life is liable to spoil in the time it takes to ship from one place to another . The only food items we import are specialty canned or preserved foods . The shelf life is longer for these products . __eou__
What did you exactly do there ? __eou__ I was responsible for helping patients restore their organic functions , training them in speech and organism , carrying our massage and physiotherapy , taking care of patients ' nutrition and diet . __eou__ What do you think are the qualifications for being a doctor ? __eou__ They are sense of post , mentality quality , first aid ability , emergency adjustment , and law consciousness . __eou__
If you go out recently you will find some people riding scooters in high streets and back lanes . __eou__ Yes . The German engineer would never dreamed that the hand - supported scooter he invented several years ago to solve his traffic problems would become so fashionable in the Occident within a few years and even spread to Japan and China . __eou__ Looking at the ' five sense organs ' of a scooter , it can be said as delicate and agile . To pull the T-shaped pole and make it vertical with the flat board and then pull it vertically , adjust its height suitable to you and you may use it . __eou__ Small and exquisite in size , easy to operate , foldable and easy to carry are its charms . __eou__ Your two hands hold the pole , stand on the board , the other foot steps back against the ground and controls well the balance of the body , then you can ride in the air . It has a feeling of surfing . You need not let other people teach you . Your fear will disappear quickly . __eou__
May , look at this mess ! You threw waste everywhere . __eou__ It ’ s not my fault . Daniel always sends things flying . __eou__
How about this opera given by the famous musician ? __eou__ Fair to middling . A little hard to appreciate . __eou__
The buildings are really magnificent . __eou__ Yes , millions of travelers come here every year for the view of the buildings . __eou__ The journey is worth while . Where are we going after this ? __eou__ We will visit the Statue of Liberty as scheduled . __eou__
Why should I buy this MD player ? __eou__ Well , it has a lithium battery that lasts for 24 hours and it has a 160 second anti-skip mode for when you're playing sports . __eou__ What else ? __eou__ Using MP3 mode , you can download about 10 hours of music from either your CD player , or your computer's hard disk onto one mini-disk . __eou__ But how's the sound quality ? __eou__ You can choose from several play modes , or you can use the full-spectrum equalization , 3 D mode and Mega Bass features . We rec-ommend using it with the studio monitor headphones . __eou__ Is that it ? __eou__ It's ultra-compact , it has a brushed , titanium metal body and a rubber shock-proof , weather-proof case with a belt clip . __eou__
Tom has grown six inches within a year . __eou__ He has reached puberty . His mind and body both will change a lot . __eou__ Yeah , do you see his Adam's apple ? It becomes bigger . __eou__ Time is flying . I still remember everything when he was a child . __eou__
They are professors and government officials . __eou__ Where are they from ? __eou__ Most of them are from America and Europe . __eou__ What are they doing in Beijing ? __eou__ They are attending an international conference here . __eou__ Which hotel are they staying at ? __eou__ They are staying at the Hilton Hotel . __eou__
You didn't tell me she was married ! __eou__ I tried . You were preoccupied . __eou__ I got carried away . I made such a fool of myself . They were both laughing at me ! __eou__ You got drunk , and you were hilarious . Lighten up . __eou__ That guy was definitely a Don . __eou__ So now you can say you had a mafia experience . Ha-ha . __eou__ Yeah . If I leave Little Italy alive ... __eou__ Are you kidding ? Don had fun scaring you . He'd probably buy you dinner if we go back . __eou__
No . 164 in lane 3 achieved 11 ' 16 in the 100 meter dash . Isn't that something ? __eou__ Yeah . He's the most experienced athlete in the field . __eou__ He won the first place ! __eou__ Good boy ! __eou__
People of different races are fit for quite different sports . For instance , Asians are especially good fattable tennis , badminton , diving and shooting . They seem to have been born with certain natural endowments in technical sports , in which flexibility , agility and quick reflexes are favorable . __eou__ And a typical example has been the Chinese athletes at the Beijing Olympics , right ? __eou__ Yes , in all these four sports . the Chinese Olympic dream teams led the way . They swept the floor against their opponents in table tennis and diving . __eou__ Then what are the Westerners fit for ? __eou__ I think they are in a better position in those sports that demand a high degree of intensity , speed and explosive force like swimming , field games , etc . __eou__ Where do you think the edge is for black athletes ? __eou__ It's common sense that African athletes always make a clean sweep in track events , middle or long distance races , relays , hurdles , barriers , and marathon . __eou__ I got you . Their competitive edge lies mainly in endurance and stamina . They are creatures from the savannah , and take to running like antelopes . __eou__
My accountant thinks she can save me lots of money on my taxes this year . __eou__ That sounds great ! __eou__
Is your lady beautiful ? Since I came here from the country , I've not seen her close . Tell me , is she beautiful ? __eou__ Thomas , if I could write with the beauty in her eyes , I was born to look in them and know myself . __eou__ And , her lips ? __eou__ Her lips ? The early morning rose would wither on the branch if it could feel envy . __eou__ And her voice like a lark's song ? __eou__ Deeper , softer , none of your twittering larks . I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupted her song . __eou__ Oh , she sings too ? __eou__ Constantly . Without doubt , and plays the lute . She has a natural ear . __eou__
Susan has got the cancer of stomach . __eou__ How terrible ! This is quite unexpected ! __eou__ Yesterday when I went to hospital to see her , you cannot imagine how greatly surprised when I saw her . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ Because of atomic cocktail and other medicines , all of them have the side effect . she has lost all her hair . __eou__

I like chess better than xiangqi . And you ? __eou__ For my part , xiangqi . Maybe it's because my girlfriend is Chinese . __eou__ I think chess is more reasonable . You see , each side has eight pawns , a larger number than that of the soldiers in xiangqi . A true battle should be like that . Soldiers should outnumber the commanders . __eou__ Quite right . And unlike the soldiers in xiangqi , the pawns in chess can promote once they reach the furthest rank . It is very agreeable to grant merits to people with good performance . __eou__ Correct ! Another contrast is the rules for the general and the king . It seems the general or marshal in xiangqi is much too incompetent . They are required to stay in the palace , waiting to be checked and fleeing for life under the cover of the guards . Look at the king in chess , he is much more capable . __eou__ Yeah , and though the king in chess doesn't have bodyguards , he has a queen who is the most powerful piece . I think this demonstrates the relatively higher social status of aristocratic women in medieval Europe than in China . __eou__ There's another distinctive contrast . Both board games use a total of 32 pieces , but xiangqi is played on a 9 - by - 9 board , bigger than the 8 - by - 8 board used in chess . __eou__ You mean , xiangqi pieces are allowed a larger space in which to move around ? __eou__ Sure . On a chessboard , fire is much more intensive . It has a smaller board , while those bigger pieces-chariots , horses and bishops-can cover longer distances . __eou__
Ms.Green , are the schools more or less similar everywhere throughout the United States , or do they differ in various sections ? __eou__ The system of public schools is fairly uniform everywhere throughout the United States . __eou__ Do most students in the United States attend private schools or public schools ? __eou__ Most public schools in the United States are very good , and the majority of students attend the public schools . __eou__ Which students go to private schools , then ? __eou__ Children needing special instruction . Children whose parents can afford to send them to private schools , and children whose parents want them to receive a religious education . __eou__ But are the public schools good everywhere ? __eou__ No , public schools can be very different . Even in the same city . __eou__ Dose it cost anything to attend the public schools ? Are there any restrictions as to who may and may not attend ? __eou__ The public schools in the United States are free to everyone and there is no cost to the student . In most states , even the textbooks are free . There are no restrictions as to color , race , or religion.Any student wishing to attend the public schools may do so . __eou__

S . ? __eou__ His life sucked . He was hoping a fighter jet would shoot him down . __eou__ Poor guy . __eou__

Which team do you think will emerge with the last laugh in this World Cup ? __eou__ I wish it could be Germany . But it seems they are not in a very good conditions . __eou__ No , they aren't . They had a hard time in the group stage and only sealed a sit in the eighth-finals with Wallack ' s header in the final three minutes . Just think , group A consists of Austria , China , and Saudi Arabia , all of which are minnows . __eou__ It seems they've been out of luck since the beginning of the event . Their shots hit the woodwork as many as six times . Oh . my goodness ! I'm afraid the team is under a spell . __eou__ Well , at least the Germans have demonstrated a very good ability to control the midfield . They recorded a total of 62 tackles in the match against Austria . And they to be endowed with perfect positional sense . I think that will give rise to scoring chances sooner or later . __eou__ I agree . Eeven though German attackers are not good at dribbling past opposing defenders , they breach the defensive line through quick movements to the right attacking positions and through accurate , well-timed passes . __eou__ That's why I still have very high hopes for the team . Now that the tournament has proceeded into the knock-out stage , the Germans will probably make it through to the finals . __eou__ Yes . They have a good reputation for their tenacity and discipline , especially in vital , decisive encounters . __eou__
Where do these flower vases come from ? __eou__ They are made a town nearby . The flower vases are made of porcelain and covered with tiny bamboo sticks . __eou__ Are they breakable ? __eou__ No . They are not only ornamental , but also useful . __eou__ No wonder it's so expensive . __eou__

Were they famous because of the ugliness ? __eou__ Though they were ugly , they had great virtue . __eou__ Then who were they ? __eou__ Mo Mu , Thong Lichen , Meng Gang and Ran Nv . They were well respected . __eou__ It seems that the inner beauty is also important . __eou__ Sometimes the inner beauty is more beautiful . __eou__
Janice , do you still remember how our filing system works ? __eou__ Yes , I have read the Filling Instruction carefully , since you showed me it last week . __eou__ Very good . What is the essence of filing , do you know ? __eou__ The essence of filing I remember is to bring together in a single folder or file all papers relating to a particular subject . And outgoing and incoming letters are kept in this file cabinet . __eou__ Yes , ' One customer--one file ' is essential . And remember to update them timely . __eou__ And each file should be named clearly , either in block capitals or in jet black typed capitals . __eou__ Correct . __eou__ A card index is very important in the filing system .

We replace the gaskets every month . __eou__ How do you decide how often these things need to be done ? __eou__ Well , from experience we can predict the lifespan of different components . We try to replace components before they fail or wear out . This prevents the equipment from breaking down . It also saves us a lot of trouble ! __eou__
Did you read the news that ' China's property prices rose at the fastest pace in 18 months in December , ending the year with rising fears of bubbles in the property market ' ? __eou__ No .

It says the hike was a result of purchase rush in the fourth quarter on expectations of tightening politics . __eou__ I think the government should make a serves of moves to cool the market . __eou__ Right . The climbing property prices has become a headache for Chinese residents . __eou__

The second , less harmful , comes from the so-called Van Allen Belts . __eou__

Because both groups are made up of mothers ... so as before , we can play up on maternal instincts , hygiene , safety , along those lines . But that being said , there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here . __eou__ Right , that makes sense . What's the average age ? __eou__ Demographics say an average age of 28.7 , educational background of university or post-grad , annual household income of 40-50 K a year . __eou__

We ’ Ve been over this a thousand times . The data is irrefutable ! Look , we ’ Ve done extensive research , built studies , and read the literature , and there is conclusive evidence to support my theory ! __eou__ Horowitz , I beg to differ .

Since China was open to the outside world , its trade forms have become much more flexible . One of these commonly used forms is co-production . Would you please do a bit explanation of it , Mr . Walker ? __eou__ Well , under this arrangement two parties cooperate to manufacture a product or a category of products , for example , machine tools for export . Each party produces and supplies a part of the components and parts ; one party is a Chinese enterprise , the other , an overseas firm . Most probably , the foreign counterpart contributes technology and equipment , and sometimes , parts and components , while the Chinese enterprises factory building , labor and other resources to the cooperative production . They join hands and fulfill orders together by an agreement or a contract . __eou__ I suppose that the assembling of these components and parts , particularly the marketing of the finished products should take place in China . __eou__ Not necessarily . It depends on the contract stipulations . They may be marketed in the foreign country where the other party is located , or even in a third country . __eou__ I think the principle of co-production is to expand export trade . It's a reciprocal business , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , you are right . Either party is not well-equipped to produce the final products single-handedly , but they can enter into an agreement . In such case , each side contributes different resources to make the manufacture of a certain product or a category of products possible . __eou__

And then-notice there are no children around ? __eou__ Yeah , what's up with that ? __eou__ The kids wait in the house while the grownups hide these . Hide away , Yi-jun ! __eou__
In spring , people are feeling refreshed . They take off their heavy winter clothes and walk with a straight back and light steps . They feel they are full of spirits and energy . __eou__ Women in particular . They are anxious to get rid of those thick and clumsy winter suits and put on their new fashionable spring dress . __eou__ Well , when summer comes , the weather is hot and the leaves turn darkgreen ; the sun is blazing and the air is threatening . No one would like to stay in the open air for long . __eou__ That's true . In summer , the first place people want to go is a spacious room with air-conditioning or a quiet river or swimming pool . __eou__ I myself like very much to listen to the singing of some of the insects , especially the singing of cicadas . __eou__ In autumn , almost all fruits are ripe and all crops are waiting to be harvested . __eou__ And you can hear singing and laughing everywhere ! People are happy in autumn because autumn brings them harvest and richness and prosperity ! __eou__ Well , winter is a season for relaxation , do you agree with me ? __eou__ Well , it's hard to say . For the fields and rivers , winter is a relaxing season , but for farmers , I think they might take a rest physically , but mentally they are still busy thinking , planning and calculating for the working of the next year . __eou__ Maybe you are right . __eou__
My son has really taken it out of me . He never keeps out of mischief . __eou__ After all , he is a baby . __eou__ Yeah . Anyway he is driving me mad . __eou__
My friend George has been to Switzerland twice . __eou__ Does he like that country ? __eou__ Yes , he likes the people and the quietness there . __eou__ Would you ask him to tell us more about the country ? __eou__
A Westerner said to his Chinese friend . “ Chinese people slurp when drinking soup . It ’ s disgusting . ” The Chinese friend replied , “ Westerners make a lot of noise licking their fingers when eating . It ’ s even worse . ” __eou__ Everyone has his own habits , but these habits are not very good . The noise often spoils other people ’ s appetite . __eou__ I attended a course on table manners while I was in the United States . Some of the things we learnt included how to place the napkin and utensils and how to pass the bread . Before each course , the teacher would ask if we wanted to learn the Continental European way or the American way . We always said “ American way . ” It ’ s amazing that everyone is so used to their own table manners . What is the Chinese way ? __eou__ The westerners use knives and forks to eat so it is complicated . The Chinese use a pair of chopsticks and eat out of the same plate . I assume it is less complicated , right ? __eou__ Not really . I did some research about Chinese table manners . The important rule is to remain silent while eating . Of course , this refers to family meals only . Not talking over meals is supposed to be good for the health . It is impolite if people do not talk to each other during a social party . The table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated . Each dish should be placed in the correct position . When fish is served , the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty . If it is in winter , the stomach should face the right-hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter . Each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table . The diners should sit close to the table so food won ’ t drop on their cloths . No noise should be made when chewing . No one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn ’ t like it . One should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise . All these table manners are very similar to Western habits . __eou__ It seems that people share the same basic sense of etiquette regardless of their background . Apart from the different tools used for eating we seem to follow the same principles . We do not let inappropriate manners spoil other people ’ s appetite.Westerners like to say , “ bon appetite ” before meals which is one way to suggest “ mind your table manners . ” Is there such an expression in Chinese ? __eou__ Yes . We say “ eat well and drink well . ” __eou__
Who's that ? __eou__ Saint Jude-he's the saint of lost causes . Like my cousin , Anna , who can't stop getting pregnant . She's a lost cause . __eou__ Is that your cousin in the back ? __eou__ Yep . She's always got a bun in the oven . She was pregnant before marriage-a real sin in the Catholic Church . __eou__ What about birth control pills ? Don't they work on Italians ? __eou__ Ha-ha . Birth control and abortion are four-letter words in my family . __eou__ And I heard that Italian men have very active libidos . __eou__
He thought he could take Jimmy in , but you know , Jimmy is no fool . __eou__ So ? __eou__ So Jimmy just took him in instead and it cost him an arm and a leg . __eou__ You mean finally Henry bought the broken car himself . __eou__ Exactly . Herry is almost broken now . __eou__
These things are always oooo boring . Heard any gossip ? Anybody making the big bucks ? __eou__ Rich struck it rich in advertising . And he and Cath got married and just had a child . __eou__ That's no news . Those two were high school sweethearts anyway . __eou__ Teresa Jones got a boob job . __eou__ Uh , I can see that . And Erica Falls has lost a lot of weight . __eou__ I've got something . You saw Taylor Smith ? Looks terrible , doesn't he ? I heard he ... __eou__
Did you hear what's going on downtown today ? All the orders from the factory are staging a demonstration in the streets . Not one of the two thousand employees showed up for work today , and they have gathered outside the city hall to demand better working conditions for all factory employees . __eou__ Wow , sounds chaotic ... two thousand people in the streets carrying picket signs and shouting slogans . What gave them the motivation to finally organize and call management on the substandard working conditions ? __eou__ I think they gained courage after the mayor's speech last week on equality and opportunity for all town citizens . Anyway , the sentiments have been brewing for quite some time . I mean , we all know the working conditions at the factory are quite horrendous . __eou__ So what kind of demands do they have ? What are they asking for specifically ? __eou__ They want raises and medical insurance , and I think they want to clean up the factory's safety hazards . That's probably the most important issue . __eou__
Did you watch TV last night , Rose ? __eou__ Yeah . I saw a science program . It was quite interesting . __eou__ What was it about ? __eou__ Mars . Scientists say there might be water on it . __eou__ If so , we may live there someday . __eou__ I hope so . Did you know the US successfully sent two robotic explorers to Mars last month ? __eou__ Sure . I heard about this on the TV . On January 3rd , 2004 , Explorer Spirit landed near the so-called Guser Crater . And three weeks later , Spirit's twin explorer , Opportunity , landed on Meridian Planum named by scientists . __eou__ Yes . Both have sent back pictures of the planet . And the latter did a better job . __eou__
Come back . You haven't paid yet . __eou__ May , just let him go . __eou__ But he took some newspaper away without paying . __eou__ I know . __eou__ Why ? You make me confused . __eou__ He lives nearby and he would just glance at the newspaper headlines , read the political sections and return them later . __eou__ Why does he have such a privilege ? __eou__ He used to be a hero during the war time and everyone respect him . __eou__ I see . Does he live by himself ? __eou__ Yes , he has no children and his wife passed away when he was in the battle . __eou__ He must be lonely ? __eou__ I bet . But he is always busy telling the children stories . __eou__ How respectable ! __eou__
The demographic reports are in ... From the looks of it , we're going to have to re-evaluate some of the content for our promotional events in different venues . __eou__ Why , what's the lowdown ? __eou__ According to the report , our Boston crowd is quite different make-up from our Chicago folks . Our Boston consumers are mostly from mid-level to upper-class income levels , university or postgraduates , married no children , white collar ... You know the kind . Chicago on the other hand is mostly mid to low income levels , single parent homes , blue collar ... I think we're talking about two totally different target groups . __eou__ I have no idea there was that great of deviation between the two venues ... To make our products sell , we have to take the target audience into account . __eou__ No kidding . We've got to come up with two completely different sales pitches to suit the needs of each groups . __eou__
Did you watch the old-fashioned wrestling game last night ? __eou__ Yes , of course . And I'm amazed the those karate and judo boys were so helpless before the wrestlers . __eou__ You bet . The wrestlers had got sound defences and they simply couldn't make it . __eou__
Excuse me . What should be included in my CV ? __eou__ Generally speaking , a CV or resume is made up of 6 parts , personal information , educational experience , practical experience , personal skills , self-evaluation and job intentions . __eou__ What kind of personal information ? __eou__ Including your name , sex , date of birth , height , phone number , and so on . __eou__
You've heard of Bruce Jenner , haven't you ? __eou__ He won the decathlon in the 1976 Olympics , right ? __eou__ I read that he trained so much that he used to dream about jumping hurdles . __eou__ I can think of better things to dream about ... __eou__ Sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat , with his legs pumping away . __eou__ That's crazy . __eou__
Good idea ! I've heard that the Expo is doing pretty well now , and ads are seen everywhere in the country on all means of media , newspapers , TV , street signs , etc . __eou__ Yeah , it's the last world-wide horti-cultural exposition in the century , and one of the grand festivities of cross-century significance held by the China's tourism industry . __eou__ what's interesting to see there ? __eou__ Oh , there's plenty . Flowers and plants from all over the world , of course . Besides , gardening techniques are demonstrated , modern facilities displayed , academic exchanges and seminars organized , and folk performances of different nations shown almost every day . __eou__ I visited the First International Flower Festival in the city last year , and was impressed with so many beautiful flowers ! __eou__ Oh , can't compare with the Kunming Expo at all ! The Kunming Expo covers an area of 218 hectares , and more than 9000 flower enterprises from over 100 countries and regions are invited to participate in the Expo . __eou__ It would be a rare occasion to be able to appreciate so many fine species of Chinese and foreign flowers fully blooming in one park ! __eou__ Far more than that , I dare to say ! Inland provinces and cities , Hong Kong and Macao , as well as many countries and regions in the world have an exhibition area of their own to display their unique flowers and plants . Each month there's a special day for a particular country or region , and folk performances are given . You will feel it a great pity if you missile Kunming Expo . __eou__
How about another beer ? __eou__ No , thanks . I've had more than enough.In fact , I must be running along . __eou__ Stay around for a while.The party is warming up . __eou__ I'm afraid I have to leave . I have to be up early tomorrow . __eou__
... The rings please . May this ring be blessed so he who gives it and she who wears it may abide in peace , and continue in love until life ’ s end . __eou__ With this ring I thee wed . Wear it as a symbol of our love and commitment . __eou__ Honey , that ’ s my pinkie . The ring goes on the ring finger ! __eou__ This one ? __eou__ That ’ s my index finger ! __eou__ Oh , right . This one , right ? __eou__ Umm ... that ’ s the thumb , Nick . __eou__ Okay , Okay , I got it ! This is the ring finger ! __eou__ That ’ s my middle finger , Nick . This is my ring finger ! __eou__
Have you always been on this site ? __eou__ No , we used to be on an industrial estate on the outskirts of York . __eou__ Why did you move ? __eou__ We needed larger premises so we moved to this greenfield site last year . It's nearer the motorway so it's better for transportation . __eou__
He has a long head , I bet he will do well in his business . __eou__ He does , he started five years ago and now ends up the richest among us . __eou__ When we were students , he was no good in any subject . __eou__ It seemed to be useless to study well when we were young if we examine his case . __eou__
Do you like shopping at flea markets ? __eou__ l love it . There is always something fascinating to discover . __eou__ The antiques market here in Paris is very famous . It's called Le marche aux puces de Saint-Ouen . __eou__ That's not very easy to say . __eou__ It's also known as Les Puces , which means ‘ The Fleas ' . __eou__ Can you find many bargains there ? __eou__ Well , it really depends . Because you are a tourist , it might be harder for you to get really good prices . __eou__
Some people pile on their agonise and try to seek other ’ s sympathy by telling them how miserable they are . __eou__ Yeah . They take the advantage of other people's hospitality and generosity . __eou__ I was fooled once . A lady told me she needed some money to keep the pot boiling . So I gave her some money and bailed her out of the situation . But later I learned that she had lied to me . __eou__ You are still wet behind the ears . You should have seen through her . __eou__ Nothing rang a bell . __eou__
Look , here're two coins named Kai Yuan Tong Bao — the sort of coin made in memory of the founding of a new dynasty . These two coins were made in different periods of the Tang Dynasty . __eou__ How can you tell the difference ? From what I see , they look almost the same . __eou__ The one made in the early Tang period is bigger and has more characters on it , while the one with smaller and elegant characters was made in late Tang period . Look carefully , and tell me if you see the difference now . __eou__ Yes , they are different ! But it's too professional . What I need is just being able to tell the real from the fake . Do you know any method we can use to tell a fake ancient coin ? __eou__ Various methods were used in history to produce fake coins . We usually send the coin to an authorized unit to have it tested by experts with special machines . We can judge it with naked eyes . __eou__ I see . By the way , China was more than once ruled by foreign tribes in history . Did they issue their own coins in China ? __eou__ Certainly , they did . Liao Coins and Song Coins , for example , coexisted in circulation during the Southern Song and Yuan period some 800 -1000 years ago . The Liao Coins look plain and bold in style , just like the characteristics of the Mongolian tribe . Let me look for one and show you . __eou__ If you happen to find one , please bargain with the owner for it . I'd like to have one . It's interesting to see the integration of the Han and Mongolian cultures on this small piece of metal . __eou__
Thank you all for coming to our monthly staff correlation meeting . Today we have a lot of new things to introduce to you all , there will be a lot of changes in company policy to accommodate better employee welfare . __eou__ Employee welfare ? What all does that include ? __eou__ In the past , our welfare program has consisted of benefits packages only , meaning partial health insurance coverage and retirement plan . But we hope to boost morale by increasing incentives and adding additional welfare considerations . __eou__ What kind of considerations are we talking about ? __eou__ It is proposed that from now on , employees will be given 10 paid sick days , in addition to their 2 week vacation periods . They will also be encouraged to maintain proper physical health with a company sponsored aerobics class on Friday nights . We have also consulted with the human resource department and have hired a new liaison between management and employees . Let ’ s all welcome Ms . Michelle Cain to our team as our company ’ s ombudsman . __eou__ Our company now has n ombudsman ? __eou__ Yes , that ’ s right . From now on , whenever you have a question or concern regarding anything that happens during the work day , Ms . Cain will be your advocate . If you believe there is anything inappropriate or unfair in the management practices , the ombudsman will be the first person you seek . Her job is to have your best interest at heart . __eou__
Could you tell me something about investment environment of your country ? __eou__ Our country is a free trade nation . She was mainly agriculture and rather a backward country and mow has developed into a modern highly industrialized state with an expanding economy . Parallel to this , her dependence upon foreign trade has increased . Increased output generates a greater need for raw materials , semi-finished products and capital goods . Thus . in many fields , our country is an important and growing market for exporters from other countries . But this doesn't mean that our country is an easy market , because of a liberal import policy and the high standard in our market is keen . __eou__ Well , what about price ? __eou__ The price factor can be a useful instrument for exporters when trying to place their products in industrialized countries . Of course , marketing goods abroad is not only a question of price . There are also other important factors such as design , quality of goods , terms of sale , transport and insurance . __eou__
Have you seen this news article ? Apparently an organization has made a list to name the new seven wonders of the world and people could vote for them online . __eou__ Wow , that's really interesting . So who won ? __eou__ Well , the Great Wall of China , the Taj Mahal in India . __eou__ I've been there ! It really is an amazing work of architecture and art . The entire complex is made of white marble and in the interior of the tomb , the walls are covered with gems and emeralds ! __eou__ Cool ! Also amongst the winners is Petra , in Jordan , Mach Pitch in Peru and the pyramid in Chichenitza in Mexico . __eou__ Wait a minute ! It also says that the Christ Re-deemer statue in Brazil and the Colosseum in Rome are wonders . I would love to go to Italy and see the Colosseum , stand in the middle like a gladiator ! __eou__ Well , let's see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the year . __eou__ Good idea ! __eou__
Is Tom here ? __eou__ Speaking . __eou__
Good morning , mom . __eou__ Good morning , sweetie . You finally got up . __eou__ I'm still sleepy . __eou__ Did you stay up late last night ? __eou__ No , I couldn't fall asleep last night . __eou__
Be careful.The floor is slippery . __eou__ Mom , there isn't any hot water __eou__ Turn on the shower . __eou__ It's getting cold . __eou__ Ok . I'll check the heater . Dry yourself with the towel first . __eou__
That restaurant has six parking spaces . __eou__ What are the odds of finding a parking space there ? __eou__ Almost zero . __eou__

Gosh , another stop.It seems the cars ahead of us have to stop every two minutes , It's no quicker than a bus . __eou__ That's true . During rush hours , taxis are just as quick as buses . __eou__ It was silly of me to have taken a taxi . __eou__ At least , it can free you from the crowd . By the way , do you come from China ? __eou__ No , from New Zealand , sir . I visited New Zealand and saw lots of overseas people there . __eou__ Wow , like America . It receives a great number of visitors every year . __eou__ The more the world becomes open , the more people become international ! __eou__
I've typed the report . __eou__ Well done . __eou__ And I've filed the letters . __eou__ Excellent job . __eou__ And I've checked the orders . __eou__ I'm very impressed . __eou__ And I've ordered the supplies . __eou__ Congratulations . You should be very proud of yourself . __eou__
Study hard , otherwise you'll fail . __eou__ Yes , Mum . __eou__ Don't render me lip-service , you'd better stay at home tonight . __eou__ But it's Sunday , isn't it ? __eou__
Mary didn't pass the final exam in physics . __eou__ She must be very sad . __eou__ Her parents scolded her severely and she's very depressed now . __eou__ At a time like this , what she needs is a pat on the back rather than a blame . __eou__
We have a class outing today . __eou__ Have fun . __eou__
How many courses do you have for this semester ? __eou__ Eight altogether . __eou__ How are they proportioned ? __eou__ Six are compulsory , two optional . __eou__
Our major is from a bigger city . __eou__ He ’ s doing fine . A new broom sweeps clean . __eou__ He brings with him some talented people from his former city . __eou__ I think we ’ ll benefit a lot . __eou__
Can you imagine a boat letting in the river ? __eou__ That would be terrible . __eou__ Sure thing . I have an experience like that . __eou__ Oh , how were you saved finally ? __eou__ I was in such a panic at that time . Fortunately another boat came along and I was saved from drowning . __eou__
Remember that writing contest I entered ? Well , I won first prize . __eou__ Great ! This calls for a celebration . __eou__

Jane , what do think about this dinner ? __eou__ Very good ! Chinese food rules ! I expect the next time . __eou__
Hurry up . Time is running out . __eou__ I see . I have run as fast as I can . __eou__
I love her so much , you know . I want to be alone . Please keep quiet . __eou__ I am just casting pearls before swine . __eou__
You can take this car into consideration . It works well and its price is reasonable . __eou__ I was not born yesterday . __eou__
Yesterday I had a deal with a vice manager . He acts like the point man . __eou__ I always meet people like him . __eou__
Guess what ? __eou__ What ? __eou__
Good morning . __eou__ Good morning . __eou__ What does the paper say ? __eou__ Nothing much — the same old stuff . A lot of bad news as usual . __eou__ Well , what ’ s the weather report ? __eou__ Sunny and mild today , cloudy and rainy tomorrow . __eou__ Did they find those bank robbers ? __eou__ Not yet . They were holding two men in Ohio , but they let them go . They weren ’ t the criminals after all . __eou__ What about the sports page ? What were the scores of last night ’ s games ? __eou__ Here ’ s the paper ; you can read them yourself . __eou__
How's John doing ? __eou__ He can barely make ends meet . __eou__

I've really enjoyed your party , Lisa . __eou__ Not at all , Sam . __eou__ I wish I could stay longer , but I must be going . __eou__
Do you know the highest mountain in the world ? __eou__ Yes . It is Everest , also called Zhumulangma in China . It is 8,844 . 43 meters above the sea level . __eou__ Wow ! That must be really awesome to stand on the top of the mountain to overlook the earth . __eou__ Actually , it is impossible because the mountain is covered with snow all year around . And is has heavy fog for most of the time . __eou__ Have people set foot on its peak ? __eou__ Yes , it has been conquered by many people in history . __eou__
Congratulations ! Mr . Stuart ! You won the city marathon . __eou__ Thank you . I am very excited . __eou__ We are all very proud of you . __eou__ I am very happy , too . It was a big game and I won . __eou__ I watched the race with my children . We saw you run to the finish line . We all screamed with excitement . __eou__ It was really an exciting moment . __eou__
Look at this , A Brief Introduction of Hollywood . __eou__ Hackneyed theme ! __eou__ What ? How much do you know Hollywood ? __eou__ Nearly everything . __eou__ You are full of boasts . I can examine you by question and answer . What is Hollywood ? Where is it ? What is the function of it ? __eou__ Too easy questions . Listen carefully . Hollywood is the movie capital of the world.It is located in southern California . Many films have been made there , and the kinds have changed often . __eou__ Not bad . What kind of film did it produce from the ready to mid 1930 ' s __eou__ Gangster movies . Movie-goers at that time could get a look at the people involved in crime and their violent activities by watching it . __eou__ Mm . What came after that ? __eou__ After all that violence , people needed to laugh , so from the mid-to-late l940 ' s , many detective movies about policemen who solved crimes were made . Then came musicals . __eou__ Pretty good . Please continue . __eou__ Right . By the mid - 50 ' s , this light-hearted genre was competing with films about more serious subjects . There was one kind that could be found throughout all of these years , and that was the , mm , the . . . __eou__ The western films about America's cowboys , Indians and early settlers . __eou__ Come on . __eou__ Since the early 1960 ' s , there are horror movies about people who encounter frightening , unnatural situations , and serious films such as documentarist about events that actually happened , and science fiction movies about possible friture and future worlds . Some people have also enjoyed watching psycho-dramas about the everyday problems that people have . __eou__ Any more ? __eou__ Of course , no list of film would be complete without animated movies . These are especially popular among children . __eou__
I hear you have just shown your hand first to Lin Ping . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ If I were in your position , I wouldn't give up an inch . __eou__ I regret to say I can't accept your suggestion . __eou__
What are your hobbies ? __eou__ Sports . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ Basketball and swimming . __eou__
I like small towns . __eou__ But many roads are very narrow . __eou__ Not always , and there're also few cars ! __eou__ Yes , because of fewer people . __eou__
He has worked five years in that bank . __eou__ He must be an experienced accountant . __eou__ You said it.Let ' s ask him to work in our bank . __eou__ Great minds think alike . __eou__
In my wedding ceremony , where do my parents sit in the church ? __eou__ The bride's parents ' seating arrangement is on the left side of the aisle and the groom's parents is on the right side . __eou__ Do friends of the bride always sit on one side of the church and friends of the groom on the other ? __eou__ They usually do . __eou__
I hear that Helen does not relate very well to her husband . __eou__ Unbelievable ! I remember her husband is her former classmate . They fell in love with each other in college . __eou__ So what ? Things have changed . __eou__
Have you met John ? __eou__ Yeah , he came back from America last week . __eou__ Have you noticed how fluently he speaks English ? He has only lived in America for less than three months . __eou__ He must have a good ear . __eou__
What was that noise ? __eou__ It was the pilot putting the wheels down.We must be coming into land.Are you frightened ? __eou__ Frightened ? You must be joking ! __eou__
What kind of jobs are becoming popular in your country ? __eou__ As in many countries , there ’ s been a big growth in anything related to computers . Young people are attracted to that field in particular . There ’ s also been a big growth in education . __eou__ There ’ s been a growth in that field in my country too . A lot of people want to learn practical and professional skills . __eou__ The interesting thing is that many of the teachers are not actually trained teachers . They are usually professionals who are taking a break from their jobs to pass on skills to others . __eou__ I noticed that too . What are the people learning ? __eou__ In my country , they are usually studying something business-related , such as marketing , management techniques , and human resource management . __eou__ I think that jobs in the leisure industry will become more popular in the future . __eou__ That trend has already begun in my country . In particular , there ’ s a big demand for people to work in fitness centers . Which kinds of jobs are less in demand ? __eou__ Those in traditional fields , such as agriculture and heavy industry . Younger people are not interested in doing those jobs and other countries have industries that can produce things much cheaper . __eou__ Yes . My country is certainly expanding in the service and hi-tech sectors , but contracting in the heavy industry and primary industry sectors . However , our car and aircraft manufacturers are doing very well . __eou__ They are well known for high quality , that ’ s why . __eou__
Is that true ? __eou__ I guess so . Now Anna's got four kids and another on the way . __eou__ Wow . She looks good for having had that many kids . She's pregnant and wearing Prada ! __eou__ That's Anna for you . She keeps up the image of the stylish Italian woman . Here she comes . __eou__ She's glowing . It must be the pregnancy . __eou__ Yeah , or the expensive Italian facial treatments . __eou__
That's brilliant ! We can name the grades of motor oil by where they come from . __eou__ Mr . Mechanic , I'd like a nice Venezuelan blend this morning . __eou__ I think the Saudi Arabian will hit the spot today . __eou__ But really , maybe this can work . Everyone loves coffee , and everyone needs motor oil . __eou__ A match made in heaven . __eou__
Remember that old man who used to beg for money on the street across from our house ? __eou__ Yeah . Whatever became of him ? __eou__ He got a job and now he owns a small grocery in town . __eou__ That's great . We should visit him some time . __eou__
I enjoy watching Channel 5.They always have films from all over the world . __eou__ How about the languages . __eou__ I can read the subtitles.My set is a huge-screen one . __eou__ That's more convenient . __eou__
We're in big trouble , Jason . Nick is beating us by a long shot . __eou__ Impossible ! Well , I'm not giving up yet . It's not over till the fat lady sings ! __eou__ OK , comeback kid . Here's you last question.How many times did Robin Williams win the Oscar for Best Actor ? __eou__ Hmm . Let's see ... there was Good Morning , Vietnam , Dead Poet's Society , The Fisher King ... Three , right ? __eou__ Nope , sorry ! Actually , Robin Williams has never won an Oscar for Best Actor--only for Best Supporting Actor ! __eou__
I found a new job after all , and I like this one even better than the last . __eou__ You see ? Every cloud has a silver lining . __eou__

I miss grandma . I dreamed about her yesterday . __eou__ Dear , let ’ s drop the subject . __eou__
Every honored guests , welcome to Hang Thou . Now we are visiting Tiger-running Spring . __eou__ How can we relate tiger to this spot , Miss Zhang ? __eou__ Its name originates from a legend that two tigers run here and made a hole , and then a spring gushed out from it . __eou__ How ignorant I am ! __eou__ The Longing Tea and the Tiger-running Spring water are always considered as the “ Two Wonders in West Lake . ” __eou__ I know that tea . It smells fragrant . __eou__ That's right . All my guests , attention please . We will have half an hour to visit the spring and take photos . And next spot will be the Moon Reflected in Three Pools . __eou__ Janice , David , come here . We take some photos here . I can't imagine how beautiful it is ! __eou__
Have you seen the tower in front of us . That's the famous Eiffel Tower . It was built in 1889 for the World's Fair . __eou__ How tall is this building ? __eou__ It stands 320m ( 1050ft ) high and held the record as the world's tallest structure until 1930 . __eou__ I have heard its name is connected with someone , is that right ? __eou__ Yes , the towel was named after its designer Gustave Eiffel . __eou__
Is the new computerised stock system in operation ? __eou__ Not quite . The software engineers are testing it just now . __eou__ Have all the operators been trained on it ? __eou__ Yes , most of them . We trained on a dummy system last month . A couple of people were away so we've organised two more training sessions on the live system for the whole team this week . __eou__
OK , so this is our newest machine . It was only installed last year . __eou__ What's the running speed of the machine ? __eou__ About 1,500 metres per minute . It's one of the fastest in the world . We had a few problems with it after start-up but it's running very well now . __eou__ And what's the maximum output ? __eou__ If we're running at full capacity , it's 160,000 tonnes per annum . __eou__

The environment varies greatly because of difference in language , customs and traditions . __eou__ Yes . This gap can be filled by export market research before exporting . __eou__ But the importance of the export research is often neglected by the managers . __eou__ That's right . They do not appreciate its value and consider it to be a luxury . __eou__ Therefore , when enterprises are spending a lot of money in trying to penetrate a new market , they should research whether their products can be sold at high enough a price and in a satisfactory amount . __eou__ Exactly ! __eou__
Both of the two young ladies are the candidates for the position __eou__ The question is we only need one . __eou__ Right.The choice is yours , the tall one or the short one ? __eou__ I should take the taller one for the choice . __eou__

Are the expressions of sight draft , time draft , usance draft and letter of credit adequate terms to express the different methods of payment ? __eou__ No . These terms need to be amplified . __eou__ What if the sale is made on the basis of sight draft ? __eou__ Then the shipping documents have to be attached . That way , both parties confirm the documents that will accompany the draft and constitute evidence of shipment in compliance with the contract terms . __eou__ Therefore , we must be very careful in building up clear expressions and complete understanding on both sides of trade . __eou__ Yes , that's very important . __eou__
It's going to strike 12 o'clock . Let's get the firecrackers ready , Rose . __eou__ Aren't firecrackers forbidden in the city ? __eou__ Well yes , but they are not allowed only in downtown areas . It's OK here . It would be difficult to ban customs that have thousands of years of tradition . The habit does bring kids joy and excitement so long as precautions are taken . Let's go out and set off firecrackers out there . __eou__ Fantastic ! The whole city is echoing with crackling sounds ! __eou__ What other activities will you have tomorrow ? __eou__ Quite a lot . The celebration of the New Year has just started . The first day we southerners have sweet rice cakes for breakfast , and people in the North have Jiaozi . Afterward , we will make New Year calls on family relatives , husband's side on the first day and wife's side on the second . __eou__ Do you bring some gifts along ? __eou__ That's for sure . Fruit , cream cakes , medical tonics are often for parents and aged relatives , and cash enclosed in a red envelope for the kids . All this , of course , should be well prepared beforehand . __eou__ Is it the same practice for all families ? __eou__ Not all the same nowadays I must say . Many families , especially those of newly married couples , choose to make an overseas trip to escape the routines . Rose and I had a tour to Singapore , Malaysia , Thailand and Hong Kong last year . We stayed there for two weeks until the last day of the holiday . __eou__ I really appreciate the way you Chinese people exchange feelings . The holiday's long enough for you to relax . __eou__ Well , for city dwellers , the Spring Festival is a holiday of seven days . While in the country where traditions are still heavily emphasized , the festival lasts ten days . __eou__
Why do all girls appear feminine after sophomore year ? __eou__ Because they are full-grown . Look at their curvy figures . __eou__ I feel they all talk and behave in a different way . __eou__ They suddenly become shy when they speak to boys . __eou__ Some even do make-up slightly . Are you aware that previous ' small potato ' Ma Xiaoxiao becomes a piece of cheese cake recently ? __eou__ She is certainly not my kind of girl . __eou__ Stop preaching your dream love Marilyn Monroe to me . I know those sexy women are your tastes . __eou__ You are so Platonic . Those naive girls will eventually grow into real women . They can't resist love , and men cannot resist their attraction either . __eou__ I appreciate the saying ' Love consists in this , that two solitude protect , border and salute each other . ' __eou__

His Chinese name is Cheng Long . __eou__ Ha , I know Cheng Long a lot , he has made 40 films since 1976 . And at that time he was promoted as the new Bruce Lee . But I'm not familiar with his English name . __eou__ OK . Then tell me what else you know . __eou__ Some movie stars measure their worth by how many millions of dollars they make . Do you know how Jackie Chan measures his worth ? __eou__ He measures his worth by how many of his bones he has fractured while executing his film , incredible stunts . By the way , can you count the breaks ? __eou__ Sure . His skull , his eyes , his nose , three times , his jaw , his shoul-der , is chest , two fingers , a knee .

It makes you look so attractive in a super tie . __eou__ Match is important ; well , the way of tying is also important . __eou__ My father dose not know how to tie a tie , for he often wears a cravat . __eou__ My father wears a tie every day , but he can ’ t do it himself . My mother helps him with his tie every morning . __eou__ You mother is not only a patient mother but also a gentle wife . __eou__

I'd rather show Bean in a garter belt , but all in good time . __eou__ Inspiration can come in the strangest ways ... __eou__
How often are stockholders meetings held ? __eou__ Stockholders meetings are held biannually . Usually the meetings are scheduled for spring and fall . In between the meetings , each stockholder receives biannual reports . Financial statements are made once a year . __eou__ What percentage of the stockholders actually attend the meetings ? I'm guessing not a large percentage ... __eou__ You're right , it's a low percentage . Also , in order to attend meetings , you have to hold a certain amount of shares . It's quite a large number , so most of the stockers are excluded from proceedings . __eou__ So , how much say do the stockholders really have ? __eou__ Unless they're united , very little ... __eou__

China is now a member of world trade organization . As a member of TO , China will have to make some changes in its economic policies so that it can follow the routines practiced by other TO members . Is it fair to China , do you think ? __eou__ It's a hard question , but I'm sure the reexamination of China's economic policies in the past may lead us to a right answer to the question . After the establishment of new China , our government employed numerous economics policies to stimulate the growth of China's economy . These policies , however , favored our domestic enterprises and protected them from international competition and these policies have contributed a lot to the rapid growth of both China economy and our domestic enterprises . After China's entry into TO , Chinese domestic enterprises will have to compete with their foreign counterparts . This new situation entails some changes of Chinese economic policies . These changes will spur Chinese enterprises to strengthen their competitiveness in the long run . __eou__ We can infer that the non-discrimination principle is one of the most important principles of TO agreement . This principle requires equal treatment of domestic and foreign enterprise . Does the principle also apply to domestic enterprise of different ownerships ? __eou__ Yes , it does . Domestic enterprises of different ownerships enjoy equal rights for the non-discrimination principle grants equal rights to enterprises , regardless of their nationality and ownership . I have found that although changes of China's economic policies are numerous , these changes are largely based on the most important economic principle ot TO agreement-non-discrimination principle . Such an understanding of principle of the changes may help us not only to have a good insight into the changes but also to foresee the tendency of the new changes of China's economic policies . __eou__

They closed down the workshop in 1980 and opened up a new factory in Leeds . __eou__ When did it become CABS ? __eou__ In 1997 - when it was bought by a German company . They set up two more business in the UK . __eou__ What does CABS stand for ? __eou__ International Air Braking Systems . __eou__
Mr . Brown , I'd like to talk with you about something that is getting to be a problem . I'd like , if possible , to see it settled at this meeting . __eou__ What is it , Mrs . Wang ? __eou__ It's about the quality of 300 cartons of dried mushrooms . They reached us two weeks ago , and were immediately examined after they arrived . To our astonishment , about 20 % of them were moldy and in many cartons there were even small brownish bugs crawling in and out of the half eaten mushrooms . We can't accept them in this state . They are unfit for human consumption . And the Medical Officer of Health has issued a Stop Notice on them . __eou__ Is that so ? So far we haven't had any complaint of this kind . Our mushrooms have enjoyed a good reputation for their superior quality for years . We are really at a loss to understand why your lot was found moldy and wormeaten . Have you any evidence ? __eou__ Certainly . Here's a survey report by a well-known lab in London , whose testimony is absolutely reliable . __eou__ Though everything may be as you say , there are many factors involved . What's more , your surveyors have not mentioned any cause for the damage . __eou__ The mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags , sixty of these bags to a carton . It is stated on the surveyor ? s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact . So it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing . __eou__ As you know , before shipment , the Commodity InspectionBureau inspected the goods in question . They concluded that the goods were well dehydrated from fresh and choice material and up to standard for export . __eou__ I think the Inspection Bureau at your end , when effecting inspection , only selected a few package at random these happened to be up to the standard . The part that was not dried properly , most probably , escaped their attention . As the amount in question is only 20 % of the whole shipment , I think it is only reasonable that you should compensate us for the loss . __eou__ The inspection certificate , which is based on a random selection of 20 % of the consignment as we've agreed on beforehand , is considered final and binding upon both parties . We do not accept any claims for compensation for loss incurred in transit , because you bought the goods F . O . B . Houston and on shipping quality , not on landed quality . Your claim , in our opinion , should be referred to the insurance company , as the mishap occurred after shipment . __eou__ We've already got in touch with the underwriter . But they have refused to accept any liability . They attributed the accident to the effects of dampness during the long sea voyage . __eou__ That's a matter over which we could exercise no control , then . I'm afraid I have to insist that you approach the insurance company for settlement , that is , if you have covered this risk in your coverage . __eou__ To my regret , we failed to cover contamination . This is an unfortunate oversight on our part and a lesson to us . __eou__ Otherwise the insurance company would no doubt have entertained your case . __eou__ Well , live and learn . It seems we'll have to waive the claim . __eou__
Well , do you have any experience in guiding ? __eou__ Yes , but I only have few experiences . I guided a few groups of foreign tourists from America last winter vacation . I showed them around some places of interest . __eou__ What places of interest did you show them ? __eou__ Too many . I will just give you one example , Huangguoshu Falls , the largest waler-fall in China . __eou__
What is the proper way to sit at a dinner table ? __eou__ Ideal posture is to sit straight , but not stiff , against the back of the chair . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Hands , when one is not actually eating , may be in the lap . Tipping one's chair is unforgivable . __eou__
Such bad luck , 200 yuan was stolen by a thief on the bus today . __eou__ Don't be angry , you lose money just to avoid misfortune . __eou__ Well , you can just comfort yourself like that . __eou__
How many people does your company employ ? __eou__ We have over sixty employees . We have about forty factory workers and technical people and the rest are admin and sales staff . We started off with only ten people , so our workforce has grown a lot . __eou__ What's your annual turnover ? __eou__ It was just over two million euros last year . __eou__
We have successfully fulfilled our work plan . In fact , we are No . 1 in terms of market share . __eou__ You have gotten amazing success . Congratulations ! __eou__ I hope we can continue to get support from the departments concerned . __eou__ Without a doubt . Relevant department will try their best . __eou__
How did you first meet Jack each other ? __eou__ That is a heavy raining afternoon . I was standing under the eaves of a shop to evade the heavy rain . It's getting dark . __eou__ And then ? __eou__ I was trembling in the wind when he ran to me with an umbrella in his hand and asked , ' Where is your home ? ' __eou__ Then he sent you to your home ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ It's a romantic meeting . I can say that a hero saves a beauty . __eou__ He joked later that I was so poor that he had a kind of impulse to protect an ant . __eou__ He is so humorous . __eou__
I've something very unpleasant to talk with you . Upon the arrival of the first consignment , it was found that about 50 % of the sixty cases of pineapples were leaking . __eou__ It's rather an unusual case . Have you found the cause of leaking ? __eou__ It ’ s simply because the tins were damaged . __eou__ It appears to be the only case to us , that the goods have been damaged on the way . __eou__ I am sorry to say it's not on the way , but during loading . The tins inside the cases were broken evidently through rough handling . __eou__ Could you offer us a certificate issued by your Health Department ? __eou__ Certainly . Here you are . Our health authorities said they were no longer suitable for human consumption . I have to remind you that our terms are CIF Hamburg . I hope you would indemnify us for the loss , so it wouldn't be so heavy on us . __eou__ Now we are prepared to settle the issue with you amicably . __eou__
I am sorry to trouble you again , Mr.Stone . __eou__ It's ok . What do you want to ask ? __eou__ Where should I go after I arrived at the university ? __eou__ The first place you should go is the International Center . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ You can get help there in dealing with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service ; you can find Foreign Student Advisers . __eou__ What kind of role do foreign student advisers play ? __eou__ They'll discuss personal concerns , housing , adjustment , finances and other matters with you . __eou__ Can we get any more help at the International Center ? __eou__ Yes , a lot more . If you go there just before the beginning of the fall's semester , you can get your student ID and social security number there . They will keep your documents up-to-date . They will offer an orientation program for new comers . They will also help you contact your department and registration office . __eou__ I see . It must be worth going to . __eou__ Besides these , the center staff also works with community organizations which provide tours , home hospitality , speaking engagements and assistance for wives of foreign students . In cooperation with nationality clubs , student associations and other organizations , the International Center provides a varied program of cultural and social events throughout the year . __eou__ Wonderful . It is a home for foreign students . __eou__ It sure is . They also serve tea , coffee and refreshments . The Center staff members are also friendly and helpful . Everyone loves them . __eou__
What are your working hours ? __eou__ Eight to twelve in the morning , two to six in the afternoon . __eou__ Much better than mine . __eou__ What are your hours ? __eou__ Mine aren't fixed . Sometimes I do the day shift , sometimes the night shift . __eou__
Hello , Mr . Gao . We appreciate your letting us have the apartment . __eou__ My pleasure . You're a sweet couple . Do you have any questions ? __eou__ The ad said rent was thirty thousand . That includes utilities and phone , I assume . __eou__ No , it doesn't . And there's a maintenance fee for each month . It's forty NT per ping . __eou__ That's another one thousand six hundred ? __eou__ Yes , but that doesn't include cable . It's for cleaning and trash removal . You just leave your trash outside your door . __eou__
Terrible . How about people's lives ? __eou__ Fortunately , there is no person died . __eou__ That's great . It seems that Typhoon is not as bad as earthquake . __eou__ Yeah . Earthquake is one of the most badly natural disasters in the world . __eou__ That's why many people died in the earthquake . __eou__ Well , China is located on the Eurasia plate , where earthquakes happen frequently due to the earth's plates knocking against each other . __eou__ Oh , China does have been plagued by numerous destructive earthquakes during its long history . __eou__ Yeah , we've experienced the 8.0 magnitude earthquake in Wenchman . __eou__ We're all familiar with natural disasters . but we still feel weak when we face Wenchman earthquake . __eou__ Right . But people at that time only know two words , " save " and " assistance " , they will never don't lift a finger . Life is the most important compared with anything else . __eou__ That's the point . Love among human beings is not limited by geography . __eou__
Guess who I saw just now ? __eou__ Who ? __eou__ John Smith , the escaped criminal . __eou__ That bad egg , who took the low road since he was a boy . __eou__ I think I must report to the cops . __eou__ Ok . __eou__
I wish our competition will quit poaching our people , when Susan resigned last week to work for the Sunburst , she was our fourth employee to leave us for them . __eou__ Have you ever considered that perhaps we have a morale problem among our employees ? If everyone is discontent with their work , of course they won't stick arround . __eou__ Well , those do leave will soon find out the grass isn't as green on the other side of sense as they thought it was , I know Sunburst is suffering from inbreeding . __eou__ Inbreeding is a big drawback from snitching most of their employers from one or two companies . __eou__ With Susan leaving , we should probably look to someone new on board . __eou__ Our human resource department is working on it , it's not easy to recruit new employees every few month , it's hard to find qualified people . __eou__ Maybe we should start shopping around the competitors people . __eou__
After this lunch , I haven ’ t got much green left . __eou__ Poor Ben , your wife is too mean to you . She gives you so little money every time when you are out . __eou__
Julia and Anne have both taken dance lessons.They want to be famous dancer , I think . __eou__ Yet Julia is not a patch on Anne because she's not as diligent and clever as Anne . __eou__ I don't see much difference , anyway . __eou__
We have some quality-control problems . Mr . Zhang . We need to go to the source to work them out . __eou__ What problems are you having exactly ? __eou__ The complaint rate for our new product line is very high , almost eight percent . __eou__ That is high . __eou__ Yes . We keep finding problems when testing the sound boards . __eou__ But your promotional materials claim the broads are the least expensive of their types on the market . __eou__ The least expensive , but still fully functional . And we think that your factory needs to take measures to improve quality-control . __eou__ That will involve additional expenses for us , which we will have to pass on to you as a rate hike . __eou__ I am afraid that is not acceptable . Your contract says that you will deliver a product with a reject rate of less than six percent . __eou__ Well . I will tell you what , Mr . Li . I will review the contract and talk with management . Then we will get together and hash this out . __eou__
Linda , have you prepared fully for tomorrow's meeting ? __eou__ Yes , Mr . Li . Everyone has been informed . __eou__ Great , we don't expect any big problems to happen . __eou__ I see . __eou__
Mrs . Schmidt ! What's happening ! __eou__ You'll never guess what happened today ! I went to the doctor after work and the doctor told me ... __eou__ And the doctor told you to start listening to Bach ? __eou__ No ... He told me I'm pregnant ! __eou__ Congratulations ! __eou__ And so I bought all these books on having kids and ... __eou__ And they said you should play classical music ? __eou__ How did you know ! They say listening to classical music can make your baby smarter ! __eou__
OK , everyone . Gather around . Here are the rules . No tackling . No pushing . __eou__ You shouldn't grab someone else's shirt . That's a foul . __eou__ Play is stopped when the person with the ball is touched . __eou__ You can touch them only between the shoulder and the knees . __eou__ The touchdown lines are there and there . OK , let's play ! __eou__ Before we start , let's have a moment of silence for our fallen men . __eou__
Does the material stand washing ? __eou__ Sure.This material is not only washable but also unshrinkable , sun-resistant , crease-resistant , resilient . __eou__ Is it drip-dry ? __eou__ Yes , you have a good eye for materials . __eou__
Any chance of using your telephone ? __eou__ You ’ Ve been using it for two weeks without paying . __eou__ Well , I thought it was not that serious . __eou__
Are the galaxies in the universe moving through space ? __eou__ No , the galaxies sit more or less passively in the space around them . But not too much . As the space between galaxies expands , it carries the galaxies further apart - like raisins in an expanding dough . __eou__ But I heard that our Milky way galaxy may one day collide with a neighboring galaxy . If galaxies are moving apart from each other , how can they collide ? __eou__ Well , the universe is a chaotic place , and the gravity from one galaxy , or from a group of galaxies , may disturb the motion of its near neighbors , causing them to collide . However , on average , when you compare two large enough chunks of space , the galaxies in one are moving away from the galaxies in the other . __eou__ Wow , you're really informative . Thanks a lot . __eou__ You're welcome . __eou__
You look tired . Did you sleep well last night ? __eou__ I stayed up all night writing a report . __eou__ Go easy . Overwork is bad for your health . __eou__
How about a movie on Sunday , Mum ? __eou__ Well , I'm afraid your father's not interested in modern films . __eou__ We could find a classical one . __eou__ That sounds fine . __eou__
Lily thinks that the job takes a back seat to the family after she is married . __eou__ She must be a good wife . __eou__ Not necessarily . This is only what she says , not what she does . __eou__ I see . __eou__
Which way is the dining car ? __eou__ Two cars forward . __eou__ What time will breakfast be served ? __eou__ 7:00 , sir . __eou__
Have you watched any of the talent shows on TV ? __eou__ Yes , I've watched the finale for the ' Super Girl ' . The producer is very smart to copy the program from the US , which is quite fresh and eye-catching for mainland audiences . __eou__ Yeah , and they know exactly what the audiences have in mind . Everyone desires equal opportunities and a channel to climb up the social ladder all the way to the highest in society . __eou__ That ' s why the program has attracted so many star-wanna-bes . __eou__ But it seems that these talent shows are getting less popular these days . There's no such program on this year . __eou__ Yeah , these programs are gradually losing their appeal . __eou__ No surprise . The over-the-top promotion has ruined the audiences ' appetite . __eou__ And they lack originality . Talent shows like ' Super Girl ' and ' Super Boy ' are largely clones of ' The American Idol ' . __eou__ The same is true for ' My Hero ' . Winners of the contest used to star in the TV series ' The Frog Prince ' . __eou__ I think producers are underestimating the audience . They should think of better ways to entertain the general public . __eou__
That new Sony camcorder you've got is just beautiful . __eou__ Yeah.It is the very latest in digital video cameras . __eou__ I can see digital video products are quickly going mainstream with their plunging price . __eou__ Getting cheaper is not the only reason for their popularity.They come with a lot of inviting functions . __eou__ Such as ? __eou__ They offer clearer and sharper images . Many of them also have up to 20x optical zoom lenses , a photo mode and fast-action mode . __eou__ They are very compact and are designed to be used with one hand . __eou__ Right ! Anyway , the basic difference between a digital camcorder and its traditional counterpart is that it speaks digital . __eou__ What does this mean ? __eou__ This means digital camcorders can be connected with the digital equipments you have at home , like your digital TV or your computer . __eou__ I can transfer my home video clips from my camcorder to my computer for editing . __eou__ Sure ! And without any conversion process or loss of quality ! You quickly find , cut , and record video segments and create slide shows . Some camcorders even offer editing software for adding titles and special effects . __eou__ What special effects ? __eou__ Like creating a sepia tone look and some special effects such as fades and dissolves . __eou__ That's great ! __eou__ With the development of the broad band Internet , you can easily upload your video files to websites or e-mail them to relatives or business partners . __eou__ So everybody's getting video mail . __eou__
I often sneeze after having a bad itch inside my nose . Sometimes this is accompanied by an itching throat . __eou__ Any other discomfort ? __eou__ Yes . Sometimes I can notice a constriction in the chest and shortness of breath after a fit of sneezing . And I often suffer from a running nose with a profuse watery discharge . __eou__ Does it occur seasonally or all year round ? __eou__ It has been seasonal during these past three years . __eou__ Are you sensitive to other things ? __eou__ Yes , things like seafood and penicillin-type drugs . __eou__ OK . Let me examine your nose . According to your case history and the examination , I believe that it's allergic rhinitis . __eou__ What useful treatment can you offer ? __eou__ I'll give you a series of specific skin tests . Then we'll know exactly what substances you're allergic to . Then I'll give you some causes of desensitization therapy . __eou__
I am an eloquent speaker in the classroom . But when I face a stranger outside , I get tongue-tied and nothing comes out . __eou__ You should pay close attention to your manner of speaking . Speech is a reflection of personality , you know . You should reflect confidence by speaking in a low voice , loud enough to be heard without being aggressive or overpowering . __eou__ I will go out of my way to catch the attention of the interviewer . __eou__ Your speech should not call attention to itself , but should reveal your individuality and ability . __eou__ I ’ m very shy . I think I might shake in my boots at the moment I meet the interviewer . __eou__ You ’ d better overcome your nervousness . it is considered an indication that you lack self-confidence . __eou__ Another problem is that I dare not look into their eyes whenever I meet strangers , especially foreigners . __eou__ In China , it is impolite to look into the senior speakers eyes while speaking . But in Western countries it is the opposite . Eye contact gives a strong feeling of sincerity . Looking downwards or sideways shows that you are either insincere or absent-minded . __eou__ Is there anything else that I should pay attention to in an interview ? __eou__ Yes . Don ’ t eat onions or garlic before you come . If you do you ’ ll have bad breath . __eou__ I ’ ll remember to bring gum with me . __eou__ You should never chew gum or smoke during an interview , even if you are allowed to do so . __eou__ I remember now . Your advice is very helpful . __eou__
Do you like climbing ? __eou__ Yes , I like it very much . __eou__ How about climbing up the Fragrant Mountain tomorrow ? __eou__ Where is it ? __eou__ It is located at the east foot of Western Mountain of Beijing , in a park with the same name . There are some huge stones within the mountain which look like the censer , so it is called ' Fragrant Mountain ' . __eou__ Have you visited it before ? __eou__ Many times . Except climbing , there are many attractions worth visiting . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ It is the best season to view red leaves from the Mid-October to the first ten days of November . During the period , thousands of hectares of maples on the sloping field are so red that you would recognize them as fallen petals by mistake if looking from a further area . The bright red , pink , scarlet , and peach-puff leaves are distributed in different layout , with some green pines and cypresses dotted in between . __eou__ Sounds marvelous . __eou__ You can take a bird-eye view at the glorious picture when you arrive at the top of the mountain . __eou__ Great . I will prepare some clothes and food for the climbing . __eou__
You're right--Italian ! Ha ! Ha ! I was trying to trick you , but you didn't fall for it ! __eou__ I almost did ! Actually , I don't know that much about coffee , even though I sell it . __eou__ I could give you a few pointers if you want . I know a lot about coffee . __eou__ Thanks . Maybe if things slow down later I'll stop by your table . __eou__ I'm Robert , at your service . __eou__ Rita . Nice to meet you . __eou__
There have been too many unplanned shutdowns over the past few months . We'll have to make a few changes to the way we operate . We need to reduce our downtime . __eou__ I agree , but the maintenance team is fully stretched dealing with problems . We don't have time to carry out any preventive maintenance . __eou__ We need to establish routine maintenance procedures . It costs us too much in lost production if we wait until something breaks down before we fix it . __eou__
Shit , so crowded ! __eou__ The radio said it's OK on this road . __eou__ Things change every minute . __eou__ We have too many cars ! __eou__
Do you like the room ? __eou__ Yes . What is the rent ? __eou__ $ 300 per month . __eou__ Then what's the rent due date ? __eou__ At the beginning of the month . Besides , you should pay me $ 1000 as deposit . __eou__
Hey , The Cosby Show is on ! __eou__ The Cosby Show ? Wasn't it over many years ago ? __eou__ That's right . __eou__ So how come it's still playing ? __eou__ I'm watching reruns of it . __eou__ Reruns ? __eou__ That means our local TV station is showing old episodes . You can watch reruns of nearly every old sitcom . __eou__
Tomorrow's Carl's birthday ? __eou__ Yes.Let ' s hold a birthday party for him , shall we ? __eou__ Good idea ! Let's make ready , then . __eou__
Look out ! Your tea water is running over . __eou__ Oh , would you please turn off the fire ? My hands are sticky with the dough . __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
You really should stop smoking , you know . __eou__ I know . I know . I don ’ t smoke too much , though . __eou__ How many cigarettes do you smoke a day ? __eou__ About a pack , more if I drink . __eou__ Wow . You ’ re really a heavy smoker . __eou__ No , I ’ m not . My father smoked two packs a day for forty years . __eou__ He died of lung cancer , right ? __eou__ Yeah ... you ’ re right . I really should stop smoking . __eou__
Bob was late for work this morning . __eou__ Has he been late before ? __eou__ Yes , once last week . __eou__ Thanks for letting me know . __eou__
Did you working in a similar position before ? __eou__ Yes . I have been with ABC Insurance Company for four years , and before that , I worked with the Pacific surveyor company as claim officer . __eou__ Could you tell me the usual procedures to handle such a case ? __eou__ Yes , on the shipper's side , when the cargos arrives , all relevant documents will be forwarded to the consignee.Among other things , this party has to check carefully the content of the packing list and weight list.When cargos are found to be damaged of short landed , this party has to call for a joint survey by representatives of the shipping company and the insurance agent.Based on the survey report , they will lodge a clam for compensation . __eou__ If you act as our representative what would you do to safeguard our interest ? __eou__ I think , first of all , I would ask the consignee to produce survey report on loading , if they can't produce that I would suggest them to refer the case to their shipper . Meanwhile , bad weather could be agood excuse to refuse the responsibility . __eou__ Are you able to operate the telex ? __eou__ Yes , I used to dispatch telex to shippers and the consignee to inform them of changes of our schedule and other information . __eou__ Now can you tell me if you have a good command of both written and spoken English ? __eou__ When I was college , I passed Band Six of College English Test.All the foreign business men I've dealt with say my English is quite good . __eou__ If you are selected for the position , you must prepare to travel overseas frequently . __eou__ No problem , I love it.Thank you for granting me the interview . __eou__
Are you still hungry , Ryan ? How about some more squid balls ? __eou__ Squid balls ? How about some more fruit ! __eou__ Wow ! You really like fruit , huh ? You've already had 3 plates ! __eou__ Yeah , it's funny . I usually don't ever eat fruit ... __eou__ Well , whatever suits your fancy . I'll press the service button again . __eou__
Bang ? ! Bang ! Bang ! What are the Kings doing at seven o ’ clock on Sunday morning ? __eou__ Well , Mr . King is singing . __eou__ Yes , but what ’ s the banging noise ? __eou__ He ’ s standing on a ladder and banging some nails into the wall with a hammer . Now he ’ s hanging some strong strings on the nails . __eou__ And what ’ s Mrs . King doing ? __eou__ She ’ s bringing something pink for Mr . King to drink . Now she ’ s putting it ... OK . __eou__ What ’ s happening ? __eou__ The ladder ’ s falling ? __eou__ What ’ s Mr . King doing ? __eou__ He ’ s hanging from the string . He ’ s holding onto the string with his fingers and shouting to Mrs . King . __eou__ And is she helping him ? __eou__ No , she ’ s running toward our house . That ’ s her ringing the bell . __eou__ Well , I ’ m not going to answer it . I ’ m sleeping . __eou__
Bill , I must tell you the truth . You failed the English exam again . __eou__ Ah ? Really ? That stinks ! __eou__ Haha . April Fool's ! Did you forget what day it is today ? __eou__ Wow , you were pulling my leg all along . I was really fooled . __eou__ Alright , now let's be serious . Actually , you get high marks in the exam . __eou__
This is a very beautiful statue . What's it called ? __eou__ It's called ' Endless Love ' . It was a gift from a sister city in Australia for the 100th anniversary of the city . __eou__ 100th anniversary ? When was that ? __eou__ Just two months ago . There were very big celebrations and there was a spectacular fireworks display . I took part in the great parade myself . __eou__ Sounds real good . It's a pity that I missed that . __eou__ Yes . We all loved the celebration of our city's birthday . It made the people feel so proud of our city . __eou__
Tiffany , why are more and more people turning to the Web to find a mate ? __eou__ I think that , as more people use the Internet for both work and pleasure , it makes more sense as a tool to connect with people , and the stigma of meeting someone online is reduced . __eou__ There are actually special sites for people looking to date within their specific ethnic group and age group . But how should you screen potential mates ? Do you suggest talking to them on the phone right away or communicating via e-mail ? __eou__ I would say do not make the e-mail exchange too long . A lot of times a connection via e-mail creates almost a false sense of intimacy . Quickly make sure there is a connection in the physical world . __eou__ Can you give us any other safety tips for people pursuing relationships on the Net ? __eou__ I'd suggest you not give out too much personal information , like your home address , until after several dates . Just keep up the same guards you would keep up if you were meeting any stranger . __eou__ Besides the growth of these matchmaker sites , do you have any stats on success rates ? Are people out there finding true and lasting love through the Internet __eou__ Well , for a site like ecrush.com , since their debut in Valentine's Day in 1999 , of the 1.5 million people who have joined ecrush.com , 300000 have actually matched . __eou__ Do you have any successful stories to share ? __eou__ Yes , the couple that I highlighted at today's show met on Match.com and they're getting married this summer . __eou__
Here's some dancing . See those guys stomping , clapping and shouting ? They're practicing step-dancing . __eou__ It sounds cool . The rhythms look really difficult . __eou__ They basically turn their bodies into drums . There's a national step competition every year . __eou__ Well , black people are supposed to be great dancers . __eou__ Wen ! That's only a stereotype . Like all Asians are supposed to be math geniuses . I'm not a great dancer , and you said you failed calculus . __eou__ Ha-ha ! You got me there ! __eou__
I'm reading an interesting report on Mars . __eou__ Oh , what does it say ? Does it say water could still exist under the surface of Mars ? __eou__ Absolutely ! It says there is water on Mars buried beneath the surface . It's just a matter of how deep it is . __eou__ Then could the soil on Mars somehow be fertile enough to Groh simple plants ? __eou__ The soil would need quite a bit of fertilizer to grow anything . And it would need to be protected from the UV radiation . __eou__ Actually , we are doing a project in school that involves landing a ship and staying on Mars for an extended period of time . Does NASA have any type of portable habitats that could be used to stay on the planet ? __eou__ I'm not sure NASA has built any portable habitats for extended stays on Mars , but they have looked at various designs . __eou__ One of the most exciting things about Mars is that there could have bean life on it . What are your personal opinions on the life on Mars theory ? __eou__ Well , I'm not really an expert in this area , but my understanding is that anything is possible . It's just that it is so hard to determine what went on 4.5 billion years ago . __eou__ But maybe there is a chance of gradually improving the surface and atmosphere of Mars so it may be inhabitable by humans . __eou__ I'm skeptical . Mars is made of rocks containing silicon , iron , and various minerals . It also has an atmosphere of carbon dioxide . It is so different from what we have on earth , you know . __eou__ I'd still like to hope that some day we could set up a human colony there . __eou__ But there are still other big problems we need to solve such as prolonged weightlessness , food storage , and a series of physiological effects . __eou__
Mark is parade his knowledge again . __eou__ Yeah ! He ’ s very good at showing off his knowledge . __eou__ A well-learned person never does that . __eou__
I've been accepted by the university , and they've offered me a position on the basketball team ! __eou__ That's wonderful ! Icing on the cake . __eou__
Bob is getting on in years . __eou__ Yeah , I'm very worried about his health . __eou__ He looks tired all the time . __eou__ He's working too hard . __eou__
He is planning again . __eou__ Yeah . But whatever the planes are , he always has an eye to money . __eou__ That is him . __eou__
It seems that many boys are fighting there . __eou__ Break it up ! I will not permit fighting in this campus . __eou__
You're going go Dresden for sightseeing ? __eou__ Yeah.And I'm going by bus . __eou__ I think a train journey is as fast as a bus journey . __eou__ But both my wife and I prefer taking a bus . __eou__
Are you coming to the bridal shower for Jane ? __eou__ Yes , I am . When is the wedding ? __eou__ Aug 8 . __eou__ August bride . How nice ! By the way , who is going to be the matron of honor ? __eou__ Mrs . White . __eou__ Oh , yeah ? I wonder who is going to give Jane away at the wedding . You know her father passed away several years ago . __eou__ Maybe her uncle will . __eou__ I think so . The wedding will be held at her church , right ? __eou__ Right . Red Rochester will officiate at the wedding . __eou__ Do you know where they will go on their honeymoon ? __eou__ Yes , Jane says they will go to China . __eou__
Has your company been affected much by government legislation ? __eou__ Yes , we have . We've had to clean up our production process a lot to meet tough government standards . __eou__ What about your use of raw materials ? __eou__ Well , we've had to cut down the amount of solvents we use and we ’ re not allowed to use lead in our products any more . __eou__ What happens if you exceed the limits ? __eou__ We try not to because you might have to pay quite a heavy fine . __eou__
So tell me , what's the difference between the Board of Directors , the CEO , and the stockholders ? They all seems ot be the same group of people to me ... __eou__ No , there's a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . Then there's the CEO — the chief executive officer . He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased . __eou__ How many people are on the board of directors ? __eou__ Usually not more than 15 , not less than 10 . They meet monthly , quarterly , or biannually to oversee an organization or company . They provide long term planing and vision , and also act as moral watchdogs rto keep the company in line . __eou__
Is the lake very polluted ? __eou__ Well , I wouldn't swim in it - but the water is much cleaner than it was a few years ago . __eou__ Are local factories allowed to discharge waste water into the lake ? __eou__ Yes , but it must be treated in an effluent treatment plant first . __eou__
It seems to me that everything is going digital nowadays . __eou__ Yes . Speaking of digital wares , I bought a digital camera last week . __eou__ Cool ! What brand __eou__ A Sony . It's only one third the size of my old camera and looks rather smart . __eou__ What about the quality ? __eou__ Superb ! It's a 4 megapixel one and the photos it takes are very vivid and clear . __eou__
My elder aunt feels like vomiting , she is pregnant . __eou__ She'd better drink plenty of hot water and lie in bed . __eou__ But she feels like having no appetite at all if she stays at home all day . __eou__ Don't worry . She will be all right . __eou__
Is Jack still staying idle everyday ? __eou__ No , he has mended his way . After his father died , he set his hand to the job of putting his business affairs in order . __eou__ Really ? He is so competent now . __eou__ You can ’ t imagine what he is like now . __eou__
Ok . Let ’ s look at our short presentation on China . What do we need to include ? __eou__ We need to talk about the size of the country and its population . __eou__ Ok . China is about the same size as Canada and the united states and it has a population of about 1.3 billion , making it the latest country in the world by population . __eou__ It says here that most of the people are han Chinese , but there are 55 minorities that make up almost 10 % of the population . __eou__ We need to say something about the geography and climate of china . Is there any way to divide the country into sections ? __eou__ We could divide into five parts . There ’ s the northeast , which is mild in summer and very cold in winter . Then there is the northwest , which is largely desert . Tillet is famous for its mountainous climate . The rest of the country can be roughly divided into two parts . One is temperate-mild in winter and warm in summer . Then , in the south it is hot most of the year . __eou__ That sounds very general . __eou__ It is , buy remember that we only have a few minutes to make our presentation . We can select cities from each part and give data for each one . __eou__ One from each part ? Lhasa , Urumqi , Harbin , shanghai , and hongkong . The capital city is Beijing , right ? __eou__ Yes . The other large cities are Chengdu , Dalian , Wuhan , tianjin , shenyang , Chongqing . Hongkong and Guangzhou . __eou__ We should take a large map and highlight those cities . What is each of them famous for ? __eou__
Last week , we had a performance review on all the staff in our department in last quarter . Stevens , can you provide more information about the performance review ? __eou__ Yes , sir . Most of us had positive review in last quarter . Take Fred and David for examples . Both of them try their best to achieve the best . Their progress is distinct , especially in last quarter . __eou__ They are popular in and out of our department . Fred is easygoing , while David is cautious in working . __eou__ All these say a lot for their characters . __eou__ So , I want to recommend them for a raise . Fred is promoted to be the assistant of manager in marketing department and David to be director of office . __eou__
Hey , Trev ! How did the shopping go ? __eou__ “ You ain't nothing ' but a hound-dog ... ” __eou__ Trev , are you OK ? __eou__ Of course I'm OK ! I just bought a bunch of classic Elvis records ! __eou__ Aren't you lucky . The vintage-clock guy is driving a hard bargain . So I have nothing . __eou__ No sweat . Just go back and talk him down . Here comes Wei . __eou__
The concert was really great . __eou__ I agree . __eou__ The singing group used to be very popular . __eou__ I can't believe they would play so good . __eou__
We'd better leave now . __eou__ I beg your pardon ? __eou__
Bill , do you know when did the Chinese begin to celebrate Teachers ' Day ? __eou__ I know the Chinese teachers had their first festival in 1985 . __eou__ So , it is the 27th Teachers ' Day . __eou__ What will you do on Teachers ' Day ? __eou__ I am going to send Mr . Li some flowers . What about you ? __eou__ I intend to invite him to dinner . __eou__
Well , I've never downloaded music before . How does it work ? __eou__ You haven't ? If you've never tried it I can show you how . __eou__ Alright . But why is downloading music better than buying Cds at the store ? __eou__ Downloading music is really fast and convenient , and you can preview all the songs before you buy them . __eou__
The man behind your mother must be your elder brother . __eou__ Yes , he was 29 then . __eou__ He looked his age . __eou__
Can you name some festivals of religious nature ? __eou__ Yes , such as Christmas and Easter . __eou__ What about historic festivals ? __eou__ Thanksgiving Day , Independence Day . __eou__
Which is your preference , tea or coffee ? __eou__ My choice would always be tea . __eou__ When did you form this hobby ? __eou__ Last year when I visited China . __eou__
Does it bother you that your husband goes away on long business trips ? __eou__ No.The time we have spent apart has been good for us.Absence makes the heart grow fonder . __eou__
Honey , where did you buy this skirt ? __eou__ In the market . Any problem ? __eou__ Nothing . I am just checking . __eou__
I wonder if the dentist could fit me in early tomorrow . __eou__ I'm afraid there's nothing available before noon . __eou__ How about 12:45 ? __eou__ Sorry , but he's busy then too . __eou__
Come in and sit down . __eou__ Thanks , Mr . Liang . __eou__ Among all the assistants , I think you're on top of it . Based on the annual evaluation , the board of directors decided to give you a bonus . __eou__ Really ? I am too happy . __eou__ I've been reviewing your work over the past few months . Thanks to your excellent work , we benefit much from your project . And you should get the perfect attendance award too . __eou__ Thanks for your trust . Owing to my colleagues ' help , I've successfully completed my task . __eou__ You are very modest and diligent . The distribution of bonus derived from the performance evaluation . You deserve it . __eou__ Thank you very much . I will redouble my efforts in the future . __eou__
Where did you study accounting ? __eou__ I studied at Anshan University . __eou__ Did you intern anywhere ? __eou__ Yes , I interned with an accounting firm during tax season . __eou__ That must have been stressful . __eou__ Yes , but I learned a lot . __eou__ I'll bet . __eou__ I learned about different tax laws and how they work . __eou__
Who has been here already this morning ? __eou__ Well , Vince dropped off some sales reports for you.Said you signed a big deal with HomeSupplies.com . __eou__ They're small fry . Tonight I'm going to LA to negotiate with Stars.com . That'll be big . __eou__ You're right . All the entertainment web sites follow Stars.com . __eou__ Who else has been here ? __eou__ Elvin stopped by to see me . __eou__ Elvin ? Which one is he ? __eou__
We'd better have a brief talk about the loading port . __eou__ We are always willing to choose the big ports as the loading ports . __eou__ What's your unloading port , please ? __eou__ As most of our clients are near Tianjin , we'd like to appoint Tangle as the unloading port . __eou__
Allan , I am really disappointed by your lack of effort on this project . __eou__ Look , Sally . I ’ Ve put just as much work into this as anybody else . __eou__ No , I ’ m sorry . I disagree . I don ’ t think you ’ Ve been working at full speed at all . __eou__ Well . I ’ m sorry you feel that way . __eou__
I want a suit of workmanship and suitable for formal meetings.Would you recommend some brands ? __eou__ How about these famous brands ? Such as pierre Cardin ... __eou__ I'm afraid that's a bit beyond my means . __eou__ Then you can try some local products.They ' re also of good quality . __eou__
You ’ re not going to believe what happened today . You ’ Ve got to promise to keep it to yourself . __eou__ Sure , what gives ? __eou__ Today Mr . Leo threw Sally out of class ! __eou__ On the level ? __eou__ I ’ ll say . I knew Sally would finally show her true colors . When she got her final test results back from Mr . Leo , she started yelling at him . You should have heard her . I ’ Ve never seen anyone get so upset before . To make a long story short , it seems that Mr . Leo failed her because he caught her cheating . __eou__ That ’ s no laughing matter . That means she ’ ll have to take the whole course again . I can ’ t believe she ’ s going to have to start from the beginning . __eou__ It serves her right ! __eou__
Who is your favorite music composer ? __eou__ I don't have one single favorite , but these days I listen to a lot of Chopin . __eou__ Then you must despise such modern music as rock ? __eou__ Without doubt , rock is trash . __eou__
Are you making what I think you're making ? __eou__ Nothing but the best , Cinnamon toast . __eou__ What a nostalgic food ! __eou__ Why the drama ? Have you been watching soap operas ? __eou__ No . Just the smell of bread toasting to a perfect golden brown ... __eou__ Brings back memories ? __eou__
The academy is an important part of the education system . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you more . __eou__
We'd like a half-day package . __eou__ We offer many different sea water treatments . __eou__ How many can we choose ? __eou__ The aquamedic pool is included . You can choose three . __eou__ We'll do the seaweed wrap , the jet bath , and the foot massage . __eou__ OK . Here are your robes . You can go shower first . __eou__
Peter really is a remarkable expert ! There is very little he doesn ’ t know . __eou__ I have exactly the same feeling . This afternoon he explained the ins and outs of the stock market to me . He knows a lot about investments . __eou__
Owl ! I've twisted my ankle . I slipped on that greasy patch over there . I don't think it's broken but it really hurts . __eou__ Sit down here - don't put any pressure on it . I'd better call the company doctor . __eou__
Have you had any publications ? __eou__ Yes . I have published some articles in China Daily and Economist . __eou__ How about your communication skills ? __eou__ As a journalist , I have strong communication skills . I am good at both discourse management and strategic competence . __eou__
Are there any vacancies still available ? __eou__ Yes . We need a plumber here . __eou__ I am looking for a job that is more advanced than that , such as sales manager or regional manager . __eou__ I am sorry . They are not available now . __eou__
But how did you know I was working for WebTracker ? __eou__ When I was in LA , I met the WebTracker sales rep . __eou__ He couldn't have told you . Only a few people at WebTracker know about me . __eou__ The sales rep had a green note pad just like yours . He said everybody at WebTracker used them . __eou__ I can't believe it . I can't believe I fell into your trap . __eou__ We both may be snakes , Dave , but I'm just better at it . Among the snakes , I'm the sneakiest . __eou__
At the Beijing Olympics , all four table tennis events were all-Chinese finals . A clean sweep again ! __eou__ Yes . All international ping-pong tournaments have become a demonstration of Chinese supremacy in the sport . __eou__ Do you know any secrets to China's success ? __eou__ In the first place , I think the whole nation is just fond of the game . It is well grounded with the mass . With huge numbers of people playing ping-pong , we can always spot a handful of potential world champions . __eou__ So , the national ping-pong team must be a highly competitive membership . __eou__ Sure . There is a careful mechanism for selecting players from provincial teams , and those lucky dogs have to observe strict rules . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ They are subject to hard training . And you know what , for a player on the national team , personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions . They are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other . __eou__ Oh , dear ! It's an encroachment on individual rights ! __eou__ Well , ping-pong is our national sport , and we just have to keep winning one honor after another . That's why many people think such rules acceptable . After all , they are funded out of taxpayers'money . __eou__
How are you feeling , Flora ? __eou__ Much better , thanks . I have been resting all day . Only with television as my companion.In fact , in the whole week the only thing I feel like doing was watching TV . __eou__ What did you watch today ? __eou__ I started with game show this morning , I really enjoy them , and even answered the most of questions correctly . __eou__ And next ? __eou__ At 2 o'clock , I switched to the Channel 6 , and watched a terrific movie without commercials . __eou__ I know what you mean , there wasn't old action movie next . I think you won't like it . __eou__ I want to watch it , but I was already tired by the time it came on . I had a rest instead , then I watched the news at Channel 11 . __eou__ Anything important happened ? __eou__ A bank was robbed this afternoon . A reporter on the scene covered the event , the live coverage reproduce the robbery to the live . __eou__
Can you tell me the differences between a letter and a memorandum , Miss Thong ? __eou__ Certainly . A letter must be sent out of the company and must be mailed or posted . A memorandum is a communication within an organization . __eou__ Should we use the layout we use for a letter when we write a memorandum ? __eou__ No , not necessary . Usually we have a set form which is printed . We just fill in the printed forms and send it to the person or the offices concerned in the company . __eou__ Of course , let me find one for you . __eou__
OK , folks , let's get to work . We need to come up with some ideas for the new essentials perfume campaign . This is a really big contract and we are under a lot of pressure here to impress the client . __eou__ Well , Let's get down to business ( shall we ? ) Now is probably a good time to start our discussion , the main purpose of this meeting is to talk about the benefits and disadvantages of our new project . __eou__ The reason I have called this meeting is to review a proposal we have received from our international division in Hong Kong . The agenda for this meeting is as follows , first , a presentation of the new proposal by Mr . Black . Second , an analysis by Ms . Nielson . Finally , a discussion about whether or not to implement this proposal . __eou__
Why are there so many people ? __eou__ It seems like a traffic accident . __eou__ Those people are quarrelling . __eou__
Are you still on your summer vacation ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ When will school start ? __eou__ It'll start on lst September . __eou__
I noticed your absence in class this morning . __eou__ I'm sorry , I overslept . __eou__
He has so many friends supporting him . __eou__ And he himself is very diligent . Considering all these , I think he has the ball at his feet . __eou__ But he has to stick to it and to it long enough . __eou__
Our house is too small . We had better have a big one . __eou__ How could we ever manage to buy a big house when we are always living beyond our means ? __eou__ Shut up . You should think how to make fortunes , not look for a squabble . __eou__
Hello , Mary . __eou__ Hello , Brian . __eou__ Here is my friend Bob . __eou__ Hello , Bob . __eou__
David , have you watched the 82nd Oscar Awards Ceremony ? Avatar got the Award of Visual Effect . The movie sounds great ! __eou__ You are so old-fashioned . I have already watched it last week in cinema . __eou__ How was it ? __eou__ Its 3D animation is attractive and its colorful scenes are also unforgettable . __eou__ It is said that The Hurt Locker got the Award of Best Picture . What do you think about this ? __eou__ Well , its theme is moving and profound , so from the academic aspect , this is its advantage to win the award . __eou__
How is Jim recently ? __eou__ He has lost his job , and his wife died from cancer not long before . __eou__ Poor guy ! It will take him a long time to get back on his feet . __eou__
He told the police that Ted was the murderer . __eou__ He is playing hob with the fact . __eou__ Why do you say so ? __eou__ Because he stayed with me all the time that night . __eou__
Do you know that Jack got divorced last month . __eou__ For what reason . __eou__ Jack always lives by his wits and he cannot support his family . __eou__ He had better make a change . __eou__
Trina , will you marry me ? __eou__ Yes ! Yes ! And yes ! Jared , of course I ’ ll marry you ! __eou__ Oh , Babe , I can ’ t wait to spend the rest of my life with you ! I can ’ t wait for all the adventures we ’ re going to have , for all the fights and the laughter . I can ’ t wait to grow old and wrinkly with you . __eou__ Oh , Jared ! I can ’ t wait for our wedding ! I hope you don ’ t mind , but I ’ Ve already chosen a date ! Six months from now in the summer ! Melissa saw you buying the ring last month so I ’ Ve had plenty of time to start planning ! __eou__ She what ? __eou__ Oh don ’ t worry , sweetie , I didn ’ t know when you were going to propose . It was still a nice surprise ! As I was saying , I ’ Ve got it all planned out . There ’ s almost nothing left to do ! I wrote up our guest list and we will have roughly four hundred guests attending . __eou__ Four hundred ? __eou__ No need to sweat it . My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding , which is going to be low-budget anyway . So roughly four hundred people , which means that the hall at Northwoods Heights will be our reception venue . I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents ’ church and my uncle of course would be officiating . We ’ ll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counseling . The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer . My step-sister and her string quartet will take care of that . My cousin will be the official photographer . I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo . Did you know that she ’ s going to be a professional opera singer ? __eou__ Ah ... __eou__ And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we ’ ll get the Youth Group to serve us . I was thinking that your friend ’ s band could be our entertainment for the night . though they might have to tone it down a bit . Or we could hire a DJ . Your sister ’ s husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings . what ’ s their name again ? I was thinking that we could have an island paradise-themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine . And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we ’ ll make our toasts ! What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors ? Who else am I missing ? Oh , your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake ! __eou__ Wow . __eou__ See ? It ’ s going to be wonderful ! Oh this wedding is going to be everything I ever dreamed of . __eou__ If I survive the next six months . __eou__
Is Water Shrinking Festival official ? __eou__ No , most of the traditional festivals of the minority nationalities are not official . __eou__ Don't you think these festivals are more interesting ! __eou__ What an idea ! __eou__
Titanic made a hit ! It was so touching . __eou__ But I see things rather differently.The heroin is not attractive and her acting is just so-so . __eou__ The heroin may not be attractive . I like the story , though . __eou__
Come on . All of us are waiting for you . __eou__ Oh , sorry . Cross my fingers . __eou__
There are so many Chinese people in Vancouver . __eou__ The Chinatown in Vancouver is the second largest Chinatown in the North America . __eou__
Uncle Ben , how did the Forbidden City get this name ? __eou__ Well , in the feudal society , emperors had supreme power , so his residence was certainly a forbidden palace . __eou__ His residence ? You mean the whole palace ? __eou__ Yes . The Forbidden City is divided into two parts . The southern section , or the Outer Court was for the emperor to exercise his power over the nation , and the northern part , or the Inner Court was for his royal family . __eou__ Oh , unbelievable . This was too luxurious . __eou__ Even the whole country belonged to him . That's why he is called the emperor . __eou__ OK , then . I love these unique structured towers with the delicate carvings on them . It's really artistic . __eou__ Yeah , the buildings and designs of the Forbidden City are the peak of Chinese traditional architecture , not only scientific but also suitable for living . __eou__ I agree . It's definitely a product of wisdom . Well , why were those small animal sculptures placed on the tops of the buildings ? __eou__ Some of them are mascots and some are symbols of power . __eou__ Why are there so many yellow things ? Is yellow the lucky color in China ? __eou__ Oh , no . In fact , yellow is the symbol of the royal family . __eou__ Just like the pattern dragon , right ? __eou__ Exactly . Here is the Nine-dragon Screen . __eou__ Oh , it's really fabulous . I wanna take a picture here . __eou__ Sure , this will be a really good picture . __eou__
Quality is very important to us . We work to very low tolerance levels . We need to have guaranteed supplies of consistently high quality raw materials . Over the years we've built up very good relationships with our suppliers . __eou__ Do you have many different suppliers ? __eou__ Yes . There are about fifty names on our approved supplier list , but for raw materials we tend to deal with three local companies . __eou__
This is the schedule for the project . Any comments or questions ? __eou__ I think we'll need more time than the schedule gives us . __eou__ Don't worry . These dates are only targets . __eou__
That price of ours , by the way , is for a minimum quantity of 1,000 saddles . __eou__ Yes , I noticed that . To what extent would local assembly help sales , did you say ? __eou__ 20-30 % . But we proposed the plan from the storage and delivery viewpoint . That is to say , less warehouse space and prompt delivery . __eou__ Yes , of course . Assembly would be quite a simple matter . Cycle dealers could put them together in a very short time . __eou__ Sales have been exceptionally good during the past twelve months . __eou__ Yes , I've noticed that . Where have you been placing them ? __eou__ All in the local market . One or two suggestions that came in from the distribution might interest you . __eou__ Yes . What were they ? Anything that will help sales ? __eou__ Perhaps . General opinion is that the rear carrier should be offered as an extra . __eou__ That's to keep the price down , I suppose . I'll take it up with our overseas department and listen to what they've got to say about this . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
Ange , can your dog do any tricks yet ? __eou__ Oh , yeah ! He can sit down , roll over , and even play dead . __eou__ Really ? Does he chase balls ? __eou__ Yup.Hey , do you want to see a picture ? See , he's eating lunch . __eou__ This can't be the same dog . He's so clean , he shines . __eou__ See , he's wagging his tail . __eou__ He's really cute . His bowl even has his name on it . __eou__
Did Bean send these dirty jokes to you , too ? Look ! __eou__ What a creep ! Phony good luck e-mails are one thing , but sexual harassment is crossing the line . __eou__ No wonder he asked for my address first-he just wants to harass me ! __eou__ You could try using a spam filter to reject stuff that's obviously pornographic or anything else you don't want . __eou__
This is my house.Let me show you around it . __eou__ How beautiful the detached house is ! __eou__ Follow me to the back-yard . __eou__ It's marvelous ! The lawn looks like a green carpet , and the garden with so many lovely flowers . __eou__ We had the grass cut and the flowers trimmed this morning . __eou__ No wonder it smells fragrant . __eou__ Here is the swimming pool and we can swim later . __eou__ It's fantastic ! __eou__
Hey , May . How about getting together for a movie tonight ? __eou__ Sure . What's playing ? __eou__ Well , Let me check the newspaper . What about The Terminal ? __eou__ Wow , it stars Catherine Zeta-Jones , my favorite actress . __eou__ Well , birds of a feather flock together . I like her too . She was in a lot of dramas . __eou__ She is so beautiful and elegant . And she is famous for her fine acting . __eou__ What's more , she doesn't have scandals . And she likes to take part in the charitable activities . __eou__ Who is the director ? __eou__ Steven Spielberg . Another superstar . __eou__ Yes , a legend , also . I still remember , his movies , Jurassic Park and Schindler's List got him nine Oscar awards in 1994 . __eou__ Can you introduce the story of The Terminal briefly ? __eou__ It tells a romantic and humorous love story . __eou__ This is really exciting movie . Lets go to this one . __eou__
You look pale today . __eou__ I didn't wear make-up this morning . __eou__ You should do sports to keep young . __eou__ You're right.Make - up can only disguise my age , but exercise may delay it . __eou__
Okay . This trail looks the best . It's a little steep . But I'm sure it will be alright . __eou__ Well . You're the tour guide , I'll follow you . __eou__ ... What a stink . This place stinks like rotten eggs . __eou__ That's sulphur you can smell . The whole of Taiwan is a volcanic region . That's why Taiwan has so many hot springs . It's volcanic activity.The sulfur smoke that you can smell is coming from those fumaroles over there . __eou__ Suddenly the ' great outdoors ' isn't so appealing . Let's hike a little faster ... __eou__
Oh , this is Monica __eou__ OK . Commodity inspection is really an important part of our trade contract . __eou__ Yes . Let's first define the inspection right . __eou__ Following the rules of world business , the exporters have the right to inspect the goods before the delivery , while the importers have the right to re-inspect the goods after their arrival . __eou__ Would you tell me how the inspection is conducted before shipment and by which agency ? __eou__ Inspection is to be done by the China Commodity Inspection and Testing Bureau . Usually inspection is conducted within five days before each shipment . __eou__ And can you tell me about the re-inspection ? __eou__ Yes . The re-inspection should be made within seven days upon the arrival , and if any discrepancy is found , the claim must be raised within one month . __eou__ I see . How do they make testing and analysis of this item ? __eou__ They always use the standard and method laid down in the contract . __eou__ What if the results from the two inspections do not coincide with each other ? __eou__ A seminar of technical specialists including the surveyors from both sides will be held to clarify which result is correct . __eou__
It sounds like Bob's getting out of bed . __eou__ What time did he come in last night ? __eou__ It was after 2 am . __eou__ Who was he out with ? __eou__
What courses did you take in college ? __eou__ I took a lot of courses , such as Philosophy , Logic , Ethics , Aesthetics , etc . __eou__ Which course did you like best ? __eou__ I liked Aesthetics best . It is very impressive . __eou__
I hope the teacher decides to curve our test grades . __eou__ I wouldn't count on it . __eou__ She did last time . __eou__ Yes , but I'll bet she won't again . __eou__
Look , my clothes are wet . __eou__ Mine are wet , too . __eou__ Unexpectedly , a girl threw a bucket of water on me . __eou__ She wished good luck to you . __eou__ The Dai people are enthusiastic . __eou__ Yes . __eou__
Every country should face the history . __eou__ Yeah , we don ’ t live in the vacuum . We have traditional values and long but different history . __eou__ Sometimes , we , human beings , really had done something wrong , so we should admit it at first . __eou__ But there is always somebody who wants to turn his back on the true history . __eou__ I believe such things won ’ t be realized , just daydreaming . __eou__
Where do you have to go . __eou__ To New York . __eou__ When do you have to be there . __eou__ Tomorrow morning . __eou__ How long do you have to be there ? __eou__ Three days . __eou__ When will you be back ? __eou__ On Friday . __eou__
I want to offer you more invoking stock options . __eou__ When you hired me , you knew you were going to be low on cash , didn't you ? __eou__ Let me explain . To get more cash , I'll have to borrow more from Vital , the venture capitalists . __eou__ I know how it works . You don't want to give away any more of your future profits than you have to . __eou__ Exactly . Instead of increasing their position , I want to increase yours . __eou__
In order to extend our export business to your country , we wish to enter into direct business relations with you . __eou__ It's our pleasure . __eou__ Our hope is to establish mutual beneficial trading relations between us . __eou__
There are thousands of magazines published in the world to meet the needs of different readers . But only a few of them are influential world-wide . __eou__ You have hit the point . It's really hard for a magazine to be well known to people of various ages and educational backgrounds . __eou__ But I think Digest is supposed to be the top one . Its subscribers or buyers are from all social classes , perhaps , a majority of them from the educated group . It's quite strange that the readers love it after reading it . __eou__ To my mind , the success of Digest is in the clever selection of its articles in each issue . __eou__
I'm planning to buy a bicycle . As you are quite a cycling enthusiast , I wish you might give me some advice . __eou__ With pleasure , chap . But before I start , I need to know what you want a bike for ? __eou__ My purposes are two-fold . On the one hand , I've grown bored of commuting on suffocating buses every day and decided to ride to work . On the other hand , bicycling is a sport , and I intend to build up my body through constantly taking a ride over the weekends . __eou__ Cycling during weekends ? Do you me riding on the mountainous countryside just the neighboring towns ? __eou__ Does that make any difference ? __eou__ Can't be greater . If you ride on bumpy , hilly roads , a mountain bike is what you need . But if you just ride comfortably along the city lanes , you might choose a road bike . __eou__ Are they designed differently ? __eou__ A road bike features skinny tires and a light-weight frame . Its riding position puts you bent over the handlebars . It's not particularly beefy in construction , and generally , it won't stand up well under heavy loads or on really rough surfaces . In contrast , mountain bikes have wide tires and a stout frame . You sit higher on them and don't have to hunched over . __eou__
Now people are talking about world recession which started more than a year ago . Can you give us your personal assessment of the situation of the global economy ? __eou__ As you know , we are in a very special time . This is a very hard time for many countries ' economics , both developed and developing . I think the current economic situation could be described as synchronized slowdown of major economies . __eou__ What is the direct impact of the terrorist attack upon your country's economy ? __eou__ Once the US economy is in trouble due to the terrorist attack , the impact could be quickly felt in the rest of the world . __eou__ What challenges is your country's economy facing at the moment ? __eou__ We do face a lot of challenges because there is still much uncertainty about the world economy . It's very important for us to strike a proper balance between investment in fixed assets and household consumption . __eou__
The consignments of chemical instruments have just reached us . We have to lodge a claim against you for inferior quality I am afraid . __eou__ Is there anything wrong ? __eou__ We bought 1,000 sets of chemical instruments from you , but there are 40 not up to the standard . __eou__ It's hard for us to believe it . Our instruments have been the best quality for years . Have you any reliable evidence ? __eou__ Here is the survey report from a well-known public surveyor in London . You may inspect the defective instruments personally __eou__ Well . According to the contract , we are responsible for repairing or replacing those defective instruments . We ’ ll send our technicians to repair them . __eou__ Forty faulty instruments means that 4 % are not up to the standard . You should compensate us for 4 % of the total account on the contract , as well as for the inspection fee . __eou__ I am sorry about the quality problem , but I propose we compensate you for 3 % of the total value apart from the inspection fee . __eou__ All right . In that case we are still willing to do business with you . __eou__
The new year is coming . Is the final examination approaching . __eou__ Oh , yeah . We will have winter holiday . __eou__ How are you getting along with your studies ? __eou__ Don ’ t worry , mum . I will study hard tomorrow . __eou__ But your were playing video games all afternoon . You are skating on thin ice . __eou__
The results of the poll show Bill Clinton's approval rating has gone up in his second term . Do you find that interesting ? __eou__ Well , I think Clinton deserves high marks for doing his job generally , but he may get low marks for his honesty and personal image . __eou__ That is exactly what the poll shows . Although the stating of Clinton as a person has gone down in the last two years of his term , his approval rating is as high as 66 percent . __eou__ I don't find this surprising . The poll data sound quite right . He is a good president . __eou__ But the poll says only 15 percent say he will be remembered as an outstanding president . __eou__
Mrs . Smith , you are always worried about your children . __eou__ They are my own flesh and blood . It ’ s hard for me to see them suffering . __eou__ That ’ s human nature . __eou__
How I wish my son Mark could be as excellent as your Joe ! __eou__ Don ’ t be too humble . Few young men could be equal to Mark . And in some respects Joe and Mark are neck and neck . __eou__ I agree . Both Joe and Mark are men of guts . __eou__
Mom , is there anything in the fridge I can eat before dinner ? __eou__ There's some leftover pizza from last night . __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ Um , I think there may be some leftover lasagna from the other day . __eou__ Do I have any other choices ? __eou__ There might be some birthday cake left in the freezer . __eou__ Is everything in the fridge leftovers ? I hate leftovers ! __eou__ You can wash the vegetables and cut the chicken and I'll make dinner ! __eou__
You are an early bird , Tom . What do you do in the morning then ? __eou__ Exercise . The morning hours are the most precious period within a single day . We should not pass them up easily . Seize the time and do something useful . __eou__ So , you choose to spend it on bodybuilding . Where do you exercise ? __eou__ Usually , I run to the Black Bamboo Park as a warm-up . Admission is free . Then I start my activities . __eou__ Do you do the same exercises every day ? __eou__ No , I've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars , push-ups , sit-ups , bunny-hops , five-kilometer run , and so on . I alternate them over the weekdays . Sometimes , when I find myself in a bad state , I will simply idle about in the park . __eou__ Why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ? __eou__ It's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . I fear that if I fail to get up early one day , I may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . Besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . Here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . It's interesting to join them . __eou__ Oh , yes . Singing is also a good way of keeping fit , at least mentally . __eou__
Hi ! It's still seven o'clock . Are you crazy ? __eou__ I got the information that there is a killer sale at the shopping mall near our block . Get up and I will wait for you at the gate of our flat . __eou__ Every time when you glimpse some stylish clothes , you change into another person . __eou__ Stop complaining , OK ? __eou__ No wonder you are named shopaholic . __eou__ No , I am not a shopaholic , but a super shopaholic . And I really enjoy smelling the gorgeous clothes and new bags . __eou__ Wait a moment . And you can check where other sales are . __eou__
It ’ s a wonderful party , Joan , The food , the drink , the atmosphere ... Everyone is enjoying himself . __eou__ Thanks to your help.To our friendship . __eou__ Bottoms up ! By the way what kind of entertainment are we gonna have ? __eou__ Dancing . The boys from the Campus Band have promised to play music for us . __eou__ Oh , how wonderful ! Every girl on the campus has a crush on those handsome guys . __eou__ I'll surely make introductions for them . __eou__
Hi , Zina . Lots of people are looking for you . __eou__ Like who ? __eou__ Like Elvin . He isn't too happy about what you promised Stars.com . __eou__ I've got it under control . __eou__ You do realize that it isn't humanly possible for us to finish by next week ? __eou__ What if you had three more top-notch programmers to help you ? __eou__ That would definitely make a difference . But Vince already said no . __eou__
What can I do for you ? __eou__ Hello , there . I've just started using your net banking and I'm looking for some information about my Commission Fund . __eou__ I see .

With our Net Banking , anything is possible ! __eou__
Pretty ! Say beautiful rather . Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than she altogether-face and figure ? __eou__ I do not know what I could imagine , but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers . __eou__ Such an eye ! The true hazel eye-and so brilliant ! Regular features , open countenance , with a complexion , Oh ! What a bloom of full health , and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure ! There is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance . One hears sometimes of a child being ' the picture of health ' ; now , she always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health . She is loveliness itself . __eou__
Millions of amateur investors like you , have to rely on a dizzying array of financial newspapers , magazines and commentators to get investment information . __eou__ Yes.It ' s sometimes scary if you think of the tremendous amount of media we face every day . __eou__ It's like information overload , not to mention the reliability of these papers and magazines . __eou__ Which financial magazines and newspapers do you think do the best job of checking facts ? __eou__ Well , for example , The Wall Street Journal is very , very good . Even though it's used on occasion ( as all news organizations are ) by Ces or bankers who leak their mergers in advance in order to get a positive spin . __eou__ I like to read Fortune . __eou__ Good . Fortune is usually ahead of the curve.And Business Week is very solid , too . __eou__ Where does a broadcast company get most of their information ? I hope it's not just from press releases . __eou__ A good broadcast company usually does far more than press releases.Their people go out and do real reporting , talking to people at the stock exchange , fund managers , analysts , etc . __eou__ But sometimes when a flimsy report , or even a rumor gets on television , there's going to be a terrible ' echo chamber ' effect . __eou__ You are right about that . __eou__
I need your help , Bob . __eou__ What's the matter ? __eou__ I'm really confused by these annoying abbreviations . __eou__ Just relax . That's because you're new to chat . Let me take a look . __eou__ A / S / L , IGP , H & K , and ZZZ . What the hell do they mean ? __eou__ ZZZ means'sleepy or tired or bored ' , A / S / L is tricky , which is often used at first encounter . It's a three-word question , ' age , / sex / location ? ' __eou__ Interesting . Then what does H & K refer to ? The city of Hong Kong ? __eou__ Wrong . lt's not a place name , but a passionate act . __eou__ Really ? What kind ? A girl left this word to me , and I thought she was in Hong Kong . __eou__ Ahahah ... you miss her point for sure . H & K actually is an acronym for ' hug and kiss ' . __eou__ Hug and kiss ? ! How is it possible ? Oh , it's really bad to Miun - Verstand her meaning . __eou__ Yeah , seems that you have a lot to learn and memorize . __eou__

I plan to say a few words about the current situation in the Middle East and how it affects world economy . I'd like to give you an overview of the way that the economies of seemingly unrelated countries are intertwined . I've divided my talk into three parts , first an overview of international relations , second a discussion of current political situations , and lastly trends for the future . My presentation will take about two hours , but there will be a twenty-minute break in the middle . We'll stop for lunch at 12 . __eou__

That's simple enough . __eou__ Always print clearly , and fill in the bubbles completely . __eou__

Are these your text books ? Biochemistry , General Ecology , Botany , Cell Genetics , Molecular Genetics ... __eou__ Yes . I gotta review all of them for the final exam . It is just around the corner . __eou__ Oh , right ! Do you have many exams at the end of each semester ? __eou__ That depends . Some semesters have many , some don't . And some courses don't have exams but only ask for papers . That's easy . __eou__ And when do you prepare for your final exam ? __eou__ Honestly speaking , most students prepare it one month before the exam . __eou__ Really ? You only review your lessons in one month ? Does it work ? __eou__ Of course , it's useful . And it's very crucial to have the copies of teacher's notes , because most questions in the exam are based on them . __eou__ Wow , and all the key points are included in them ? You're so smart ! __eou__ But the exam is not as simple as you may imagine . We have to stay up late . __eou__ Do you have the classrooms open for the whole night ? __eou__ Yes , some people even pack up his bed quilt and sleep there . That's a little bit crazy . __eou__

What's the news on our website ? How effective do you think it is from a marketing standpoint ? __eou__ We've been able to survey and track some of the information of our website users through some cookie technology , and it's surprising to see the results . __eou__ What kinds of hits are we getting on our company's website ? __eou__ From the numbers , it seems nearly half of the visitors who stumble onto our page pick up the link not from network browsers or search engines , but from our circular insert . That means our consumers are purposefully and actively seeking information about our products and services through the web format . Based on these findings , I am completely convinced the internet is the marketing power of the future ! __eou__ You really think that many people turn to the internet to find product information.What about the old standbys of word mouth and print media ? __eou__ Well , these mediums are still important ... they aren't a thing of the past ... But I think they might be less important now than in the past . The technology age has arrived ! __eou__

Your resume mentioned that you had been the surveyor , which was a concurrent job , of a certain market survey company . What was your main work content ? __eou__ My main duties include designing survey sheets , transferring them to the dispatchers , making telephone covering on blurred information and processing the data and doing the primary analysis . __eou__ What had you gained mainly from this survey activity ? __eou__ First , it was how to design survey sheets according to the subjects , because we had to prevent the questions from being too influential and we must make sure that every question was balanced and equitable . Secondly , it was how to get information through telephone covering in the fastest and most effectively way , because the person doing the survey usually doesn ’ t have the patience to wait for long feedback . So the way we put up questions must be clear and direct and only by this means can we get accurate data . __eou__
What's combined transportation ? __eou__ If the goods are to be transshipped from one means of transportation to another during the course of the entire voyage , it's called ' combined transportation ' . __eou__ Why is it necessary ? __eou__ It's simpler and cheaper to arrange multi-model combined transportation . __eou__

How did your company's fundraiser go ? __eou__ The fundraiser events went really well . We were able to partner with a few of our competitors , all in fun of course , to sponsor a marathon for the American Cancer Society . All of the people who participated it had a great time , and we were able to raise a lot of money to contribute to cancer research . __eou__ So how does it work ? How were you able to make money with the marathon ? __eou__ Each of the runners that participated the marathon race paid a ten dollar entrance fee . Also , they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran . All in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars . __eou__ Sounds like a great deal for the American Cancer Society . __eou__ In all honesty , it's also a great deal for our company . The exposure that we gained from sponsoring an invent like this was great for our image in the community . We accomplished as much as last year's advertising campaign , plus we were able to do a little fundraising for a good cause . __eou__
How much do you pay wholesale for your products ? __eou__ We have a few different wholesale vendors , so our cost varies a bit over the fiscal year . But the difference is miniscule , a fluctuation of about 0.2 % . __eou__ That must impact your bottom line at least a little bit , doesn't it ? After all , your sticker price is pretty much set in stone . How much do they go for retail ? __eou__ Retail price is 29.95 per unit . We take into consideration changes in supply cost when figuring this price . __eou__ Is that including tax ? __eou__ No , that's the price before tax . The tax rate is varies from different marketing areas , so it is difficult for us to figure in . __eou__ How much is your profit margin then ? __eou__ Our profit margin is in the neighborhood of 20 % . __eou__
Do you know who Ammo Hung is ? __eou__ Of course . He is now 50 years old .

He has also become an independent producer and director . __eou__ You know only one aspect of him . Do you know what he would do in the kitchen ? __eou__ I have no idea . Tell me . __eou__ In the kitchen , with his wife by his side he still puts on quite a dinner time show . __eou__ What does he do there ? __eou__ Imagine a chef chopping vegetables on fast forward . Picture a man making a stir-fry , tossing the mixture up in the air , and then catching it , every last bit , in his work . And his culinary motto is ' Enjoy the moment . ' If you want to know hey theycook , visit www.StudioClassroom.com.tw for the recipe . __eou__
The new webpage design is much more effective than before . I feel confident it will rope in a lot more business because of its user-friendly format . __eou__ Why do you think the new page is so much better than the old page ? I thought the old page wasn't half bad ... __eou__ The old page was okay , alright , but there wasn't a big influence in our sales volume , because the site wasn't developed with an eye towards the marketing aspect . Now it's different . We got our marketing department team in on the action , and the results are smashing ... __eou__ What changes were made from the old page to the new page ? __eou__ First , the visitors to the site are encouraged to give their contact information . They can sign up for a free monthly drawing . Once we've got their info , it goes into a database for future marketing mailers and advertising targeting . Also , there are clear links to descriptions of our products and services , so as to give confidence to new customers . We also added a specific area for on-line customer service ... So far we've gotten a ton of positive feedback ... __eou__ Great ! __eou__
The product's selling points is its advanced technoledge . __eou__ Unfortunately , it's just too expensive for majority of consumer to afford . __eou__ Why is the price so high ? __eou__ It's not just that the price is high , it's that the overhead to update an entire computer system to be compatible is costly . __eou__ Model of computers aren't compatible ? __eou__ Most current computer systems simply can't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities . __eou__ Maybe after the next generation of technology comes out , the price of this model will become more affordable . __eou__ But by then , the technology will be outdated . __eou__ True , but our focus has never been affordability anyway . Coastwise , we may not be very competitive , but qualitywise , we definitely have an edge . __eou__ That's right , no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable . __eou__ This model has advanced technoledge , superior components , it is compact , and it's a top-quality product . __eou__ I guess you get what you pay for . __eou__
I can't believe my eyes , Bill . Are you having a salad for lunch ? No hamburger ? __eou__ Get used to it , Mary . I'm off hamburgers for good health . Most fast food is loaded with sodium . __eou__ I know . But why are you suddenly interested in lessening your salt intake ? __eou__ My doctor says I should cut back on sodium-rich foods to lower my blood pressure . __eou__ Do you have hypertension ? I would have thought you were too young . __eou__ Actually , my blood pressure isn't that high yet , but they say it increases with age . __eou__ Well , I'm glad you're starting to pay more attention to your diet . __eou__ I want to lower my risk of heart attack and stroke , too . __eou__ So do I . That's why I've been trying to lower my cholesterol level . __eou__ I've noticed you've been munching away on lots of fruits and vegetables recently . __eou__ That's right . I could stand to lose a few pounds , too . __eou__
I'm done . Can I watch TV ? __eou__ Here's some water . Take these multi-vitamins and Tylenol . __eou__ Uh ! I can't swallow them , Mom ! __eou__ Your throat must be swollen . __eou__ Do I have to take them ? __eou__ Here , I'll break them up , so they're smaller . And here's some cough syrup . __eou__ Yuck ! __eou__ I know , it tastes horrible . But it'll make you feel better . Try holding your nose . It won't taste as bad . __eou__
New York Airport.May I help you ? __eou__ Yes . I am calling to make sure if flight CG877 will arrive on time ? __eou__ Hold on a moment please ... Sorry , the flight from London has been delayed . It departed two hours later than scheduled.The whether in London was really bad . __eou__ You mean it will arrive two hours later than usual ? __eou__ So far we could only deduce this way.If you want further information , would you please call us 1 hour later ? __eou__ OK , thank you . __eou__
Hello , jewelry department . How may I help you ? __eou__ It's me , Ali . There's this strange guy who keeps coming around . He's been here three times this week . __eou__ He's probably a pervert . Just ignore him . __eou__ He makes me nervous . He looks at me funny . And he never buys anything ! __eou__ Maybe he wants to get something for his girlfriend , but he's embarrassed . __eou__
That is the most boring , typical gift in the world ! __eou__ I know . But this year I want to get him an interesting tie . Like this one . __eou__ That's not exactly a conversation piece . It's so plain . __eou__ It's perfect ! It's a Dilbert tie ! __eou__ The diagonal black and red stripes are really conservative though ... __eou__ But watch this ... it bends upwards , just like Dilbert's tie . There's a wire inside . __eou__ A fly-away tie ! What a riot ! __eou__
Mmm . Nice and crunchy . And they leave a space uncovered for you to hold ... __eou__ They're so much fun to eat . You can suck all the coating off first ... __eou__ Or just stuff the whole thing in your mouth at once ! __eou__ But that way you're not savoring it . __eou__ Whatever . Give me another pack . __eou__ Hey ! The movie hasn't even started and they're almost gone ! __eou__
I used to be down on the sales people until I saw her in action . __eou__ She means business , for sure . __eou__ Most salespeople seem like half-brains . Zina's definitely an exception . __eou__ We'd better get back to work . __eou__ Yeah , I'm not too worried about Vince , but I'd hate to face Zina if we don't deliver ... __eou__
Balista , pull me a ristretto . __eou__ What ? You're suddenly some kind of coffee snob now ? What's a ristretto anyway ? __eou__ It's basically a very strong espresso . Half the water pulled through the same amount of beans . Pure coffee essence . __eou__ Sounds like it must be just full of caffeine . I want one of those instead ! __eou__ You fiend . It's about the flavor , not the fix . Why don't you just crush some caffeine pills and start doing lines ? __eou__
Did you see the way that Brian came to work yesterday ? Ever since he came back from that conference in Silicon Valley , he's been coming to work dressed in jeans and sweatshirts . It's like he's decided to make himself at home in his office . I don't know how long it'll take before the management talks to him about it . __eou__ He was really influenced by the way they do things on the west coast . I guess the working atmosphere is a lot more relaxed and casual in California . It comes from the information technology industry .. there isn't such a large division between home and office , so people want to work in the clothes they feel more relaxed in . __eou__ Maybe so , but it seems kind of strange , which the rest of us in white shirts , dark suites , and ties . __eou__ It's not as bad as that ... We are allowed to wear more casual jackets and trousers . Besides , didn't you hear what Brian found on his desk this morning ? __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ Management decided to give him four brand new white shirts . That's their way of telling him that his new style of dressing down is not quite acceptable . __eou__
Did you see Victor on Wednesday , Wendy ? __eou__ Yes . We went for a walk in the woods near the highway . __eou__ Wasn ’ t it cold on Wednesday ? __eou__ Yes . It was very cold and windy . We wore heavy wool sweaters and walked quickly to keep warm . __eou__ It ’ s so nice and quiet in the woods . __eou__ Yes . Farther away from the highway it was very quiet and there were birds and squirrels everywhere . We counted over twenty squirrels . __eou__ It sounds wonderful . Did you take lunch with you ? __eou__ Yes , we bought veal sandwiches . We stopped around twelve , and we ate and watched the squirrels , but it was too windy to sit long . It was a very nice walk , anyway . __eou__
Tell me about yourself . __eou__ I was born and raised in Beijing . I attended Peking University and received my bachelor's degree in Economics . I have worked for 2 years as a financial consultant in Beijing for China Pacific Insurance Co . Ltd . __eou__ What type of position are you looking for ? __eou__ I'm looking for a position in which I can utilize my experience . __eou__ Are you interested in a full-time or part-time position ? __eou__ I am more interested in a full-time position . However , I would also consider a part-time position . __eou__ Can you tell me about your responsibilities at your last job ? __eou__ I advised customers on financial matters . After I consulted the customer , I completed a customer inquiry form and catalogued the information in our database . I then collaborated with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client . The clients were then presented with a summarized report on their financial activities that I formulated on a quarterly basis . __eou__ What is your greatest strength ? __eou__ I am an excellent communicator . People trust me and come to me for advice . One afternoon , my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . I made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together . __eou__ What is your greatest weakness ? __eou__ I tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied . However , I began setting time-limits for myself . __eou__ Why do you want to work for our company ? __eou__ After following your firm's progress for the last 3 years , I am convinced that your company is becoming one of the market leaders and I would like to be a part of that team . __eou__ When can you begin ? __eou__ Immediately . __eou__
I hate computer games . __eou__ Why ? They are fine . __eou__ Because they are too violent . Some of them are even disgusting . __eou__ Indeed there are bad games . But many of them are good . __eou__ If boys grow up with computer games , they will surely become bad . __eou__ Come on . Things are not so bad . Boys can learn to use the computer through games . __eou__
Did you hear the news ? Two of our major suppliers , Murphy Music and U-Tunes are merging ! If they are conglomerated into one company into one company , it would have some serious affects on our market strategy . __eou__ Are you sure ? Who told you that ? I highly doubt that they would take the step to merge into one company ... They're supposed to be bitter enemies , the strictest of competitors.It must be a rumor.It can't be true . __eou__ I read it myself on the financial page.They ' re really going to join together . U-Tunes was bought out by Murphy's , they will take over the company as of next month . __eou__ The competition must have been too stiff for U-Tunes.Otherwise why would they allow themselves to be taken over by their sworn enemy ? __eou__ I guess they must have figured it would be easier to merge than to keep up the cutthroat competition.If you can't beat'em , join'em . __eou__
What shall we do when we find a shortage in the shipment ? __eou__ You should do one of the two things - either to lodge a claim with the shipowner or with the insurance company . __eou__ Shall we leave it to the brokers ? __eou__ Yes . They usually do it . __eou__ Do they charge for that ? __eou__ Of course . In Europe , they charge a commission of 1 % of the amount of the claim for their service . __eou__ Is it the same in America ? __eou__ They do the work without charge to the importer . __eou__ It's part of their service , isn't it ? __eou__ Exactly . __eou__ Is it enough to claim with an on board bill of lading ? __eou__ No , you must also obtain a statement from the shipping agent certifying that the goods were actually loaded on their vessel for shipment . __eou__ I see . By the way , how do we prove the ownership of our goods ? __eou__ You must provide full original set of ocean bills of lading original insurance policy or certificate and the original commercia invoice . __eou__ I see . Thank you . __eou__ You are welcome . __eou__
Which of the steps are you focusing on in brandgrowth Awareness , understanding , acceptance , or loyalty ? __eou__ We're working on different steps in different areas.For example , our Colbert line is thriving in American markets , we've already reached the loyalty stage.In Asia , however , it's a different story.Most people haven't even heard of Colbert , so we're working on awareness through a lot of product launches and related activities . __eou__ What are you doing to increase understanding in the European sector ? __eou__ Understanding comes from product differentiation.We get that through product demonstration , literature , expert testimonials , and the like . __eou__
Hey , Doug ! How ’ d it go at that meeting yesterday ? I know you were pretty anxious about it . __eou__ Fantastic ! I got the promotion ! __eou__ Great ! When do you take over ? __eou__ After the new year . __eou__
Our current apartment is valued at RIB 700,000 . We can sell it and put that money towards buying the new apartment . __eou__ Yeah , but we still need RIB 500,000 . Maybe we can use some of our savings to pay part of it . __eou__ And we can take out a loan to pay the rest . __eou__ Great , so we can afford the new apartment after all ! __eou__ Uh huh ... but we're going to have to cut back on our shopping from now on . __eou__
Where ’ s Sally , Jack ? __eou__ She ’ s in the garden , Jane . __eou__ What ’ s she doing ? __eou__ She ’ s sitting under the tree . __eou__ Is Tim in the garden , too ? __eou__ Yes , he is .

It ’ s running across the grass . It ’ s running after a cat . __eou__

Let's go have a look . __eou__ OK , let's go . __eou__ The competition will begin in 5 minutes , it's tense here . __eou__ Wonderful , Bruce is taking the lead . __eou__ Other competitors have almost caught up with him . They are neck and neck . __eou__ Come on , Bruce . Come on , Bruce . __eou__ Wow , Bruce crossed the line first . __eou__
All the routine work really browns me off . __eou__ Oh , come on.You ' Ve just started . __eou__ I wish I hadn't chosen this job . __eou__
We cannot avoid being asked questions in the interview . Sometimes , my mind goes blank . __eou__ It is so terrible to be caught unaware . __eou__ Admittedly , you can get prepared in advance for the interview , but you cannot cover everything concerned . __eou__ Sure . So you should know how to deal with the probable questions and then make flexible reply . __eou__ Firstly , your answer should go straight to the point , and be clear and brief . __eou__ State your opinion or argument first , and then go on with details . __eou__ Never should you give an answer completely beside the point . __eou__ If you indeed don't know how to answer , admit it frankly . __eou__ Pretending to know when you do not know may expose yourself to ridicule . __eou__ Confirm the question if you don't catch it clearly . __eou__ Try to avoid the possible duplicate answer if you can . __eou__ It can help you leave a deep impression on the interviewer . __eou__
Jane ! What an enchanting skirt you have on ! __eou__ Thank you ! Guess how much it costs . __eou__ Bright colors , smooth material , exquisite craftsmanship , soft lines ... Darling , it looks elegant on you ! It can't be any cheap stuff . Something around two hundred , I guess . __eou__ Your offer is way off the mark . It set me back only sixty-five . __eou__ Then you got a windfall ! Was sixty-five the original price , or did you get a special discount ? __eou__ Neither . I drove a hard bargain with the vendor before I got the price down . __eou__ How much did she ask for ? __eou__ Three hundred ! That's daylight robbery . How dare she play tricks on an old hand like me ? Without hesitation , I gave my offer---no more than fifty . __eou__ She must be fuming with anger at such a bid , wasn't she ? __eou__ Not at all ! She's really been around , and seemed quite accustomed to bargaining like this . That's the trade . She only demanded a higher bid , saying the purchase price was even higher than seventy . She was lying ! Then I inquired , ' May I have it at sixty ? ' she waved her head . __eou__ Then you pretended to go without buying it ? __eou__ Yeah . I turned around and started to move out . Just then , she yelped behind my back , ' all right , all right ! I may sacrifice a little . Let's fix it sixty-five ! Can't be cheaper . ' __eou__
My god , it's such a lovely lake ! The lake has a water surface of 56 square kilometers . __eou__ No wonder it looks so huge . __eou__ We are now walking on what is in fact an island . Here we get one of the 10 sceneries of the West Lake , Autumn Moon over the Calm Lake . __eou__ Why is it called Autumn Moon over the Calm Lake ? __eou__ It's so named because in the pavilion over there the great poet Bai Buyi of the Tang Dynasty would take a rest after drinking a little too much , and watch the moon over the lake . __eou__ Very romantic . __eou__ Now let's board the boat and have a ride on the lake . __eou__ Sure ( They get on the boat ) . __eou__ Wang , what's that building over there ? It looks like some sort of a huge pavilion . __eou__ You are right . That's the Heart of Lake Pavilion , situated on an islet.It was built in 1552 and is the largest pavilion on the West Lake . Oh , here we are at the Little Yingzhou island . Let's get off the boat . Please watch your steps . __eou__

Who stands out in your mind as a man or woman of sound character ? __eou__ If I think of famous people , I think of Abraham Lincoln . __eou__ He's the US president , who walked five miles just to give a lady her change , isn't he ? __eou__ That's the one . He also was famous for never giving up on his goals . __eou__ That's right . He ran for office quite a few times before he was finally elected . __eou__ And I also admire him for his courage in fighting for equal rights . __eou__ He had great vision , didn't he ? __eou__ And humility .

Oh Gush ! The first day of my career is over . I can not breathe now after dealing with so many documents . But I heard the notice that our company will hold two-week staff training . __eou__ Stop fussing ! It is said that the training is important for our newcomers . And my company also informs me to attend the training next week . __eou__ But for me , the training is waste of my precious time . __eou__ I disagree with you . Companies usually make a workable and reasonable plan for the trainings , so as to improve new comers ' understanding of the company and its rules in short time .

Oh , and there ’ s a cooling system and a filter . It's all controlled by a PLC system – that stands for Process Logic Control . __eou__
Very good . Now , I have a couple of final questions . __eou__ I hope they ’ re not too hard ! __eou__ Well , why should we hire you ? __eou__ I think that I would be a perfect fit in this company . I have a unique combination of strong technical acumen , and outstanding soft skills . you know , I excel at building strong , long-term customer relationships . For example , when I headed the customer support department in my previous company , our team solved about seventy percent of our customers ’ problems . I decided that we needed better information and technical preparation on our products , so after I implemented a series of training sessions in coordination with our technical department , we were able to solve ninety percent of our customers ’ issues . Given the opportunity , I could bring this kind of success to this company . __eou__ Impressive ! So , what would you consider to be your greatest weakness ? __eou__ I struggle with organization and time management . Punctuality has never been a strength of mine . I find it hard to organize my time efficiently . I have actually addressed this weakness recently , by attending a workshop on efficient time management . It helped me a lot , by providing me with great insights on how to get organized and use my time efficiently , so I think I ’ m getting better now . __eou__ Great ... Well , let me tell you that I am very pleased with this interview . We are short-listing our candidates this week , and next week we will inform our short listed candidates of the day and time for a second interview with our CEO . __eou__ Great , thanks a lot !

What are they going to do when Maggie comes back from leave . __eou__ If the new girl is competent , maybe they will promote her when that time comes . __eou__

A sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly . Sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people . If there is one thing that all the shows have in common , it is teaching wholesome values . __eou__ In Taiwan , prime-time shows are an hour long and most of them aren't comedies . __eou__ I think Americans would rather laugh than cry or be scared in their free time . __eou__

How did you choose courses when you were abroad ? __eou__ That's a very good question . Choosing proper courses and effectively planning a college schedule is very important to the progress toward your educational goal . In order to do these wisely and effectively , you should consult with a Program Adviser or Academic Counselor . __eou__ Wait a minute . There are some new terms for me . I can hardly follow you . __eou__ Ok , I will go into more detail .

And the length depends on the particular situation . __eou__ Only when you are aware of what the interviewer will be interested in , can you make a targeted preparation . __eou__ To sell yourself successfully , you should leave the interviewer a deep impression . __eou__ Selling yourself should go straight to the point , and the statement should be clear and brief . __eou__ It should also be truthful and realistic .

Hey . Owen ! Have you gone on your family vacation yet ? __eou__ Oh , yes . I got so tired . My son began to cry the moment we got on the train . It was very embarrassing because we took the over-night train and the noise made it difficult for other people in the cabin to sleep . __eou__ Didn't you bring his favorite toy ? __eou__ Yes , we did . Fortunately we put his Teddy Bear in the bag , and finally he fell asleep at mid-night with it in his arms . __eou__ Where did you go ? You've got a beautiful tan . __eou__ My wife didn't like to go to amusement parks , so we compromised and finally went to the seaside . I think vacation in summer is not good . __eou__ You must have had a great time . Most children love to play in the sand on the beach and go swimming . __eou__ Yes , he was every excited to see the blue sea and picked up many seashells to give as gift for his classmates in kindergarten . __eou__ His friends will be very happy to get the little souvenir . __eou__ And I taught him how to swim in the sea . It was fun and made him braver than before . After we returned home , he wasn't afraid to sleep alone in his bedroom . __eou__

What's your favorite sport ? __eou__ It's hard to say . Perhaps swimming is my favorite . I like swimming because it helps improve my lung capacity . In the scorching summer days , there's nothing like a cool swim . Currently , I go to the pool twice every week . __eou__ Is the entrance charge expensive ? __eou__ Well , it costs an arm and a leg — 30 yuan per person . What a costly sport ! That is why I have to refrain from even thinking about it . And I find jogging a very agreeable substitute . __eou__ Haha , jogging ? Perhaps it might be a bit too boring ? __eou__ You know what ? You won't get a rush from it until you fully understand it . It is a simple sport and doesn't require skills of any sort . This leaves room for me to enjoy the beautiful suburban scenery while jogging . Fresh air caresses my face and blows into my chest , which translates into inspirations . Inspirations are really good stuff for a writer like me . Sometimes , I even come up with a verse or two . __eou__ You are really a man who knows how to enjoy being alone . __eou__

And i know that song very well , so , i didn't need to pay attention to the subtitles which helped as well . __eou__ You're too modest . Pass me the catalogue ! I'd like to see which song to choose.Wow , this place has a large selection of songs . I dont know which to choose ! __eou__ Pick the one that you always sing in the shower . __eou__ Funny.Oh , i like this song .

Hurry up , guys ! The train is about to leave . __eou__ We're coming . __eou__

But I still think the provision of arbitration is of great importance to both of us . __eou__ All right . I agree with you . But where do we hold arbitration ? __eou__ I suggest the arbitration be held in a third country . __eou__ It sounds reasonable . The clause should be like this - any disputes arising from the execution of this contract shall be settled in a friendly way . If no settlement can be reached through consul - nation and conciliation , the disputes shall be submitted for arbitration by a mutually nominated arbitrator . The arbitrator's decision on the dispute is final and binding on the both parties . __eou__ Ok . __eou__
See how many people are here ! __eou__ Yeah ! Do all these people work in the company ? Everyone and their dog is here ! __eou__ Other than the employees , our boss Jack invited some friends of the company . __eou__ Can we just sit wherever we want ? __eou__ Of course not ! We have to sit at our assigned seats . I think our table is over there in the back . __eou__ Hmm . We don't exactly have the best seats in the house , do we ? __eou__ Look who you get to sit next to--Tim from purchasing ! __eou__ Www ! That weirdo ? ! He really gives me the creeps ! __eou__ Don't worry . I'm also sitting next to you . __eou__ I just hope he doesn't start bragging again ! __eou__ I can't wait until we get our year-end bonus ! __eou__ Me , either ! Who decides how much money we get ? __eou__
Ms.Dawson , I need you to take a dictation for me . __eou__ Yes , sir ... __eou__ This should go out as an intra-office memorandum to all employees by this afternoon.Are you ready ? __eou__ Yes , sir.Go ahead . __eou__ Attention all staff ... Effective immediately , all office communications are restricted to email correspondence and official memos.The use of Instant Message programs by employees during working hours is strictly prohibited . __eou__ Sir , does this apply to intra-office communications only ? Or will it also restrict external communications ? __eou__ It should apply to all communications , not only in this office between employees , but also any outside communications . __eou__ But sir , many employees use Instant Messaging to communicate with their clients . __eou__ They will just have to change their communication methods . I don't want any - one using Instant Messaging in this office.It wastes too much time ! Now , please continue with the memo.Where were we ? __eou__ This applies to internal and external communications . __eou__ Yes.Any employee who persists in using Instant Messaging will first receive a warning and be placed on probation.At second offense , the employee will face termination.Any questions regarding this new policy may be directed to department heads . __eou__ Is that all ? __eou__ Yes.Please get this memo typed up and distributed to all employees before 4 pm . __eou__
What are your terms of sale ? __eou__ The price quoted is for CIF . __eou__ My understanding is that CIF means the seller is responsible for prepaying shipping costs and arranging for the insurance policy . __eou__ Yes , that is correct . We will arrange for the shipping costs and insurance policy . __eou__ Is it possible to consider FOB ? That way , we will handle the insurance through our broker . __eou__ Yes , we could also make this arrangement , , if you prefer . __eou__
God , I didn ’ t realize . I didn ’ t , I didn ’ t know ... __eou__ ... Who you were with ? I didn ’ t know whom you were with . __eou__ Excuse me ? __eou__ Sorry , it ’ s from the Godfather . It ’ s when the , when the movie producer realizes Tom Higgins had emissary of Vito Corleone , it ’ s just before the horse ’ s head ends up in the bed with all the bloody sheets , you know , wakes up , and AAAL ! Never mind . __eou__ You were spying on me , weren ’ t you ? You probably rented those children . __eou__ Why would I spy on you ? __eou__ Because I am your competition which you know perfectly well , or you would not put up that sign just around the corner . __eou__ The entrance to our store is around the corner . And there ’ s no other way of saying that . It ’ s not the name of our store . It ’ s where it is . And you do not own the phrase around the corner . __eou__ What is that ? What are you doing ? You ’ re taking all the caviar ! That caviar is a garnish ? __eou__ Look , the reason I came into your store is because I was spending the day with Annabell and matt . And I was buying them presents . I ’ m the type of guy who likes to buy his way into the hearts of children who are his relative . And there ’ s only one place to find a children ’ s book in the neighborhood . That will not always be the case . And it was yours . And it is a charming little bookstore . You probably sell what 350,000 worth of books in a year . __eou__
Look ! Mom , that's amazing ! I can't believe the girls have so neat movements . __eou__ Yeah , they all received very strict training . A minute on the stage takes ten-year practice . __eou__ And all their movements are so elegant . It seems like dancing in the water . __eou__ Exactly , you know , water ballet puts dancing , music and swimming together . __eou__ There you go ! Daddy has told me that water ballet is also called Synchronized Swimming . __eou__ That's my boy ! Katherine Curtis created this activity in 1920 . And in 1984 , it was authorized as one activity in Olympic Games . __eou__ Wow , Mom is more knowledgeable than Dad . I must learn from you . __eou__ My little boy , you should learn more from me . I'm almost thirty years older than you . __eou__ OK , you're the boss . Look , Mom , one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool . __eou__ Oh , my God . It's so dangerous . And he might break his leg . You mustn't do anything like that . __eou__
I am totally fed up with my boss . He has crossed the line one too many times with his sexist comments . This time I am really going to report him for sexual harassment . __eou__ What happened ? Did your boss say something to offend you at work ? __eou__ He constantly lets inappropriate things slip out , referring to the women employees as girls or calling us sweetheart or darling . I doubt any of my male colleagues would stand for such treatment . __eou__ Don ’ t you think you are overreacting a little ? Calling you by nicknames shouldn ’ t be so bad ... __eou__ You ’ re missing the point . It ’ s about respect . He treats us with such a patronizing attitude , as if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co-workers . It ’ s his attitude that needs to be changed , not just his words . __eou__ That ’ s what you get for working in a male-dominated field . I think you ’ ll find that most male bosses in your industry are already conditioned to treat females in this way . You probably won ’ t be able to change him . __eou__
This Olympic park is so big ! __eou__ Yes . Now we are in the Olympic stadium , the center of this park . __eou__ Splendid !

Hey , look the sign here , No climbing . __eou__ We put many signs with English translations for foreign visitors . __eou__
How do you want to advertise the opening ? __eou__ I've had good responses from the Beijing Times , help-wanted ads . __eou__ All right . I suggest posting the ad Monday through Friday . __eou__ OK . Monday is the big day for job ads . __eou__ And job seekers will certainly check the paper over on Tuesday . __eou__ Let's post on the Internet , too . Will get a better response . I'll post the ads . I know some good sites . __eou__ Such concern for the company , Craig ! I'm impressed . __eou__
Hi , Sarah . The results of questionnaire have come out . We need to discuss it together then write a research report . __eou__ How is the new product ? __eou__ 30 % of the people are attracted by the style . Buyers always pay great attention to packing . In my opinion , these goods didn't sell well merely because of the poor packing . __eou__ Yes , I think so . And how about the price ? __eou__ Almost 30 % of the consumers can ’ t accept the price . Maybe we should lower our price a little . __eou__ Yes , I agree with you . We should add our opinions to the research report . __eou__ Absolutely . __eou__
What's your main range ? __eou__ Generally speaking , we provide bikes for both gentlemen and ladies , size 19 , 21 , 23 , 25 and 27 inches . We can vary the colors according to the buyer's requirements . Here are the catalogues and the pattern books . They will give you a rough idea about our products . __eou__ I am interested in your flying pigeon bicycles . I think some of these items will find a ready market in Canada . But what our customers appreciate most is a reliable product . __eou__ To be reliable is the strong point of our products . As a matter of fact , it's always our practice to supply high quality goods at reasonable prices . Flying pigeon is the best of its kind at the price . __eou__ Then I'd like to know your availability of the products and the terms of sales , such as mode of payment , delivery , discounts , etc . __eou__
Wow , this is drop-dead gorgeous . __eou__ So no more regret now ? __eou__ Don't remind me of that . This would be the last time I cut any classes for a basketball game . __eou__ Come on . Don't be so hard on yourself . Enjoy your life . __eou__ I just can't help it . Oh , look at Clive , he is really a big hit . They are definitely gonna win . __eou__ It's only seven minutes into the game , too early to cheer up . __eou__ Come on , 18 points already , they are never gonna catch up . __eou__ Who knows ! It's a long game . Look ! That was a really nice shot ! __eou__ Thay are coming back to narrow the gap . __eou__ Wait , that guy , I know him . He is just a bench warmer . __eou__ A secret weapon . They'd better set up the defense now . __eou__ Clive is ready to explode . Keep your eyes open . __eou__ Oh , man ! I can't believe it . A slam dunk ! __eou__ Good that he resembled his old , quick self . __eou__

The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest . __eou__ Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? The same is true in the West . __eou__ No , absolutely not ! On the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . But always pay attention to what you say . If the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested . __eou__ You mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? That goes in like with Confucius ' preachings , right ? __eou__ Correct . Show respect for the older people . Conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other . __eou__ Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ? __eou__ Yes , plenty of them . Don't eat fast ! People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely . __eou__ Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ? __eou__ Haha , I'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate . __eou__
Our housing problem is a highly complicated issue . __eou__ It is true . I think we should change some policies . __eou__ Right . Like our LPF program . The mortgage size is linked with the amount of savings households have accumulated on their LPF accounts . __eou__ Indeed , it's unfair . Households with higher salaries receive larger LPF contributions and thus qualify for larger loans . Lower-income households , on the other hand , can only get smaller loans , or perhaps nothing if they could not afford to purchase any housing . __eou__ Like you and me ! __eou__
Hi , Bill . __eou__ Hi , Jim . __eou__ Where is that cool guy , Dick ? I haven ’ t seen him for two weeks . __eou__ He ’ s been sick since he came back from Italy . __eou__ Bummer , I ’ m sorry to hear that , is he better now ? __eou__ Yes , Doctor William said that he could come back to work ASAP . __eou__
Right , that ends the third and final part of our presentation . I'd like to end by emphasizing the main points . I'll give you a brief summary . There are three potential areas for development in the future , domestic , overseas market , and the internet . Each of these markets have their own particular need for marketing strategy ... for domestic , we can rely on past research , for overseas markets we depend heavily on our cultural consultants , and for the internet , we need to redo our image to appeal to a young set of consumers . Our main issue here is that we need to be sensitive to the needs of different markets in order to continue to see success . Mark , did you have anything to add ? __eou__ Yes , I want to restate one more time the importance of reinventing our company's image to appeal to different customer bases . I want to end with a true story that has to do exactly with what we've been talking about today ... __eou__
How large is the plant ? __eou__ It covers an area of 75,000 square meters . __eou__ It ’ s much larger than I expected . When was the plant set up ? __eou__ In the early 70s . We ’ ll soon be celebrating the 30th anniversary . __eou__ Congratulations ! __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ How many employees do you have in this plant ? __eou__ 500 . We ’ re running on three shifts . __eou__ Does the plant work with everything from the raw material to the finished product ? __eou__ Our associates specializing in these fields make some access - ries .

Can you tell Bob from Tom ? __eou__ How can I ? They're as alike as two peas in a pod . __eou__ Don't you notice that Bob has a mole on his face , but Tom does not . __eou__ You really have keen eyes . __eou__
Every time when heroes came back from the battlefield , we took our hats off to them . __eou__ You were showing respect and admiration for them . __eou__ I wish I were a hero . __eou__
Mary sings much better than Susan , doesn't she ? __eou__ Yes.But Mary is no match for Susan in painting . __eou__ Maybe it's because Susan's parents are both painters . __eou__
I hear many people here speak French . __eou__ It is because Montreal is a bilingual city . __eou__ It is not easy to improve my English . __eou__ But it's a good opportunity to learn French . __eou__ Yeah ! But French is not easy to learn . __eou__ Take it easy . I have the confidence to learn it well . __eou__
As an experienced interviewer , could you tell me what kind of behavior the interviewer hates most ? __eou__ Rudeness . You are not expected to sit down before being invited , and you shouldn ’ t throw yourself into the chair like you ’ re loading heavy baggage . __eou__ And we should have good sitting posture . __eou__ That ’ s right . The ideal posture for women is to put their legs together and lean to one side . This is especially important in summer . __eou__ Where should I put my overcoat and briefcase after entering the office ? __eou__ Put it beside you . Don ’ t pile your purses , briefcase and other belongings on the employer ’ s desk . You've got long hair . Don ’ t touch it while talking to the interviewer . It gives people the feeling that you cannot concentrate on your work . __eou__ I think that ’ s the reason why Princess Diana ’ s hair style became so popular . __eou__ Also , if you are asked to sit beside the employer's desk , neither lean on it nor look at the documents there . __eou__ I ought to respect other people ’ s privacy , as most Westerners do . __eou__ As the saying goes , when in Rome , do as the Romans do . __eou__
Did you watch the movie program on Channel 6 last night ? __eou__ Yes , I did . It is a horrible movie . __eou__ I wonder why TV programs often show much violence . __eou__ Actually , more and more people have realized that violence on TV may lead to the increase of crime rates among teenagers . __eou__ They are especially harmful to teenagers . __eou__ But anyhow there are many worthwhile programs . __eou__
Herman , why are you so excited ? __eou__ I have met a beautiful girl . __eou__ Have you fallen in love ? __eou__ Yes . At first sight . __eou__ Can you describe the situation at that time ? __eou__ At that time her back was ramrod straight as she sailed by , her tone is best , neither over-passionate , nor too cold . __eou__ What's her outlook ? __eou__ She was pretty , her hair was the color of rich dark chocolate , waving gently to her shoulders . Her complexion was clear and golden . __eou__
My friend finally dumped her boyfriend , and she's sworn she's going to abstain until she finds the right man to marry . __eou__ After going through an episode like that I'm not surprised . How's her headspace ? __eou__ She's doing great , she's getting her confidence back , and her self-esteem , has improved drastically.She ' s very happy . __eou__ I'm proud of you for standing by her . I think you've helped make a big difference in her life . __eou__ Do you have any plans for next Sunday evening ? __eou__ No , why ? __eou__ My friend , who had the mishap , wants to take us to dinner to show her gratitude for helping her . __eou__ She doesn't need to do that , I didn't do anything . __eou__ She feels you gave me the freedom to be able to assist her and she appreciates that . Come on , Let's indulge her . __eou__
What ’ s the difference between football and rugby ? __eou__ Those tow games are quite different . First , there ’ s the size of the teams . In football , a team has 11 players . In rugby there are 15 players on each team . The biggest difference is that in football , only the goalkeeper can use his hands . In rugby , the ball is usually carried forward by players , though kicking is permitted . __eou__ In rugby , players pass the ball by throwing it to team mates , don ’ t they ? __eou__ That ’ s right . However , players can only pass the ball backwards . They cannot pass the ball forwards to their team mates . That ’ s a foul . __eou__ I know how goals are scored in football , but how about in rugby ? __eou__ If a team carries the ball over the goal line , they score points . A team can also score points by kicking the ball between two tall posts at each end of the pitch . __eou__ There ’ s a lot more physical contact in rugby , isn ’ t there ? __eou__ Yes . Players usually need to bring a player down to stop him from moving forward with the ball . This is called ” tackling ” , as in football . __eou__ The ball is a different shape in rugby , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Yes . It ’ s not perfectly round like a football . A rugby ball is oval in shape . There ’ s a match on TV this afternoon . Why don ’ t you watch it with me ? I ’ ll try to explain the rules and tactics while we ’ re watching . __eou__ Ok . __eou__
Welcome ! Sophia told us you were coming ! __eou__ Um ... It's wonderful to be here . Uh ... this place looks really cozy . __eou__ Thank you ! Your cheeks are as red as a tomato !

You will love it ! __eou__ Great . My face will turn even redder ! __eou__
What kind of books do you like ? __eou__ I like reading novels about early America . __eou__ Really ?

Though the words he used are simple , but the spirit he has conveyed is great . __eou__ Absolutely ! __eou__

The goods are being wrapped and loaded onto pallets ready for transportation . __eou__
Good afternoon , welcome to IBA . How can I be of service ? __eou__ I'd like to talk to somebody about the Group Account Deposit Service . __eou__ This refers to the deposit business offered to the level 1 account of group companies . __eou__ What is it used for ? I mean , why bother to get this special account ? __eou__ Group companies can use this to make their arrangement of funds flexible , when dealing with their subsidiaries . __eou__ I see , so this can really cut down on time and centralise management . Interesting ... __eou__
Mommy , can I stay up until eleven o'clock ? __eou__ No . Go to bed right now . __eou__
Who ate the cookies that were sitting here ? __eou__ I did , Mom . __eou__ Shame on you . I was saving them for your brother . __eou__
Is there any meat ? __eou__ Yes , just tinned meat . __eou__ Is it chicken ? __eou__ No , it ’ s beef . __eou__ Is it ready to eat ? __eou__ Well , you ’ d better heat it before you eat it . __eou__
Reciting texts really bores me to death . __eou__ Do you have to remember every text ? __eou__ Yes , the teacher says recitation is real good . __eou__
He's been compared to Rimbaud , you know . __eou__ You mean as in Sylvester Stallone ? __eou__ No , you idiot . I mean the poet , Arthur Rimbaud - R , I , M , B , A , U , D . __eou__
It's quite cold this early morning , isn't it ? __eou__ Yeah . It's already December , you know . __eou__ Time sure flies , doesn't it ? __eou__
When you told your mom you would be home around 2 am , She must have a cow ! __eou__ You are right . My mum must be crazy . __eou__
I was surprised to see how few people you have on-site . You provide a wide range of goods and services but have a very small workforce . __eou__ It depends on the time of year . At peak times we hire in casual workers to help with packing and dispatch . We also contract out certain services all year round , for example , cleaning . We run a very tight operation ! __eou__ Do you handle the recruiting yourselves ? __eou__ Sometimes we use a local employment agency . It depends on the job . __eou__
Could you explain the paper-making process to us - in very simple terms - please ? __eou__ Well , the pulp falls from a box onto the first part of the paper machine , which is basically a wire bed with large holes in it , where most of the water is extracted . __eou__ So , is it actually paper at this stage ? __eou__ Yes , it is . But we need to take out more water . So it then passes through a series of rollers , where more water is squeezed out . After that it goes through the dryers , which are at a very high temperature . The paper is then coated . And finally it's wound onto reels and cut down into smaller lengths . __eou__
We're going to discuss how to market CB series soon . Does your project go well ? __eou__ Absolutely . I've sorted out all the materials we need and sifted three great ways of marketing . __eou__ Oh , that's good . __eou__ We can discuss them detailedly over the meeting and choose the best way to promote our key products . __eou__ It seems you've got everything done . Now I can finally stop worrying about it and get back to work . __eou__
What do you reading , Linda ? __eou__ I'm reading a novel , The mill on the floss , written by the famous novelist gorge alias . __eou__ What's it about ? __eou__ It's meanly about relationship between a brother and a sister , who live in the mill on the river floss . It describe there are childhood and disputes cause them to separate , the book ends with them ha __eou__ Is it difficult to understand ? __eou__ Not really , i would consider it easy . __eou__ Besides novels , any other types literary works that you indulgence . __eou__ I really like short stories . __eou__ Have you read anything else besides literature ? __eou__ Certainly I have . I like to read books on vary subjects , and i can read everything I can get my hands on in my spare time . I don't want to idle away and waste my time . __eou__ I agree . People who don't read are no better often people who can't read . I also agree that books are like food for the mind . __eou__

Sing with us ! __eou__ I'm sorry , but I can't ! That's something my grandmother would sing ! __eou__
Wasn't that a great flick ? I was on the edge of my seat through the whole movie . __eou__ I would say it was a typical run-of-the-mill Hollywood thriller . __eou__ Well , I'm no movie expert , but those special effects were impressive by any standards . __eou__ Special effects ? Baloney ! That movie was made on a shoestring budget . They've been using trick photography like that for years __eou__ Okay . But you have to admit that it was an exciting story , especially with that surprise ending . __eou__ You should read the book . The original story is much better and has a different twist at the end . __eou__ Oh , really ? How does the book end ? __eou__ Read it yourself and find out ! __eou__
I cannot understand why she always helps and supports her brother . __eou__ Why do you say so ? __eou__ Because he is often in trouble . __eou__ She has promised her mother that she would be with him through thick and thin . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__
Mike has changed much after marriage . __eou__ Yeah . He ’ s almost become a slave , his wife is leading him by the nose . __eou__ It ’ s unbelievable . He used to be such a rough guy . __eou__
What ’ s “ pi ” ? __eou__ That ’ s the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter , I think . __eou__ I see . What is that ratio exactly ? __eou__ It ’ s approximately 3.14 , but the number continues forever . What ’ s the diameter of your circle ? __eou__ It ’ s 10 centimeters , so the circumference should be 31.4 centimeters . __eou__ Ok . My next problem is to convert 10000 british pounds into us dollars . What ’ s the exchange rate at the moment ? __eou__ According to the newspaper , the exchange rate is 1.85 dollars to the pound . __eou__ That means that 10.000 pounds will buy me 18.500 dollars . __eou__ What ’ s the next question . __eou__ Fractions . What ’ s a quarter and an eighth ? That ’ s three-eights . Easy . The next question is “ what are prime numbers ? ” . __eou__ I can help you there . Those are numbers that cannot be created by multiplying two whole numbers , apart from the number itself and 1 , together . __eou__ So , 1,2 and 3 are prime numbers , but 4 isn ’ t because 2 * 2 = 4 . __eou__ Exactly . Anything else ? __eou__ How many seconds in an hour ? 60 seconds multiplied by 60 minutes equals 3600 seconds altogether . __eou__ You ’ ll be a mathematician one day . __eou__
I enjoy the folk song and dance show very much . __eou__ I'm glad you appreciate our folk music . But a live performance is much more interesting . __eou__ I can't wait anymore . When does the performance start ? __eou__ The show starts at 7 and is over at around 10 o'clock p . m . __eou__ ( After the show ) It's an excellent musical . The acting was very expressive and the songs and dancing were superb . __eou__ I'm glad you enjoyed it . It's had long run , but the house has always been full . __eou__ What do you think of the leading actors ? __eou__ Personally I liked the main character . He was true to type . __eou__ You are a better judge . I don't know the play well enough . __eou__

I usually take two weeks off in the summer and the rest at New Year . __eou__ Do you do overtime ? __eou__ Yes , if we're busy . I'm paid double-time if I work at weekends . __eou__
Our productivity has been down for more than six months now . I'm seriously considering pulling in an outside consultant to diagnose the cause of our problematic areas . I think we'd all benefit from an outsider's perspective . Sometimes we're just too closed to the problems to see the forest for the trees . __eou__ I think that's a good idea .

We gave him a big carrot for a nose . __eou__ Let me help you make one this year . __eou__

Have a good rest and you will feel energetic again . __eou__ One of my friends took the Adult College Entrance Exam last year . He filled the school column with his name , and his score was relinquished . __eou__ How could he make such a silly mistake ? __eou__ He said he hadn't taken any exams for ten years , and couldn't get used to it immediately . He was extremely nervous then . __eou__ He lost a very good chance to go to college , didn't he ? __eou__ Yeah . The test was fairly easy and almost every test-taker could pass that exam . Adult College Entrance Exam is much easier than college entrance exam . And there are fewer subjects . __eou__ That's a very good lesson . We must familiarize ourselves with the exam from now on . __eou__
I hear scientists in the US have discovered a new AIDS vaccine . __eou__ Does it work ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . The report says it is better than the old vaccines . __eou__ Don ’ t count on it .

That ’ s why doctor say AIDS prevention means cleanness . __eou__

How can we develop a new brand image with no direction whatsoever ? __eou__ With the fifty forwards he sent out today , maybe we'll inadvertently get inspired . __eou__ I guess this is a good excuse to surf the Net on someone else's dime . __eou__ Who'd have thought Bean would be this kind of e-mail fanatic ? __eou__ He must have just got online for the first time last week .

Who is this on the water buffalo ? __eou__ That's my grand-father . He was a farmer . When he was young , he had to take the water buffalo to graze in the field . __eou__ Oh yes , that was the best job in most farm families . That's where many of them learned to play the flute . __eou__ My grandfather did that too . He used the time to study instead . __eou__ That's interesting . Go on ! __eou__ My grand grandfather was a merchant who ran a small business . He couldn't afford to send my grand father to school . __eou__ So he became a self-taught man ? __eou__ Right .

Besides , I would like to make it clear that each piece of computer will be dismantled into several parts before shipment . __eou__ Do you mean that we are responsible for putting them together ? __eou__ Yes . As you know , that's the common practice for exporting computer . This can avoid some damages on computers in the process of transportation . __eou__ I see . Why not use wooden cases ? __eou__ If you prefer wooden cases , we will provide them . But cardboard boxes are light , less expensive , and more convenient to handle in the course of packing and unpacking . __eou__ Oh , I know . Does it mean that shipment will have to be delayed if I insist on using wooden cases ? __eou__ Perhaps . That will be more complicated , if we use wooden boxes . __eou__ Then you may use cardboard boxes for outer packing so long as you can guarantee the safety of the computers . __eou__ That is guaranteed . Each box is lined with foam plastic in order to prevent damage by air , water or stress . Besides , cardboard boxes will be secured together on wood pallets by overall metal strapping . __eou__ Sounds good . __eou__
Good morning , Helen . __eou__ Good morning , Steven . __eou__ So , what's the status of our advertising campaign ? __eou__ It'll be a national campaign starting next week . __eou__ What style will the ads be ? __eou__ I suggest that we focus on slice of life , showing how you can beat the summer heat by biting into a cool ice-cream sandwich . __eou__ Sounds like a good idea .

Welcome back movie lovers to another Premier Movie Review . My name is Richard Clarke and I am joined today by the very erudite DavidWatson . __eou__ Thank you Dick . Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King . Tell me Dave , what is your impression of this film ? __eou__ Well , I think this film is simply a fable , depicting man ’ s eternal greed for power , and in my opinion , it ’ s a very fine film . Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries.The musical score was amazing , the animation was very well done , and the story was simply enchanting . __eou__ I think otherwise . Even though the animation was technically strong , and as you say , the score and songs performed by Elton John were great , the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart . And I would dare to say , it was too predictable . __eou__ Predictable ! How ! Come on Dick , It ’ s a G-rated movie ! It ’ s for the kids ! It ’ s not a thriller ! __eou__ Well , that ’ s just it . It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes For example when Mufasal dies , or the dark , grim portrayal of Scar . Even so , the film is linear . Mufasal dies , Simba runs away thinking it ’ s his fault . Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his . It ’ s just too cliche . __eou__ How can it be cliche ? It ’ s a fable ! It ’ s telling a time-honoured story ! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption , and teaches children the value of respect , life and love . __eou__ You have always been so soft , Dave ! __eou__ Open your heart Dick . Don ’ t shut us out . __eou__ Anyway ... That ’ s all for today folks ! Join us next time as we talk about & quot , How to lose a guy in 10 days & quot , I ’ m sure you ’ ll love that one Dave ! __eou__
Strange looking handle on that coffee mug , isn't it ? __eou__ We submitted two designs to our buyers , this one and one with the mug indented to form a grip . They chose this one . __eou__ What's the advantage ? Price , I suppose . __eou__ No , this type cleans better , no crevices between the body and handle joint . __eou__ What deliveries are you quoting nowadays on orders such as ours ? __eou__ We can make shipment within one month from receipt of order . __eou__ You don't do much in porcelain tiles and ornaments , do you ? __eou__ We do a fair amount in tiles and in insulators for electrical appliances . But kitchenware and tableware are our mainlines . __eou__ I see . Well , keep up the good work . See you later . __eou__
Now let's use the weight machines . __eou__ How about the rowing machine __eou__ Great . They've all got built-in TVs . __eou__ Cool ! We can watch Ally Mcneal ! __eou__ But we could just stay there for 20 minutes . __eou__ What exercises can I do to firm up my backside __eou__ I would recommend doing some squats . Spread your feet about shoulder-length apart , toes facing forward , and slowly bend at your knees . __eou__ Like this ? __eou__ Keep your back straight and look forward . Good . Do about 3 sets of 20 . __eou__

She can't speak to you now ! " Then I arrived home at six o'clock yesterday evening . He telephoned again .

This one seems to be moving more quickly than the others . __eou__ Maybe our checker is faster at scanning the food . __eou__ I ’ m glad . We have only about twenty things here , and I ’ m in a hurry to get home . __eou__
It's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed ... The trade deficit is getting larger , consumption's down , I really think we're headed for a recession . __eou__ The economy has been stagnant for a while now . We've been in a recessive state for several months already . What worries me the most is the trade deficit . I think the government should do more to encourage exports . __eou__ Increasing exports would weaken the currency . I think the main point is economic growth . We need more jobs . Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . If more people are working , it will give the economy a boost . __eou__ It's true that we should do something about unemployment , but what about inflation ? If unemployment falls , there's pressure to increase pay . That would result in inflation , which would result in a much less dynamic economy . __eou__
What reasons do westerners drink for ? __eou__ I don't think drinking requires any special purposes . For us people in the West , the purpose is generally quite simple-to savor the wine . __eou__ I know what you mean there . In many circumstances , people kiss the baby for the nurse's sake . And that's what we do when drinking at a banquet . Even though we do have a rich variety of brand-name wines , like Matai and Showing Yellow Rice Wine , alcohol is usually served not for the enjoyment itself . We just be its Dionysus effect to enliven the atmosphere , improve personal association with each other and solidify friendship . __eou__ And to make matters worse , you're urged to drink " one more cup time and again.There is too much etiquette to observe . You'II be set free at a Western banquet It seems we are keen to make it convenient as possible to savor the wine , its color , its aroma and its delicate taste . __eou__ Yeah . It's of supreme importance that the goblet , table-cloth , and plates should be made shiningly clean , so that the color of the wine is clearly visible and the delicate aroma and taste are fully appreciable . __eou__ Yes . For me , who can't hold much liquor , it's particularly agreeable . If only I had thechance to enjoy Chinese Matai at a leisured pace while sitting at a Western banquet ! __eou__
What are you using for bait today ? __eou__ We are fishing with worms . The fish seem to like them . __eou__ Is that so ? We're using lures , and the fish are biting those too . __eou__ Looks like a lucky day for everyone . __eou__
He said he will get married by the end of this month . __eou__ Big talk , I ’ d say . He does not have a girlfriend yet . __eou__ Who knows . After all , he is handsome and rich . __eou__

Mary , I heard you moved again . __eou__ Yeah . I could not stand living here . There is always much noise in the neighborhood . __eou__ You mean noise ? How could it be ? __eou__ You know , on weekends when we wanted to have late rise in the morning , our neighbour started to raise Cain . __eou__
Mr . Brown is in hospital again . __eou__ Is he ? He ’ s never been healthy . __eou__ When I went to see him yesterday , he looked rather pale . __eou__ I ’ m afraid he won ’ t make old bones . __eou__
I think the government needs a radical plan to improve things . The government just talks , but in the long run , nothing is done to improve the economy . __eou__ That's right . They always talk about a need for new , progressive tactics , but they haven't done anything to stimulate new jobs . __eou__ Well , income taxes were decreased last year in hope to give the economy a boost , but I think it's backfired . The immediate effect of the tax reduction was to cause inflation to rise . __eou__ The worst part is that the inflation hurts the poor more than the rich . It also leads to more unemployment in the long run . I don't know what a good solution would be to make the economy more vibrant again ... __eou__ I have a good solution ... We need some new blood ! We should get rid of this president and boat in some new leaders ! __eou__
Sorry , I have to rush off and catch the 9 o'clock train to Paris . __eou__ Then you must hurry up.There ' s only ten minutes left . __eou__ Until we meet again . __eou__

Smith checked out this morning . __eou__ Oh , he did ? May I have his forwarding address , please ? __eou__ I ' m afraid he didn ’ t leave one . __eou__
There are so many people that the tickets are all sold out ! __eou__ Luckily we got the last two . __eou__ Look , Danny . The Four Great Inventions ! __eou__ Gunpowder , compass , the paper making , and the printing . __eou__ I really admire those who made such great inventions ! __eou__ May , I don't see why they are great . They are just simple things . __eou__ They look simple today . But they were milestones in their times . __eou__ Milestones ? May , you must be kidding . __eou__ Just think Bill Gates , those inventions are as important as the windows system . __eou__ Well , I suppose the ancient inventors made a lot of money out of them . __eou__ No , quite the contrary . __eou__ Why ? Didn't you say that they were milestones ? __eou__ Yes , but they went to the public without any patent protection . __eou__ Well , their inventors were not as clever as Bill Gates . __eou__
Next is a ballet performance , but who is the dancer ? __eou__ I'd swear that's Eddy from circulation . __eou__ Since when did Eddy start doing ballet ? ! __eou__ Not very long from the looks of it ! __eou__ Look ! He has a partner ! __eou__ He's dancing with Jack ! __eou__ Gross ! __eou__ The wei-ya is the one time a year you can make fun of the boss . __eou__ But I think Eddy is going too far ! __eou__ You're right . They are spinning pretty fast . Aren't they getting dizzy ? What if they fall ... __eou__ Oh ! Ouch ! That must've hurt ! __eou__ How embarrassing ! __eou__
What's holding us back on the plant expansion project ? We were supposed to see the specs on that ages ago.Why haven't I heard anything about it ? Did the whole project just vanish into thin air ? __eou__ No , sir . The plant expansion project has been delayed.There was a snag up in the fling process to get the necessary construction permits.It seems that the property we were slated to build on is also habitat for some endangered indigenous species . __eou__ You're joking , right ? No wonder we've been tied up with this project . I know the environmental impact statement will take forever to get approval if they've found anything endangered on the site . Are they positive there is evidence of endangered species actually living there ? __eou__ The environmental review board has a team on it now.Hopefully we'll know more by the end of the week . __eou__
I ’ m so frustrated ! __eou__ what ’ s wrong , Jim ? __eou__ I called the electronics shop to find out what time they close , and it took me twenty minutes to get what I wanted ! __eou__ Twenty minutes just to find out what their business hours are ? __eou__ yes.They have some sort of digital receptionist.So when I called in , a machine told me to push a button for the department I wanted to be transferred to . __eou__ Oh , I hate getting voicemail instead of a person.What did you do ? __eou__ I just kept pushing buttons . I was transferred to customer service , but there a machine told me to choose between technical help , warranty information , or price information . __eou__ Couldn ’ d you choose to be transferred to a real person ? __eou__ Eventually I did get to a real person . I found out the closing time , but by then the store had already closed ! __eou__
Hello , Janet . __eou__ Good morning , Pete . __eou__ And what is this ? __eou__ Ah , this is my daughter's birthday present . Her birthday is next week . __eou__ And when is your son's birthday ? __eou__ That is not for a while . His birthday is only in August . __eou__ But Mark's birthday is in April so I need to think about his present soon . __eou__ And when is your birthday ? __eou__ Oh , my birthday is in December just before Xmas so of course nobody remembers . __eou__ My birthday is in June , when we are always on holiday . So my family often forgets my birthday too . __eou__
I am confused . How could a golfer need so many clubs ? Seems to me , 14 altogether , right __eou__ I should say , a a ' set ' of golf clubs is restricted to no more than 14 clubs . __eou__ Then what makes a ' set ' of clubs ? __eou__ In general , a set of golf clubs 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , PW ; Woods : 1 , 3 , 5 and a putter . __eou__ So many ? __eou__ This is not to say you have to carry all of these clubs . It depends on your preferences . __eou__ Have you heard of Tiger Woods ? __eou__ Of course even people who don't know anything about golf know his name . __eou__
Do you have any plans for Veteran ’ s Day ? __eou__ You mean Armistice Day . __eou__ Well , as you know , on November 11th the allies signed a peace treaty with the Germans , also known as the Armistice Treaty . This marked the end of WWI and many countries around the world commemorate this date under names such as Remembers ’ Day . In Poland it ’ s their independence day ! There ’ s a lot going on around the world on this day . __eou__ Wow , I didn ’ t know ! Probably because I flunked history in school . __eou__
Hey , look ! They ’ re playing reruns of the 1996 Olympics . __eou__ Isn ’ t that Michael Johnson ?

He won four golds , didn ’ t he ? __eou__ Carl won the gold in the 100 , 200 , long jump , and 4x100 relay in 1984 . __eou__ I like the way Carl runs . He looks more graceful . __eou__
Is it true that one of our competitors is planning to launch their tracking service next month ? __eou__ That would be WebTracker . We're heard they're almost ready . That's why we have to finish first . __eou__ Or they'll take over the market before we even get started . __eou__ Right . And that would be a total giga-bummer . __eou__ I guess we'd better get back to work . __eou__

That's why it's called the moon cake and the moon cake symbolizes family reunion and harmony . __eou__ Sounds very interesting . I'll buy some to family people . __eou__ All the moon cakes are generally classified into two styles , Cantonese style and Suzhou style . __eou__ What's the difference between these two styles ? __eou__ The skin of Cantonese style cakes is soft and puffy with heavy stuffing while the skin of Suzhou style cakes is puffy filled with fragrant nuts . __eou__ Get me some of each . __eou__ OK , here you are . __eou__

Look , here it says that the CD-ROM is built-in ! __eou__ What other features are listed ? __eou__ It says that it comes in teal and tangerine . __eou__ Totally cool colors ! __eou__ And it says that it sleeps . __eou__
You have drank dozens of cups . You are bound to get a bay window . __eou__ Thank you , but I am in a terrible mood indeed . __eou__

Where do you want to go this weekend ? __eou__ Let's go to the lake and camp on the south side . __eou__ Do you want to take the jet ski ? __eou__ Let's just rent one this time . The AC is broken in the truck , remember ? __eou__ Oh , that's right . Renting is good ! __eou__ Should we call the Olsen's and ask them if they want to join us ? __eou__ Okay , you call them . __eou__ Then you go out to the garage and check out the camping gear . __eou__
What's your ideal boss ? __eou__ I have had an incredible boss , who was my direct supervisor during the last year of my coop work experience . A-bout two months after I began working for her , she really let me spread my wings . She encouraged me to work independently , because she said she had come to trust my judgment and commitment . So I was able to move forward on projects without having to check in with her every day . Of course , I made certain that she knew what I had accomplished on a daily and weekly basis because I gave her summary reports , although she didn't specifically ask me to . Without her support and encouragement , I don't think I would have felt confident enough to have written up a proposal suggesting that the department change a process that had been in place for a long time . But she was open to suggestions , so long as employees could back them up with research and facts . When I submitted my suggestion , she reviewed it and told me where she thought it needed more work . She then took my revised proposal to her boss . He was a more conservative type , but she lobbied him to try It for several weeks . He did , and it was so successful that it was instituted as a permanent change . I've also worked for some very difficult bosses in summer and part-time jobs . And while I'd certainly prefer to work for one like I've just described , I'm the kind of person who can get along with just about anyone . __eou__
What did you usually do as a head nurse ? __eou__ I allocate different patients with their consent to different nurses . And I supervise the primary nurses and help nurses carry out their work . __eou__ How to maintain a high standard of nursing ? __eou__ To maintain a high standard of nursing , we should take experience and education into consideration while considering a nurse's level of expertise in caring for various patients . __eou__
How were you getting along with your studies ? __eou__ Quite well . I made good records in college . I won the scholarship in every semester . __eou__ In addition to your major , did you have other fields to study ? __eou__ Yes , I had taken finance courses in a training school . Compound talents are needed in the society and I must study continually to keep abreast with the times . __eou__
Here is your spicy diced chicken with peanuts , sir . __eou__ Thank you . It looks very attractive . __eou__ I would advise you to enjoy the dish while it is hot . __eou__ Tasty and tender ! It must be one of the famous local dishes . __eou__ Yes . It's a traditional dish . __eou__ And it must be very particular in cooking . __eou__ You are right , sir . To prepare it , a Sichuan food chef first fries some chilli until they turn reddish brown , and then puts diced chicken breast meat into the pot with other condiments and peanuts . That's why the dish has a bright colour . __eou__ I see . __eou__ Enjoy yourself , sir . __eou__
I've never met anyone like Clyde before . __eou__ He's such a buppie-a black yuppie . Black people come in all shapes and sizes . Just check out the party . __eou__ Wow ! There are so many different people here . I expected mostly athletes and rappers . __eou__ You'll find some of those here , too . But not if you don't shake it up ! There's an African saying , “ If you can talk , you can sing ! If you can walk , you can dance ! ” __eou__ Then I'll just shut up and sit down ! __eou__
Cool camera . What are its features ? __eou__ It's loaded ! For example , it's got a 256 color , LCD screen that rotates 360 degrees , and switches to black and white in power save mode . Also , it has a low-light mode for night shooting and touch screen menu controls that are really convenient . __eou__ What about the quality of the pictures ? __eou__ Oh , it's the usual 5600x3200 resolution with 10.0 megapixels . It's got a 5xzoom , so from 28mm to 120mm the pictures look great ! I can change the resolution , too . __eou__ Wow ! What about the memory ? __eou__ It has a built-in hard-wired memory , but I like to use the 64MB media cards that come with it . I can download everything onto the hard drive and then edit and enhance with different software . It takes fantastic pictures that I can either print out or E-mail to my friends . __eou__
I think I found my Yankee's mug ... __eou__ Oh , great . Where was it ? __eou__ It fell out of the garbage bag . __eou__ What was it doing there ? __eou__ It was with all the other dishes from dinner . __eou__ You mean Johnny threw out all the dinnerware ? __eou__ I think our son was trying to pull a fast one on us . __eou__
Excuse me . I'm afraid you're in my seat . You've moved my books . __eou__ Oh , dear . __eou__ You must have realized somebody was here . __eou__ Oh , well , I looked around . There wasn't any other space . I waited a while and nobody came . I'm sorry if I've taken your place . __eou__
You saved my life yesterday , Rachel . I can't believe I forgot to bring my wallet when we went to lunch with those clients . __eou__ It was a good thing I had enough on me . __eou__ Let me buy you lunch today to pay you back . __eou__
Do you know that the dolphin is the most intelligent animal in the world ? __eou__ Yes . Dolphins have a big brain and they are very smart . They are also the fastest swimmers in the world . __eou__ They must be amazing animals . __eou__ They are . I read a story about a dolphin saving a A from drowning in the sea . __eou__ I read that story too . They seem to be able to understand men . __eou__ They sure can . Maybe they can interact with men better than monkeys and apes . __eou__
I can't believe you wear jeans to the office ! Are you trying to lose your job ? __eou__ Of course not . I'm just observing casual day . On Fridays , the company doesn't require us to wear formal business attire . __eou__ Wow ! Nobody told me about that . Won't the relaxed dress code damage the company image ? __eou__ We don't think so . Casual days are becoming more common , and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes . __eou__ I guess it lets people express their individual tastes . But won't some people abuse it ? __eou__ Not really . Besides , there is a separate dress code for casual day . People can't just wear whatever they want . __eou__ It seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity . __eou__ Believe it or not , it has the opposite effect . Employees are actually more productive on casual days . __eou__
Sue ? Do you want to join the softball team ? We need another player . __eou__ I haven ’ t played softball since I was in high school ! __eou__ Come on ! It ’ ll be fun . We play every other Saturday afternoon from May until August . __eou__ Okay . I guess I could give it a try . __eou__
Help ! Help ! __eou__ What's the trouble , ma'am ? __eou__ I was taking a walk when a young man came at me from nowhere and snatched the bag off my hands and ran away . __eou__ What did the young man look like ? __eou__ Well , he's young , tall and thin . __eou__ To which direction did he run ? __eou__ Let me see ... my right arm ... oh , to the east . __eou__
Solomon , I thought we had agreed to change this deadline . __eou__ I wanted to talk to you about that , Mr . Eng . Mr . Emory would prefer to keep the deadline as is . We can start earlier if you ’ d like . __eou__ I ’ ll have to think about that , Ms . Solomon . __eou__ Certainly , sir . We can wait another day or two . __eou__
Here are the leads from last week's exhibit as a trade show . There are about forty or so that are hot . You should contact them immediately , in the next twenty-four hours if you can . The rest are categorized according to potential and interest.You can see we've got our hot stack , our warm stack , our lukewarm , and our cold but not dead stack . __eou__ Haha ... please don't tell me you've got a dead stack . I hate making cold calls ... __eou__ Don't worry , most of the leads on mildly interested , if not strongly interested . We've just got to make sure the Hot ones are contacted right away . And even the contacts that for what ever reason aren't prepared to make an order now , they might be interested in the future . Please be conscanciouss about getting a hold of everyone of these leads . We've spent a big chunk of marketing budget to find these people . I don't want our investment to go down the drain . __eou__ Don't worry , I've gotchy covered . __eou__
What type of people do you work with most effectively ? __eou__ I tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward.It ' s more difficult for me to be around timid people , because I move quickly and I am decisive . __eou__ What things impress you in your colleagues ? __eou__ I admire and work best with people who are of good character and integrity . I also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment . __eou__ What are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ? __eou__ The only thing I really don't like is to get feedback in front of others . I want to hear good and bad feedback in private , so that I have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions . I believe that's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior . __eou__ How do you organize and plan for major projects ? __eou__ I love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario.Then , I set a timetable that's realistic.What I usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because I've already visualized what could happen and how I'd react . __eou__ Describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure . __eou__ I had to complete an end of quarter report once while I was on the road for two consecutive weeks.The amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible , because I could't bring my office files with me.Luckily I had a great secretary and a logical filling system , so we located everything we needed . __eou__ How do you manage your time in a typical day ? __eou__ I've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk / return value.The last thing I do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which I take care of at the end of the day or week . __eou__ Describe a time when you acted on someone's suggestion . __eou__ I changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings . __eou__
Next please . __eou__ I want to send this letter to the US by airmail . __eou__ That'll be five yuan forty , please . __eou__

I was just thinking to call you , then the phone rang and it was you calling me . __eou__ Great minds think alike . __eou__
Yesterday I read hamlet.such a fantastic book ! __eou__ You said it.No one can match Shakespeare in artistic talent . __eou__ I do agree with you . __eou__
What should I prepare for the recruitment fair ? __eou__ You should wear a formal dress and be confident . __eou__ What application materials should I take ? __eou__ You should take several resumes and some copies of your graduate diploma . __eou__
What is your most preferred training method ? __eou__ Well , I prefer active rather than passive training . For example , I like the training offered by a financial software company from which we bought the newest updated virgin . They sent the programmers to demonstrate how to do and then ask us to practice . All employees receiving this training were in the same meeting room , so we could communicate with each other . We had a lot of fun learning together . It helps to build up the work relation among colleagues . __eou__ Well , that is also very efficient , right ? __eou__ Of course , it is much better than just giving us some reading materials or information via the internet . __eou__ That ’ s boring . Once we were asked to watch a video on how to operate the punches , all of us seemed to fall into sleep by the end of the video . __eou__
Do you want to sign for a Korea language class ? __eou__ What for ? Oh , I see , you mean next year our company will expand business to the South Korea market . __eou__ Right , we have located a business partner in Seoul . The first contact proves to be successful . The general manager of South Korean company has scheduled to pay a visit to us next month . I think it is quite possible to set up a joint venture company with them soon . __eou__ Well , sounds promising . But I think our company will provide us with the language training courses if it is necessary . We need not bother signing for the language by ourselves . __eou__ A slow sparrow should make an early start . You know , I am not quick at learning any language . __eou__
What can I do for you , sir ? __eou__ I'd like to choose one game for myself and one for my younger sister . __eou__ What kind of games do you like ? __eou__ Big games of course . __eou__ I see , but games are played in different ways . I'm wondering what type of games do you like to play ? __eou__ Type ? I don't know , what do you have ? __eou__ Basically , there are 7 types of games __eou__ Well , I am a beginner . I ... __eou__ Don't worry . Most male customers choose first person shooting , real time strategy , action or sports , while female customers prefer simulating , action or role playing . Shooting , action and sports games require flexible movements and real time strategy usually needs overall consideration . __eou__ I like first person shooting and action more than other types of games . __eou__ If so , counter Strike and Might & Magic are good alternatives . Counter Strike is one of the hottest shooting games and Might & Magic series are popular among girls because the game has attractive plot and interesting scenes . __eou__ Oh , thanks a lot . Then , I will take the two . __eou__ Do you want the latest editions ? If your computer runs fast , I think the latest editions are better because although old editions are cheaper , they are less exciting and attractive . __eou__ I will have the latest editions . __eou__
Hello Mrs Parker , how have you been ? __eou__ Hello Dr Peters . Just fine thank you . Ricky and I are here for his vaccines . __eou__ Very well . Let's see , according to his vaccination record , Ricky has received his Polio , Tetanus and Hepatitis B shots . He is 14 months old , so he is due for Hepatitis A , Chickenpox and Measles shots . __eou__ What about Rubella and Mumps ? __eou__ Well , I can only give him these for now , and after a couple of weeks I can administer the rest . __eou__ OK , great . Doctor , I think I also may need a Tetanus booster . Last time I got it was maybe fifteen years ago ! __eou__ We will check our records and I'll have the nurse administer and the booster as well . Now , please hold Ricky's arm tight , this may sting a little . __eou__
Li Lei , can you tell me what the origin of Easter is ? __eou__ The Bible says that Jesus Christ was resurrected three days after he was crucified . People commemorate that at a festival called Easter . __eou__ Oh , then when do you celebrate Easter ? __eou__ We celebrate it on the first Sunday after a full moon on or after the 21st of March . __eou__ How do you celebrate it ? __eou__ We make a lot of Easter eggs and then paint some designs on them . We'll also go to church and pray . __eou__ That sounds interesting . __eou__
What is the most unexpected thing you experienced in space ? __eou__ I wasn't quite prepared for the view of the Earth as we left . It was just awe-inspiring . It emerged from just a slightly curved horizon to a whole Earth , where you could look across oceans and continents in a single glance . I wasn't quite prepared for that . It's inevitably etched in my memory . __eou__ When viewing the Earth from space , do you feel detached from humanity or more a part of the totality of humankind ? __eou__ Detached . You're literally detached from one planet , captured by another . Your only link to reality is the Earth out there ; fortunate - 1y , it stays in view the whole time . __eou__ There're a lot of suspicions that the International Space Station is never going to become reality . Is it going to be some future project that never happens ? __eou__ I believe it's certainly for real . It without question has suffered a lot of delays . But there's hardware sitting on the pad right now and it's due to go off in December . It is a reality . It has just taken longer to get literally off the ground . __eou__ There were a lot of talks during the Bush administration about a not too distant future Mars mission . It seemed to fizzle out . Do you think that this Shuttle mission will reignite the public's passion for space and get us to Mars sooner ? __eou__ I hope this flight is not just a one-time affair , that it does re-ignite people's interest to push on . But only time will tell . __eou__ You had gone to the moon twice , orbited space around the Earth lots of times , and of course you have had the most amazing views that a human being can have . How long do we ordinary beings have to wait to feel the weightlessness ? I just can't wait . __eou__ If I were the man making the decisions , you could get in line tomorrow . I strongly support ordinary people going into space . Unfortunately , I don't think it will be in the near future . __eou__
Do you believe in horoscope fortune-telling ? __eou__ I used to be an atheist . But in recent months , I couldn't but form a more favorable opinion of horoscope . __eou__ That sounds interesting . Have you been involved in any mystery ? __eou__ Not exactly , except that I find horoscope predictions increasingly accurate . I came upon a website which sends me an up-dated message by e-mail each day forecasting my experience in detail . It is amazing to find these forecasts largely in line with my daily life . __eou__ What did it say about you then ? __eou__ For example , the message for the day before yesterday notified me that I , as a Leo guy , was to have some " unusual experience in food and drink . And as it turned out , the reality matched this prediction well . Lasi night , I was treated to a dinner party by Mr . Lee . __eou__ But it must have been only a coincidence . That's the only way superstition wins over science . __eou__ Oh , no . You can never tell whether such-and-such is science or sheer fraud.If horoscope is really something deceptive , how come quite a size of proportion of young people think highly of it . __eou__ For fun . It serves as a shared topic to them.While they claim to consult the predictions constantly and marvel at their " accuracy ' . they do not necessarily take them seriously . When it that these predictions are matched by their real-life experiences , they delight in spreading the thrill with friends . But if there isn't any correlation between reality and predictions , they just grin , forget about them , and go on living as usual . __eou__
Hey , Zina . You're here early today . __eou__ Yeah , I'm going to be making phone calls all day . What a blast . __eou__ I just wanted to say thanks for putting us on the map so fast . I appreciate it . __eou__ Save it , Vince . After I put my first million in the bank , I'll say you're welcome . __eou__ Fair enough.Keep up the good work . __eou__
Which church do you attend ? __eou__ I am Mormon , so I go to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints . __eou__ What ’ s the difference between this and other Churches ? __eou__ Mormons believe that , after the death of Christ and the death of the Apostles 10 , their church Christ founded became corrupt and the authority of Christ on earth was lost to men . In 1830 , a prophet named Joseph Smith was brought up by God to restore the church . __eou__ Then does that mean the other churches are corrupt ? __eou__ That means that they all have parts of the original gospel , but not all . __eou__ Do you believe that Mormons have all of it ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Why do you really go to church ? __eou__ We gather together to encourage each other , because we have common beliefs . We come together and call it church . __eou__
John , I'd like to see you in my office for a minute . __eou__ Yes , sir , I'll be there in just a moment . __eou__ John , I have been watching you . I've been paying attention to you over the last quarter and I'm impressed . You've done a tremendous job in tackling some difficult accounts . I just want to let you to know , after this month's performance reviews , I'm recommending you for promotion . __eou__ Gosh sir , thank you , sir ! I had no idea there were any positions opening up in our department . __eou__ Well , it's not going to be in our department . I've recommended you for an interdepartmental transfer . There's supervisory spot opening up in financial . I'm turning your name in for it . __eou__ Management ? Wow , I had no idea I could move so quickly from entry level to managerial staff . __eou__ You've earned it . __eou__
Thank you for agreeing to come in and meet with us today . __eou__ Thank you for inviting me . __eou__ I can see from your resume you were in charge of sales for Corporate World Unlimited from 1997 to 1999 . Can you please tell me about your responsibilities ? __eou__ Yes . I was in charge of profit and loss for the northwest region of Canada . As a manager , I was directly responsible for a 50 % increase in sales over a four-month period . __eou__ What , do you believe , are some of the key attributes that helped you to achieve such an outstanding increase in sales ? __eou__ I believe persistence and perseverance are key attributes . __eou__
Mom , will you tuck me in tonight ? __eou__ Sure , honey . I'll read you a bed time story , too . __eou__ I hope I don't have any nightmares tonight . __eou__ Don't worry , you'll sleep well tonight . __eou__ Thanks for tucking me , Mom . __eou__

How's your new apartment ? __eou__ I thought it was in a quiet neighborhood , but it isn't . __eou__ What's wrong ? __eou__ One of my neighbors has a dog . __eou__ Does it make a lot of noise ? __eou__ It barks all night long . __eou__
How about the matter ? __eou__ I heard it has been finally settled under the rose . __eou__ It ’ s the only way to preserve her reputation . __eou__ Yeah , fortunately it did not cause a disaster . __eou__
Has the chief accepted our plan ? __eou__ Not yet . I guess we should send Jim along to talk to the chief since he is such an apple polisher . I am sure he can help . __eou__ Let ’ s have a try . __eou__
Crossed cousin marriage is not allowed in China . __eou__ It it true of many countries . __eou__ You know why ? __eou__ Sure . If people are near in blood , they might pass on some genetic disease to the next generation . __eou__
Fairly warm this morning , isn't it ? __eou__ You're right.The air is so warm and everything looks so fresh and green . __eou__ Say , how about a walk along the river ? __eou__ Marvelous idea ? __eou__
I'm not really accustomed to the style of the new boss . __eou__ It'll take us all some time to get used to the change . __eou__
Sorry . The car breaks down and it needs to be repaired . __eou__ Knock on wood . But I have a very important date . __eou__
Do you know how happy I am ? The Ant Kingdom is a perfect world with colorful fairy tales . It seems like the air is fresh here . __eou__ Just kids like that . __eou__ Come on baby , stop trying to pretend like a man . If you go there , you are sure to like them . __eou__ Hurry up ! Hurry up ! What lovely caterpillars are over there ! __eou__ I said you are sure to like them . There is the Grand Parade Of Ants Carnival in a few minutes in the square . You will experience a dream of fantasy . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ All kinds of insects dress themselves up . They drive straight their own Flower Cars along the Parade Avenue of Ants Kingdom . __eou__ That's splendid . Can you take three pictures of me with them ? __eou__ I thought you had grown out of such child practices . __eou__ Cut it out . Look at my smile , and it seems like the flowers in the spring . Right ? __eou__ Gross ! __eou__ Hurry up ! The smile is frozen on my face . __eou__
I just got a telegram from Margaret and Greg . __eou__ Are they coming to Chicago again ? __eou__ Yes . They ’ re coming the beginning of August . __eou__ Oh , good ! We can all get together again . __eou__ I ’ m glad they ’ re coming in August . Maybe Greg and I can play some golf or get tickets to a baseball game . __eou__ And Margaret and I can take the dog and go jogging in the park . __eou__ Remember the garden party they gave when we were in England ? __eou__ Oh , yes . We all sat on the grass , and Margaret played the guitar and sang Greek songs . __eou__ I had a great time . It ’ ll be good to see them again . __eou__
What should I do if I notice a fire ? __eou__ Raise the alarm by breaking the glass of the nearest fire alarm . Call Security , say ' Fire ' and give your name and exact location . At night you should phone the fire service from the nearest telephone . __eou__ Should I try to put the fire out ? __eou__ If you discover a small fire , you can try to put it out with a fire extinguisher but only do this if you have been trained . Make sure you use the right extinguisher . They are all colour-coded and contain different substances to put out the fire . __eou__
What arrangement will you make about payment ? __eou__ We shall open an irrevocable L / C to cover our shipment from Shanghai to Hamburg . Is it at sight or after sight ? __eou__ At sight of course . __eou__ Some customers demand that 80 % of the credit amount be paid at sight , and the rest be paid after the machines are proved satisfactory on trial . __eou__ I am afraid that can't be done . We have never done business on such terms . __eou__ But such terms are quite common in the machinery trade . Other suppliers are offering better terms . Some even allow payment 60days after sight . __eou__ We ask for full payment at sight , because we guarantee 90 % mechanical efficiency for all our products . You don't have the same guarantee from other suppliers . The usual percentage is around 85 . __eou__ That's true . I'm eager to know if you could send some fitters to ensure good operation . __eou__ Yes . We usually send technicians abroad to offer after-sales service to our customers . __eou__ If you send fitters along with the machines to ensure that all the machines run properly , and if you provide after-sales service , we agree to make the payment in full . __eou__ Thank you . I am glad we have come to an agreement at last . __eou__
That is the most beautiful sunset ! __eou__ Let's stop the car and enjoy it for a minute . __eou__ Here is a good place . Let's get out . __eou__ Wow .

The sun is almost gone and yet there is still color everywhere ! __eou__ Where is our camera ? Let's see if we can catch this on film ! __eou__
I hate landing in the sand trap ! Now I'm probably going to waste strokes getting it out . __eou__ At least you haven't landed in the water yet . I've done that on the last two holes . __eou__ Could you hand me my wedge ? I'll try ... __eou__ Here you go . I'll wait for you to get on the green before I putt . __eou__ No . you go ahead and putt it out . Then I'Il go . __eou__ No way , Mary . I'm going to let you go first . I don't want the pressure of putting first . __eou__
I don't know if you remember , but with honest every day last year we tided the knot . __eou__ Of course I remember , actually , I am very surprised you remembered , I thought for sure you would forget . __eou__ How could I ever forget ? I even bought you roses because I love you . __eou__ They are so beautiful . I love them , and I love you too . __eou__ You are more beautiful than the roses . __eou__ I don't know how , but I love you more than the day we gotta married . __eou__ Yes , we are match made in heaven . __eou__ I know of the past years we have faced and shared troubles , but we survived and here we are . __eou__ Yes , we did , we did have problems , but we shared a lot of happiness too .

Does tea-serving follow any special etiquette in China ? Each time I dropped in at my Chinese friends ' homes , their parents would offer me a cup of hot , strong tea , though they never inquired of me about whether I want it . __eou__ You've got a point there . It is a custom and good manners to serve tea to a guest who comes to pay a visit . There is no need to ask if he needs it or not , or if he wants something else . It might be an insult to the guest if he is left sitting there without being served tea . __eou__ So the guest is presumed to be thirsty and in need of some drink after the trip . In that case , I guess , in return , the guest doesn't have to drink it if he wouldn't like it . __eou__ It wouldn't be considered rude behavior if he doesn't even take a single drop . But he'd better receive the teacup with both hands and bow his thanks when the cup is brought before his face . When the host pours hot water into his cup , he may also choose to tap his index finger on the table , meaning " Thanks " . No matter if he likes it or not , it is impolite if he doesn't even lay a finger on the cup . __eou__ So next time , I'd better take a few sips , to ' save face ' at least , right ? __eou__ Sure . The guest is welcomed by being served tea . But if after chatting for a while , the host asks servants or family members to serve a new cup of tea , or add some hot water , he is giving another signal . __eou__ What does that imply , then ? __eou__ More often than not , the understatement is ' I'm afraid it's time you leave ' . __eou__
So what are you doing for Thanksgiving ? __eou__ Not much really . It's more of an American tradition , so back home we don't really celebrate it . In fact , I am not even sure of what exactly is being celebrated ! __eou__ Well you know , it's a time to get together with all your family and be thankful for everything ! __eou__ Yeah but , how did this holiday come to be ? __eou__ Well , the first settlers of Massachusetts arrived there because of religious persecution from England and King James . Once in the New World , they befriended an native named Squanto , who taught them how to harvest food from the area such as corn . __eou__ And then what did happen ? __eou__ Well , they had enough harvests for the next winter and celebration 。 They decided to have a big feast for the natives , giving thanks the land , and everyone for the foods , healthy and new lives . __eou__ Interesting ! I am amazed how big and delicious thanksgiving dinners are ! __eou__ Come to my house for Thanksgiving ! We are having turkey , pumpkin pie , mashed potatoes with gravy , and lots of stuffing ! __eou__ Count me in ! __eou__
Have you every belonged to a political party ? __eou__ No , I haven ’ t , but I thought about joining the green party . __eou__ Really ? I know you are very concerned about the environment . You were a member of the pressure group Greenpeace , weren ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes . I was . But I didn ’ t have enough time to devote to it . __eou__ The green party have no chance of winning an election . The other parties are too big and popular . __eou__ You ’ re right . But smaller political and pressure groups can often influence large political parties . Any member of parliament can propose legislation and parties and pressure groups can raise awareness __eou__ Most people are not very politically aware . They often don ’ t understand the issues fully . __eou__ That ’ s true . But it ’ s a little strange because the media often reports on political events . You can read about them in newspaper or hear them on tv . __eou__
Hello . __eou__ Good morning , Ruth . Did I wake you up ? __eou__ No , I was just about to get up . What's up , Carl ? __eou__ Listen , I am calling to confirm what you said yesterday . Are we supposed to meet at the Chinatown terminal of the Avenue B bus or D bus ? __eou__ B as in boy . You should get off at the last stop in Chinatown . __eou__ Oh , you mean Canal Street ? __eou__ That's the wrong direction . Canal Street is on the other side of Chinatown . __eou__ Oh , I get it . When did we decide to meet ? __eou__ At 10,45 . Is Ann coming along ? __eou__ I cannot get hold of her yet . __eou__ See you around , Carl . __eou__ See you later . __eou__
I've heard of ground-level ozone but can you explain what it is exactly ? __eou__ Yes , it's one of the main air pollutants . Factories don't emit it directly into the air . It's actually formed when nitrogen oxides and VOC emissions come into contact with heat and sunlight . __eou__ Sorry ? What does VOC stand for ? __eou__ Oh , Vous are ' volatile organic compounds ' . That's a technical term for solvents or other chemicals found in things like paint . __eou__ So , what damage does ozone do to the environment ? __eou__ Well , it can cause smog , which can affect people's health - especially people with breathing difficulties . __eou__

Chen is an honest , hardworking and responsible man who deeply cares for his family and friends . __eou__ What personality traits do you admire ? __eou__ Honest , flexible and easy-going . __eou__ What leadership qualities did you develop as an administrative personnel ? __eou__ I feel that learning how to motivate people and to work together as a team will be the major goal of my leadership . __eou__ How do you normally handle criticism ? __eou__ Silence is golden . Just don't say anything ; otherwise the situation could become worse . I do , however , accept constructive criticism . __eou__ What do you find frustrating in a work situation ? __eou__ Sometimes , the narrow-minded people make me frustrated . __eou__ How do you handle your conflict with your colleagues in your work ? __eou__ I will try to present my ideas in a more clear and civilized manner in order to get my points across . __eou__ To secure employment hopefully with your company . __eou__ How long would you like to stay with this company ? __eou__ I will stay as long as I can continue to learn and to grow in my field . __eou__
Hey , Mary . We're back . Have you eaten yet ? __eou__ I had some bread for breakfast . __eou__ Let's go out for brunch . __eou__ Brunch ? __eou__ It is a meal that combines breakfast and lunch . On Sundays , many Americans sleep late and go out for brunch . Those who go to church without having breakfast have brunch also . __eou__ Actually , many Taiwanese wake up late on Sunday mornings , too . It may be a good idea for them to eat brunch instead of eating breakfast and lunch . __eou__
I think you're being a little naive . __eou__ If I want , I can protect myself by paying through an escrow account , which holds the money until I receive the item . __eou__ That proves my point !

They had to give me 3 shoots . __eou__ Well , I guess you've learned a good lesson , huh . You have to take good care of your teeth . __eou__ No kidding . Not only can ’ t I stand the pain , but man ... dentists are expensive . The bill is going to be humungous ! __eou__ Don't you have a dental insurance ? __eou__ I do , but it still does not cover everything . __eou__

And you ? __eou__ I've been learning Japanese every evening . __eou__ Why have you been learning Japanese ? Why not English ? __eou__ I hope to visit Japan next year . __eou__ Well , we'll both have to start learning all the new dances . __eou__ Yes , let's go into the dance-hall and ask if we can take dancing-lessons . __eou__ A good idea . They can teach elephants to dance nowadays perhaps there's hope for us ! __eou__

Something terrible and unexpected that made it impossible for him to ... what if he showed up , took one look at me and left ? __eou__ Not possible . __eou__ Maybe , there was a subway accident . __eou__ Absolutely . __eou__ A train got trapped underground with him inside . __eou__ And no phone . __eou__ And you know , how those express trains create suction . __eou__
I can't believe Mr . Fro didn't buy it . Who does that guy think he is anyway ? Bill Gates ? __eou__ He had a lot of nerve telling us our ads sucked . __eou__ Time to order .

Even if our company didn't have a dress code , I still think people would wear formal clothing to work . __eou__ I wouldn't be so sure ... People want to wear what they feel most comfortable in . __eou__ Maybe that's true for some positions , but I think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree . They dress for success ! You can't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans . It's just not respectful to you client . __eou__ I think what you wear is so overrated . I would rather have a down-to-earth , honest and solid sales person than a painted , patent leather , designer suite salesman . __eou__ It's not as simple as that . People judge you by your appearance , whether you like it or not . So dressing professional is being professional . The image that you portray to others is so important in business . It's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale . __eou__ Maybe you're right , but I'll take my sneakers and jeans any day ! __eou__

The workshop topic was resolving personal problems . It was led by a professional human resources director . The teacher had a lot of experience , and I think we were all given a really good base to start with . __eou__ The workshop was only one afternoon long , do you really think you can learn that much in only a couple of hours ? __eou__ It depends on the topic , the teacher , and the way the course is set up . Yesterday , even though we only had a short time to discuss the issues , the workshop got us all thinking . We learned some very basic , but very useful methods of dealing with personnel issues . __eou__ Sounds like you really learned a lot . __eou__ I did ... I just hope I can implement all these great ideas that we shared . __eou__
My Buddha ! ! It's beautiful ! But I thought you were afraid ? __eou__ Actually , I was watching your auction all along .

Welcome to our show ! Today , I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich ! Are you ready ? Let ’ s get started ! __eou__ Let ’ s start with the basics , bread . Bread is an important ingredient here . You need to remember one thing - choose the bread according to the following criteria , freshness , crumb and color . If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven , or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color . __eou__ Now that our bread is ready , let ’ s talk about the ingredients ! Of course , each person ’ s palate is different , but I ’ m going to give you a few tips that you ’ ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich . I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich . __eou__ Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light . The best choices here are evident — cucumbers , tomatoes , onions , sweet pepper or chilli , lettuce and , of course , herbs — you can ’ t go wrong with them . As for aubergines , mushrooms and asparagus , I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil . __eou__ Last but not least , we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich . We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper , or we can combine mustard sauce , mayonnaise , ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor ! It ’ s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt ! __eou__ That ’ s all the time we have for today , but join us next time where we ’ ll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna ! Till next time ! __eou__

I wonder if I can see your mother , little boy . Is she engaged ? __eou__ Engaged ? She ’ s married . __eou__ Johnny , I wish you ’ d stop reaching for things . Haven ’ t you a tongue ? __eou__ Yes , Mother , but my arm is longer . __eou__
Hi , Bill . Are you going to the commencement ? __eou__ Yes . Do you want to go with me ? __eou__ OK . ( Several minutes later . ) Let's go into the school auditorium . __eou__ Now that take this seat . Do you see those piles of red diplomas on the desks on the stage ? __eou__ Yes . I find my heart is now rising and falling like waves , all sorts of feelings welling up in my heart . __eou__ That's true . Four years ' trails and hardships , joys and sorrows of life are gushing out to my mind all together . I can hardly tell whether I am joyful or gloomy at the moment when I am about to leave the campus and to start a new stage of my life . __eou__ How time flies . Look , the president of the college has come onto the stage . __eou__ He's going to make the opening speech . __eou__
Hi ! Dick . Where are you going ? You're in such a hurry . __eou__ Playground . We're having sports for today's outside class activities . All my classmates have already got there . __eou__ What are you going to play ? __eou__ Some of us will play basketball and some volleyball . __eou__ Enjoy yourself . __eou__
Did you see May today ? __eou__ Yes , but why does she have such a long face ? __eou__ I don't have the foggiest idea . __eou__ I thought she'd be happy . __eou__ Yeah , especially since she got a promotion recently . __eou__ I don't know . Maybe it ’ s some kind of personal problem . __eou__
What did the doctor say ? __eou__ He said that I have been eating too much . __eou__ Did he give you any advice ? __eou__ Yes , he asked me to clean up my diet by cutting red meat . __eou__ Yes , you must put yourself on a diet . __eou__
What places does the tour include ? __eou__ You will visit the Hyde Park , Poet's Corner , Tower of London , Fleet Street and Tower Bridge . __eou__ So many places I have been looking forward to . We will take part in the group . __eou__ I think you will enjoy your journey . __eou__
You look bright-eyed and bushy-tailed . __eou__ Of course , just five minutes ago I got the phone call from Future Clothes Company and I was told to start my trial period in that company next Monday . __eou__ Congratulations ! Let's get together sometime . __eou__ Great idea . __eou__ Well , I am worried to death right now ! There is still no news from the company for me . __eou__ Let it be ! Time will tell . __eou__ Maybe they will send me e-mail to inform the result . Let me check my mail-box again . __eou__
Now that you have learned Kung fu for a few months , what are your general impression of it ? __eou__ I think , maybe , it takes a real Kung fu master to give a more fair assessment ; meanwhile , I am no more than a beginner . But I really doubt whether kung fu would be of any great help when it comes to defending oneself in real life . __eou__ You mean , kung fu may not be so powerful as it is imagined ? To some extent your idea holds water . Kung fu was originally intended for self-defense , but with time it became something more than defense skills . Now we are apt to treat it as an art . __eou__ An art ! You have a good point there . So it is called martial arts in English . The Chinese are really capable of doing things nicely . They even made fighting a great enjoyment , so marvelous and fascinating . __eou__ Thanks for your compliment ! Perhaps the Chinese culture as a whole has a special inclination towards aesthetics . Do you know Jin Yong ? __eou__ I know he is a martial arts fiction writer . But I've read none of his novels . __eou__ All of his works have been translated into English . I recommend you to read one or two works of his . You'll get a general glimpse into Chinese kung fu culture . When you go through the pages , you are likely to feel they are not about kung fu alone , but cover all walks of life . __eou__ I see . They must have incorporated a series of Chinese cultural elements . __eou__ Yes , take philosophy , for instance . What makes a true , respectable da via , or a warrior hero ? It's not enough only to be formidable . It also involves a man's character , sense of justice , and values of life . __eou__ So kung fu is also a means of self-cultivation , isn't it ? __eou__ Indeed , you're exactly right ! __eou__
Thank you for coming tonight , Mrs . Webber . As a teacher , it's great seeing the kid's parents assist our parent-teacher conference night . __eou__ Of course ! I am very interested to know how my child is doing and also get some insight from you as to how he can improve . __eou__ Well Allen is a great student . He is a hard worker and very well behaved , however he does struggle a bit with math . __eou__ I guess he gets that from me , I never did well in math when I was a kid . What can I do at home to compliment what he is learning in the classroom . __eou__ Well , it's important that you sit with him and review his homework assignments and help him with math . I would also recommend he stay after school twice a week for tutoring sessions . It will really help a lot . __eou__ Thanks a lot ! I will definitely do that . Is there anything else ? __eou__ Um ... yes . Here is a notice from our financial department , seems your child's Tumion is overdue . __eou__ Oh yes , I ... __eou__
I hear Yolanda has been studying every night this week for the exam . __eou__ That's good , but I think it's too late . She hasn't studied all semester , and I doubt she can catch up in one week . __eou__
I am so bored all day . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Jack borrowed a large sum of money from me and didn ’ t pay me back . __eou__ Don ’ t make a mountain out of molehill . I am sure he will do that on his payday . __eou__
Hey , Bob . Are you getting the feeling you've been here before ? __eou__ Yes , I'm sure I've been here before . __eou__ Maybe we're walking in circles . __eou__ Yes , there's that bar we passed an hour ago . __eou__
You always stick to your PC recently . Are you still fascinated by chatting on line ? __eou__ For me , the times of chatting online has gone . __eou__ What the hell are you doing now ? __eou__ I opened my blog today . In order to have more visitors , I have to land on others ' blogs and leave my messages for their blogs . __eou__ What's new with you ? __eou__ Do you still remember Justin ? __eou__ Of course , he was our monitor in college . How is him now ? __eou__ He seemed to be dumped by his girlfriend . I found his blogs were a little sad . __eou__ Let me see . What a moving poem ! __eou__
What colour is her hair ? __eou__ Oh , blonde , she's very blonde ... quite short hair ... __eou__ What , curly ? __eou__ No , not at all . Very straight . Her hair comes down like this ... just over the ears . __eou__ Does she wear glasses ? __eou__ No ... no . I think you're thinking of someone else . __eou__ No . I'm sure I know her . __eou__ Er ... what else can I tell you ? Er ... she's got ... er a ... round face , a very round face , and a very big mouth , sort of wide mouth , when she laughs , her face is all mouth . __eou__ Ah ... No , I can't place her . __eou__
I cannot ignore her suggestion . In fact I always value her suggestion . __eou__ I know . Maybe you will get the air if you go against her . __eou__ Well , it takes two to to make a happy marriage . __eou__ And it takes two to make an agreement too . You have no guts , I am afraid . __eou__
She has contributed to a new school . __eou__ Oh , I know . She is a famous woman and a focus of the newspaper now because of this thing . __eou__ I hear the school is very modern . It has the best equipments . __eou__ Yes . Do you know its name . __eou__ She said she would name it after her father . __eou__ Oh , I think she wants to do this thing in memory of her father . __eou__
We can go to the cinema or say at home watching TV , what's it to be ? __eou__ As far as I'm concerned , staying at home is more comfortable than going to the movies . __eou__ Thanks , dear . I feel so tired after a whole day's work . __eou__
I heard that James was fired because he got a keep back of 20 thousands dollars from a vender . __eou__ That ’ s open secret . __eou__ But mine could be a lie for his job . __eou__ How did you know that ? __eou__ A little bird whispered to me . Keep that to yourself . __eou__
Mom ? __eou__ Mm ? __eou__ Can my friend , Tom Mitchum , come home with me for lunch tomorrow ? __eou__ Of course , Jim . Have I met Tom before ? __eou__ Mm — hmm . You met him last summer . He is small and very smart . __eou__ Oh , yes . I remember Tom . His family comes from Maine , right ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__
Recycling is big business these days , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it's definitely a growing business . __eou__ What do you recycle in your plant ? __eou__ Mainly plastics . Plastics aren ’ t bio degradable - they don ’ t break down easily in the environment - so they shouldn't be thrown away . __eou__ How is plastic recycled , then ? __eou__ Well , there are basically two methods . One is to break down the chemicals in the plastic into smaller chemical particles . These can then be used in the production of new chemicals . __eou__ Is that the method you use here ? __eou__ No , we don't do that here . We recycle polyethylene and we make it into other products . __eou__ How do you do that ? __eou__ By melting it down and then reforming it . Our main products are bin liners for kitchen bins and carrier bags for supermarkets . __eou__
I am looking for a comfortable convenient way to see the country . __eou__ Have you heard of motor coaching ? It's one of the fastest-growing segments for the travel industry . __eou__ No , I've not heard of it . Tell me about it . __eou__ It's almost like going on an ocean cruise except that you go by land . Everything is planned for you from the moment you step on board a luxury coach . __eou__ Is it just a bus ? __eou__ Oh . no . The motor coach is air-conditioned , there is a galley for food preparation , movies or music are available for your entertainment and attendants are there to take care of your every need . __eou__ Wow ! That sounds like pure luxury . __eou__
What price do you suggest for 300,000 sets of Article No . 2323 with London as the destination port ? __eou__ Let me see . It's £ 800 per set CIF London . __eou__ What commission terms can you offer ? __eou__ Usually the commission is three percent of the net invoice amount after deduction of discounts . __eou__ Couldn't you raise the commission to five percent ? __eou__ Considering our good relationship and our future business , we give you four percent . That's the best we can do . We can't go any further . What would you say to it ? __eou__ Then I'll accept it with thanks . __eou__
How are you doing ? Pretty good , I imagine ? __eou__ Actually not so good . That's why we made a special trip to see you . __eou__ OK , let me hear it . I'd be glad to help if I can . __eou__ Good . I want to discuss with you the mode of payment for the construction of the power plant under negotiation . __eou__ Well , I trust that your presence will hasten the settlement of payment terms . __eou__ I would like to explain to you our financial position . The manufacture of machinery and its accessories and parts will consume both time and money . It takes five years to manufacture the machinery and we will have to advance the cost for the main machines to be produced , and besides this there are large sums to be paid to our subcontractors for the manufacture of the accessories and parts . __eou__ But for an enterprise of your size , an order from us will certainly not embarrass you financially . __eou__ Well , in fact , it is beyond our financial capability . __eou__ In what way can we solve the problem ? __eou__ Have you considered the possibility of a buyer's credit ? __eou__ Yes . But the sum is large , it must be provided by a group of banks . __eou__ So , we propose your company apply to Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation for a long-term loan . Six months before each shipment , you through Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation open , in our favour , an irrevocable , dividable L / C which is to remain valid for two months . __eou__ Well , we accept your suggestion . __eou__
I am afraid the label is not quite suitable for this locality . Could you quote us for the order with neutral cases ? __eou__ I am afraid not . We usually design the label ourselves . You know we should be responsible for the brand labels of our goods . __eou__ In that case , we'd like you to make some changes in the labeling . __eou__ What are they ? __eou__ First , the languages on the label should be in both English and French . Second , the red color doesn't suit our national customs . Could you print the label in some light colors such as yellowish or bluish ? __eou__ That can be easily done . Is there anything else ? __eou__ The brand name and the nice artwork need not be changed , but the net weight must be placed on the lower part of the panel . __eou__ We'll get the factory to meet your requirements . __eou__ Thanks for your help . __eou__
Ahahah ! What is that thing on your couch ! It just moved ! __eou__ Did you think it wasn't real ? That's my pet lizard . __eou__ You have a pet lizard ? Somehow I never would have imagined that . __eou__ His name is Grunt . Come closer and I'll properly introduce you . __eou__ Does it bite or scratch ? __eou__ No , he's perfectly harmless . And he's not afraid of strangers either . Here , hold him . __eou__ Wow . He's heavy ! And his skin feels really cool . __eou__ Stick around and you'll get to know him better . He has a very unusual personality . __eou__
Did you already take the history exam ? __eou__ Yeah . It was hard . When do you take it ? __eou__ I take it tomorrow morning . There is so much material that I dont know what to emphasize on . What types of questions did you get ? __eou__ Mostly on the civil war . You should also study the impact Martin Luther King Jr . had on American society . __eou__ What about Abraham Lincoln ? Did you get any questions about him ? __eou__ I only had 1 question about him . But you might get more . I dont know if he will have the same exam or not . __eou__ Hopefully he will use the same exam , cause Im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war . It is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class . __eou__ If you cant study everything , then that is probably the best way to go . __eou__ Aright . Thanks for the info . I gotta go to the library now . __eou__ Good luck . __eou__ Thanks . See ya . __eou__
Excuse me , i am a new student here . Could you tell me where the English Department is ? __eou__ It is in that brand new , tall building over there . On the 9th floor . __eou__ Where is the school cafeteria ? __eou__ It is the basement of that red building in front of the tower with big bells . __eou__ Where is the Computer Center ? __eou__ The Computer Center is on the first floor of the library . __eou__ Where is the library ? __eou__ The library is next to the Adminstration Building . The Adminstration Building is over there near the school ’ s main entrance . There are school maps for free in the lobby of the Admin . __eou__ Thank you . I will go get one . __eou__ Sure . Glad to be of service . By the way , my name is Mike Sullivan . You will see me around a lot . I am running for President of the Student Government . __eou__ Well , hi ! My name is Eve Markowski . I am glad to meet you . With your friendly smile and helpful attitude . I am sure you will win . __eou__ Thanks you for the encouragement . __eou__ You are welcome . I ’ d better go . Goodbye . __eou__ Have a good day . Bye-Bye ! __eou__
Do you think you could keep the noise down ? __eou__ I'm sorry . Am I keeping you awake ? __eou__ Yes . And another thing , would you mind not making long distance calls ? __eou__ I'm sorry . I thought you wouldn't mind . __eou__
Hello , Jane ! __eou__ Hi , Tom . How have you been ? __eou__ Pretty good . Actually , I'm quite busy with work . By the way , say ' hello ' to your husband . __eou__
He is so kind . I couldn ’ t believe he murdered his wife . __eou__ Of course not . I believe he ’ s innocent . __eou__ I don ’ t understand . __eou__ He nursed a viper in his bosom . His best friend Tony foamed him in . Tony first seduced his wife and then trapped him . __eou__
Are you telling us a lie again ? __eou__ I will be hanged if I lying . __eou__ All right . But what was the trouble ? __eou__ My car run out of petrol . __eou__
Lucy , what are your priorities when buying a car ? __eou__ I guess the first thing is the price , the second is the size , and of course the color will play a role too . But I have to be honest . It is our today ’ s responsibility to take care about our environment . Therefore , I will also pay attention to the fuel consumption of the car . You know , the rise in gasoline prices is huge . So I would rather to consider a smaller car with smaller engine . For which I can also save some tax . Last of the list , I also consider the safety . __eou__ What about the environmental factors ? __eou__ Well , I do prefer the lower emission cars as long as it doesn ’ t cost much . Some environmentally-friendly cars are really expensive . __eou__ Sure they are . Some hi-tech devices are built in to make sure they pollute less . Some of these green cars have not become standard . So the production costs are still high . But anyway , we should make efforts to start with . __eou__
You know what , last night I almost got hit by a vase falling from the third floor . __eou__ Oh , how dreadful ! I ’ m ever so sorry . __eou__ Luckily that was nothing serious . __eou__ Thank God ! __eou__
What do you consider to be your strong points ? __eou__ I think I ’ m tough not only physically but mentally . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ I have been playing football since high school . At present , I ’ m a member of a community football club . __eou__ Really ? Are you still playing ? __eou__ Yes . I practice every weekend with my teammates . __eou__ I see . You must be tough . __eou__ I never get tired . I think this comes from practicing football . __eou__ What do you consider to be your weak points ? __eou__ Frankly speaking , I ’ m a typical Chinese workaholic . I don ’ t mind working late at night . Due to that , I tend to leave the office late . __eou__ What kind of people are you reluctant to work with ? __eou__ So far I haven ’ t met any particular kind . However , I may rule out those who prefer chatting to working . __eou__ Do you prefer to work alone or as part of a team ? __eou__ It depends on the type of work . Usually I prefer to work alone , because I ’ m self-motivated . But I can work either way . If necessary , I don ’ t hesitate to join the team . __eou__
How much do you have budgeted for our trip to Las Angeles ? __eou__ In total , it should be about $ 5,000 for the week conference . Would you like to see the breakdown ? __eou__ Yes , I want to know exactly where the money is going . Give me a detailed report . __eou__ First we have the airline tickets , which are $ 500 per person ; with four of us going , that's t $ 2,000 . For our accommodations , we're spending $ 80 a night , per room , for five days . That's another $ 800 . __eou__ Weren ’ t you able to find anything less expensive ? We're sharing rooms , right ? __eou__ I have two people to a room . The $ 80 room rate is the lowest I could find . With the conference going on that week , all the hotels have inflated their prices , they're making a killing . __eou__ So far we have $ 2,800 , what else ? __eou__ I have budget $ 25 per Peron per day for food expenses . That totals another $ 800 . And for other incidentals , like take fees , and tips , I have estimated about $ 400 . __eou__ Well , that's only $ 4000 . Didn't you tell me your budget was $ 5000 ? Where is the rest of the money ? __eou__ That's my buffer ... I wanted to leave a little room in the budget , just in case---it's better to be safe than sorry . __eou__
Lisa , are there family rules in this house ? __eou__ Well , I wouldn't call them rules , but there are some things that I expect my daughter to do . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ Setting the table and doing the dishes . __eou__ Is there anything else ? __eou__ I also expect Cindy to tidy up her own room . __eou__ Her room is very neat and clean . __eou__ Yeah . She's a very responsible person . __eou__ I will keep my room clean , too . That's a promise . __eou__
Professor , where's Canada ? __eou__ Canada is north of here . __eou__ Can you show me on the map ? __eou__ Sure . Look here . Canada is north of the United States . __eou__ Oh , I see . Where's Mexico ? __eou__ Mexico is south of the United States . __eou__ How about Connecticut ? Where's that ? __eou__ Connecticut is east of New York . __eou__ What state is west of Pennsylvania ? __eou__ Ohio . __eou__ OK , Where's Los Angeles ? __eou__ Los Angeles is in California . It's southeast of San Francisco . __eou__ Where's Boston . __eou__ Boston is in the northeast part of the country . __eou__ Where is Las Vegas ? __eou__ Las Vegas is in the southwest . __eou__
Do you have any particular hobbies , Tom ? __eou__ Oh , yes . I love playing badminton , table tennis and computer games . And playing the games has become my favorite . __eou__ I hear many teenagers will spend hours and hours sitting at computers . And they don't care about their own health at all . How about you ? __eou__ I'm no better than them . They say it's mindless to sit in front of a machine all the time , but I think it's stimulating . __eou__ You won't play online games full of violence , will you ? __eou__ Once in a while . __eou__ It's no good . And I think spending several hours each day playing computer games is a waste of time . You might as well do something healthy and meaningful . __eou__ I hope I can practice self-control again . __eou__
Come on , you must tell me everything about him . __eou__ Well , he's very tall and handsome . __eou__ Hmm ... __eou__ He has big blue eyes and long blonde hair . __eou__ Oh , how long ? __eou__ Down to his shoulders . It's beautiful , like gold . __eou__ OK . OK . You'd better tell me what he does . __eou__ He's a very creative painter . His paintings sell well . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ He's quite a patient teacher , too . __eou__ Fine . __eou__ You're going to like him . Everybody says he's a nice guy . __eou__
How about your study at college ? __eou__ I was doing quite well at college . I completed my MBA degree in international trade with first-class honors . __eou__ Why did you select your college ? __eou__ I selected my college because it had an excellent academic reputation . __eou__ What do you like doing in your spare time ? __eou__ My favorite recreation is cooking . I learned to cook Chinese dishes and western style dishes as well . It keeps me busy and makes me happy . __eou__
Next , please . Where to , sir ? __eou__ A one-way ticket to Chicago , please . __eou__ How many did you say , sir ? __eou__ One adult , please . __eou__ That will be six dollars . Out of ten-seven , eight , nine , ten . Thank you . __eou__
Can I have the roll of film developed here ? __eou__ Surely of course . __eou__ Here is the film . Can I get my pictures tomorrow ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Besides I want two copies of all the photos . __eou__
Should we tip ? This service is pretty good . __eou__ Yeah , we probably should.How much is normal ? __eou__ How about 10 percent ? That's about 6 dollars . __eou__ That sounds about right . __eou__
I ’ Ve always wondered , what ’ s the difference between English for Chinese students and English for native students ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . What do you think ? __eou__ I think a Chinese student concentrates on written English , and uses it as a basis for communicating . From start to finish he ’ s learning vocabulary and fundamentals of grammar . This is a very difficult way to learn . __eou__ What do natives get ? __eou__ They get higher level English , which is more formal than everyday spoken English . They also deal with matters of style and creativity . __eou__ Do you mean that a native doesn ’ t make any mistakes in grammar ? __eou__ Absolutely not ! Native speakers make a lot of grammar mistakes , especially if they come from a home where nonstandard English is spoken . __eou__ I suppose that only a small percentage of college students don ’ t know standard English in American universities . __eou__ Actually there are more non-native speakers than you think . That ’ s why it ’ s so important to quit worrying about making mistakes . Just talk to everyone every chance you get . __eou__
David , do you think which team will get the champion tonight ? __eou__ It is hard to guess now . Both of the teams chose the excellent players this time . I guess the game will end in a tie . They are equally matched . __eou__ I am so nervous now . What a terrific game ! __eou__ Which side are you on ? __eou__ It's hard to say , because each team has my idols . __eou__ Wow ! AC wins . It is a close shave , you know . __eou__ I will never forget this match . The angle is so terrible and so correct . __eou__ What a good goal ! __eou__
Are you saying you saw an eagle ? There are no eagles here . __eou__ Yes , I saw one . Believe me . __eou__ You must have seen some other kind of bird . __eou__

Jim is a genius . He gets along well with everybody and he can always get the work done . __eou__ A boss likes him a lot . He says Jim is a good team player . __eou__ Everybody would like to have Jim on their team . Because he is funny and helpful and he can contribute a lot to the team he belongs to . __eou__ Maybe we all should learn something from him . __eou__ Right . __eou__
Julia , I saw two men fighting beside our door this morning . __eou__ I know them . They are the two brothers living next door . __eou__ Brothers ? Do you know why they quarreled ? __eou__ It's said that the father's will caused the dissension among the two brothers . __eou__ Is there anybody acting as mediator in the dispute ? __eou__ No , everyone keeps in mind that ' Don't intrude in a family dispute ' . __eou__
One family skeleton of my family was that my younger brother has an axe to grind . __eou__ What did he aim at ? __eou__ He began to be interested in finance because he thought he would be able to inherit the family ’ s fortune . __eou__ How could he have such an ill intention ? I think your father can see that through . __eou__
Did you bring some lunch with you ? __eou__ Yes , I packed it myself . __eou__ Wow , that looks beautiful . __eou__ It's my health-conscious lunch , good for my health and beauty . __eou__ I might try it myself . __eou__
Taylor , you're sweating up a storm ! __eou__ Your boyfriend , Bryan , wanted to toss the football . I think he wore me out . __eou__ Yeah , you look a little shaky . And pale . You seriously need some time in the sun . __eou__ You're like the tenth person to say that . __eou__ We're just worried about you , Taylor . __eou__ Whatever . I wish people would just leave me alone ! __eou__
I love ice cream . __eou__ Really ? Me , too . What's your favorite flavor ? __eou__ I like both strawberry and coffee ice cream . __eou__ Chocolate is mine . __eou__
This man is your fiance , Dolly ? __eou__ Yeah , how do you like him ? __eou__ He's handsome . __eou__ Can you give me a touch of his character ? __eou__ He's outgoing and honest , but sometimes he's a bit conservative . __eou__
I'm the coolest high-tech stud around ... __eou__ Why ? Do you have a robot girlfriend ? __eou__ Not yet ... I got an MP3 player and a set of stereo headphones . __eou__ So you can download MP3 music from the Net and record it onto the MP3 chip ? __eou__ Yep ! And take it with me anywhere ! And the music is free ! __eou__ Let me see it ! It's so small ! __eou__
You have always got your nose in the air , which hurts many boys ’ hearts . __eou__ I am afraid not . I have no interest in them at all . __eou__
have you read the feature article about Oprah Winfrey in this magazine ? __eou__ no , what's it about ? __eou__ apparently , she's being given an award for donating so much money to charity . __eou__ she's very generous with her money . I think that's because she was poor when she was young . __eou__ I heard that she's one of the wealthiest women in the world . __eou__ I'd believe it . She owns magazines , television shows and she has a huge fan base . __eou__ you know ; I heard that she was opening a school for underprivileged girls in Africa . __eou__ did they mention that in the article ? __eou__ yes , she's not only building the school , but is also using her own money for the upkeep of the school and to pay the teachers a fair salary . __eou__ that's really commendable . I think more celebrities should use their money to help people like Oprah has . __eou__ I agree . So many celebrities waste their money on sports cars , expensive clothing , and luxurious hotels . __eou__ it's amazing how much money they can spend . I heard Britney Spears once spent $ 24,000 a night on a hotel room ! __eou__ what a waste . It's good to see some stars that are more concerned with charity than status symbols . __eou__

Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ? __eou__ I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ’ s better to get to know it . What about you ? __eou__ I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays . __eou__ Oh , my God ! John , I didn ’ t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory . __eou__ Come on , Han Maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion . __eou__ But I ’ m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ? __eou__ Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world . __eou__ I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ’ t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ? __eou__ That ’ s a little complicated . You ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ’ s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England . __eou__ Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ? __eou__ Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans . __eou__ How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ? __eou__ That ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries . __eou__ So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ? __eou__ Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College . __eou__ Why did they want to found a college ? __eou__ Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__ Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name . __eou__ When did it begin to be called Harvard University ? __eou__ In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman . __eou__ It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion . __eou__ Therefore , it ’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard . __eou__ Wow , I didn ’ t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history . __eou__ Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S . __eou__ I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard . __eou__ Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related . __eou__ That ’ s right . I have a lot to learn from you . __eou__ You can ask me any question at any time . __eou__
Can I borrow these magazines ? __eou__ Fill in the slip , then take it to the circulation desk . They will get you what you want . __eou__ Are we allowed to go into the stacks to look for books ? __eou__ Sorry , the stacks are closed to undergraduate students . __eou__
Rachel has decided to quit smoking . __eou__ Really ? Why ? __eou__ You never guess she is going to have a baby . __eou__ Oh , it's unbelievable . She is such a chain smoker . __eou__ Yes , yes .

When I was at school , I was quite good at track and field events . I was on the school team for the long jump , 100 and 200 meter sprints and the javelin . __eou__ Really ? I was quite good at the hurdles and the discus . __eou__ I wish that I were good at the discus , but I could rarely throw it in the right direction ! I was awful . With the hurdles , I could never jump over them ! __eou__ I thought you were good at the high jump ! __eou__ No , I was good at the long jump . I liked the sprints best . __eou__ Did you ever win any competitions ? __eou__ I was regional champion for the 100 and 200 meters . I usually did well in the dong jump competitions , but I couldn ’ t compete with kids from other schools in the javelin . How about you ? __eou__ I came second and third a few times in the regional championships , but I never won . Did you ever take part in the national championship for the sprinting events ? __eou__ Yes , I did , but I didn ’ t do very well . I made the final in both events , but came last . At least I made the final . I was very pleased with that . __eou__
Do you have a copy of today ’ s newspaper ? I want to check the results from the world athletics championship . __eou__ Yes , I ‘ m just reading them myself . It ’ s been a great competition . We got gold medals in three events . __eou__ Yes , we won the men ’ s 110 metres hurdles . I watched that on TV . What other events did we win ? __eou__ We won the men ’ s high jump and the women ’ s 1500 meters . __eou__ That ’ s great . Those athletes must train for years to get into peak physical condition . They must be terribly disappointed if they don ’ t win . __eou__ The woman who won the 1500 meters also broke the world record by 2 seconds . __eou__ That ’ s amazing ! Were any other records broken ? __eou__ A Russian man broke the discus record by a centimeters . Out best athlete broke his personal best in the long jump , but it only got him third place . __eou__ Did you see the final of the men ’ s 100 metres ? It was very exciting . One competitor made two false starts . __eou__ Was he disqualified ? __eou__ Yes , he was . I imagine he must be very angry with himself for that . __eou__
Michael Johnson doesn ’ t look graceful , but he sure is powerful . __eou__ If I were on as many steroids as he was , I think I ’ d be powerful , too . __eou__ What are you talking about ? ! He ’ s passed every drug test he ’ s taken ! __eou__ Those drug tests don ’ t mean anything ! He probably took some other drugs to mask the steroids . __eou__ Just because Ben Johnson was juiced up doesn ’ t mean all athletes are . __eou__ OK , OK . I ’ m feeling a little dehydrated . Let ’ s get something to drink . __eou__
Has Alan shown up yet ? __eou__ Nope . I guess something might have come up . __eou__ I wonder what happened . __eou__ I don't know .

What happened ? __eou__ His sister had a car accident last week . __eou__ Is she fine now ? __eou__ She is still in a coma . __eou__ Oh , poor Alan ! His sister is the only one he has left since his parents died last year . __eou__
Doctor , save my baby , please __eou__ What symptoms does he have ? __eou__ He has had a fever for one day . Just now at home , he had febrile convulsions with teeth and fists clenched and eyes turned up . We were at a loss what to do . We called an ambulance and brought the baby here . __eou__ How long did the convulsion last ? __eou__ About 3 minutes . __eou__ Does he have any other complaints ? __eou__ Three days ago , he began to cough , sneeze and have a running nose . Yesterday , he began to have a fever . __eou__ Have you taken his temperature ? __eou__ It was 38 ° C this morning and it was 39 ° C just now . __eou__ Let me examine him to see if there is any rash . No rash . __eou__ Is it serious ? Is it meningitis ? __eou__ No , it is not meningitis . Just a high fever and convulsions , which results from a virus upper respiratory tract inflection . __eou__ Does he have to be admitted to hospital ? __eou__ No . No need for admission . I'll give the baby analgia nose drops to bring down the temperature first . Then I will give you a prescription . The pink tablets are used for his fever . When his temperature is over 38 ° C , give him one tablet . The other tablets are sedatives for his convulsions . The white liquid is for the cold . Give the baby plenty of water to drink . __eou__ Thank you very much , doctor . __eou__
In foreign trade , language differences are very important . __eou__ Yes . If people can not communicate with each other easily , they can not understand each other's way of thinking . __eou__ Fortunately , there is a widely-spoken commercial language , namely English . __eou__ Many exporters speak French and German as well . __eou__ In South America , the most common language is Spanish and Portuguese . __eou__ Even if the language is accurate , a misunderstanding can not be avoided due to cultural differences . __eou__ Yes , the language is a part of culture . It reflects a nation's character . __eou__ Yes , it not only includes the nation's historical and cultural background , but also contains the nation's view of life way of life and way of thinking . __eou__ So in foreign trade , you must be very clear about language differences . __eou__

Susan , can you tell me in a nutshell what the retail market is like in China ? __eou__ Well , as per capital income goes up and up , the growth sector seems to be in the high-end . __eou__ Retail is going upscale here ? China is certainly growing more quickly than I had imagined . __eou__ Yes . Things certainly have changed since I was a boy . We've developed very quickly . __eou__ Do you think the trend will continue ? __eou__ I don't see why not . We do have some problems , but we are still willing to work hard and wages aren't too high at this point . __eou__ Everything I've seen so far is very impressive , very impressive indeed . __eou__
We're on the same team here , Elvin . I'm being nice because we need to get along together . __eou__ I know you , Zina . You're only nice when you want something . __eou__ If we want to beat WebTracker , we're going to have to work hand in hand . __eou__ To be honest , I'm starting to wonder if it's worth it . __eou__ You'd rather lose to WebTracker than do things my way ? __eou__ You said it , not me . __eou__
Then , Mary . We need 10 more loose-leaf binders , five pounds of heavy duty white paper , and what else did I say ? __eou__ Two boxes of transparencies for the over-head machines . __eou__ Right .

He ’ ll stop . __eou__ Looks like the one guy lost control in all this rain , and the other one hit him . __eou__ Yeah . It ’ s pretty bad , that car looks like a coke can . __eou__ These accidents always cause traffic jams on rainy days . __eou__ Yeah , it looks like we ’ re in for a long drive . __eou__ Ah , well . Put on the news . I got up late and missed it . __eou__ All right . __eou__

I'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career ! __eou__ So he talks about you behind your back ? __eou__ Yes . He's all nice and friendly to my face . But the second I turn around he stabs me in the back ! __eou__ I had a worker like that once . She was always taking credit for my ideas . __eou__ I should keep a better record of my correspondence with the clients so if necessary I can prove it was my effort . __eou__ My co-worker had a whole bunch of bad office habits . She liked to name-drop ... we would be in a meeting and she would say , yesterday I was chatting with Tom . She meant Tom Solomon ... our CEO . __eou__
Table-tennis is our national game . __eou__ Yes , I like ping-pong very much , but I can't play well . __eou__ I can't , either . I like watching . __eou__

We've got very good workshop facilities here . We do all our own servicing and most repairs .

If we don't have the facilities to deal with it here , we send it out for maintenance . __eou__ Is that more expensive ? __eou__ It depends on the job . It's actually more cost-effective than buying specialist equipment that we don't use very often . __eou__
Mary , come here . I've found the book our teacher recommended us to buy last week . __eou__ Really ? How much is it ? Oh , it's 42 yuan ! How expensive ! __eou__ You know , it is the best seller for this year . It has had its fifth impression since its publication early this year . __eou__ How come ? I have never seen such a popular book before . __eou__ Wait a minute . I found there were two printings . The paperback books must be much cheaper . __eou__ You are right . Let's buy the cheaper one . __eou__

Wow , the view from the peak is so grand ! __eou__ Look , most of the maple leaves have turned red . __eou__ Did you ever see this kind of beautiful scene ? __eou__ Of course , my father used to take me to Kiang Shan or somewhere like that as a child . __eou__ But my father did not .

Hello , Lucy , I heard you did a good deal in interview . __eou__ It's OK . __eou__ What did you do in the interview ? __eou__ I observed the interviewer's manner , mien and gesture carefully besides paying attention to mine . __eou__ Are all these helpful for the interview ? __eou__ Of course . The manner of shaking hands can show a man ’ s character . For example , the interviewer who shakes your hand lightly , is a easygoing man although he looks cool . __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ You can discover interviewer's eyes because they can show his thoughts , and can judge whether he is interested in your words by his gesture and mien . __eou__
Lindsay Tipping gave me your name as a reference . We are considering hiring her as an editor for our magazine . __eou__ Lindsay , of course , I will be more than happy to recommend her to you . __eou__ How long was she employed with your company ? __eou__ She freelanced with us for 3 years .

How do you think she will manage in an office environment ? __eou__ She ’ s a consummate professional and a team-player . I have utmost confidence in her abilities . You can ’ t go wrong in hiring her . __eou__
Do you think discrimination against women in the work force is still prevalent even today ? __eou__ From my own experience as a career woman , I would have to say that while things are getting better now than they used to be , it is still a widespread problem . Society is changing , but there is still a glass ceiling for women in many career tracks . __eou__ do you think the glass ceiling phenomena is because of traditional social customs ? Or are there more issues coming into play ? __eou__ I think it's a very complicated issue . A part of the difficulties women have advancing in the work force are due to few opportunities and many male managers . Don't underestimate the good ole ' boy system . Men have power , so it's easier for them to stay in power . __eou__ What about affirmative action ? Hasn't legislation changed a lot of the make hierarchy ? __eou__ Affirmative action has given us management quotas and bans sexual discrimination , but it's still a man's world . __eou__
What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ Your secretary seems to think she is being harassed . __eou__ What ? You've got to be kidding me ! __eou__ I wish I were , but i am deadly serious . She said you invited her to dinner last week . __eou__ Of course I did . As recognition for a job well done . Once a month I invite the most productive employee to dinner . __eou__ Well , there is no problem there . But she seemed to think that you were angry when she refused , and that your motives are personal and not professional . __eou__ I think she's misinterpreted my intentions . What happens now ? __eou__ Our harassment policy requires that we have a meeting with the HR manager and Miss Brown . It's quite serious . You could be reprimanded , or even fired if we find evidence that you were pressuring __eou__ I understand that . But I hope that we can get to the bottom fo this and show Miss Brown that she misunderstood my reaction . __eou__ That's the purpose of the meeting . Sometimes a mediated conversation will straighten things out , and a little discussion and apology can calm the waters . __eou__

The most important factor is I like tinkering with machines . __eou__ What are you primarily interested in about mechanical engineering ? __eou__ I like designing products , and one of my designs received an award . Moreover , I am familiar with CAD . But I can do any mechanic well if I am employed . __eou__ Why did you decide to apply for this position ? __eou__ Your company has a very good reputation , and I am very interested in the field your company is in . __eou__ What do you think determines an employee's progress in a company such as ours ? __eou__ Interpersonal and technical skills . __eou__ We have several applicants for this position . Why do you think you are the person we should choose ? __eou__ I have the abilities , qualities and experience that you requested in your job advert , for example I have three years experience in designing products and I got leadership experience while serving the college student union as president . __eou__ That sounds very good . How do you see your career development ? __eou__ After a few years of gaining experience in the company and furthering my professional qualifications I'd like to put my experience and skills to use in management . I want to become a supervisor in your R & D department . __eou__ Have you anything to ask about the job ? __eou__ Yes . Do you offer any opportunities for further study ? __eou__ Yes . If you undertake additional courses , provided these are approved , and you complete them successfully , you can claim back part , quite a large part , 75 % of the costs you incurred . Not just the fees , - traveling and other expenses too . __eou__ That's fine . __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ No . __eou__ Well , thank you very much , Mr . Sun . I'll let you know the result of the interview as soon as possible . Goodbye . __eou__ Thank you , Mrs . Smith . I do hope the answer will be favorable . Goodbye . __eou__

Jenny , what's your favorite color ? __eou__ I like red . __eou__ Now , we're going to draw an apple in your sketch book . What do we use ? __eou__ Dad , I want to draw with crayons , can I ? __eou__ Why not ? Let's draw the outline of an apple with your pencil first . __eou__
Playing the chess is very exhausting , isn't ? __eou__ No , doing it in the long run will make you an acute man . __eou__ I'm afraid playing the chess like that will soon make me an old man . I noticed that most chess players were bald . __eou__ That's because you are always fixing your eyes on the bald . __eou__
Then I'll have to borrow it . __eou__ Sure you can . But I'm only gonna keep it for a month . __eou__ Why ? It's in mint condition ! __eou__ That's why I can profit from it ! __eou__ You're going to re-sell it on eBay Taiwan ? __eou__ You bet . eBay Taiwan doesn't have it ! And bidding will start at two thousand NT . This baby's worth about six thousand to real tennis fans ... __eou__ I've created a monster ... you're a better bayer than me ! __eou__
Hey ! A real cook gets down and dirty . Besides , I think I look good covered in baking mix ... __eou__ What concoction are you making ? __eou__ Well , your making cinnamon toast inspired me to go out and buy a waffle maker . __eou__ Awesome ! I'm in heaven . Let me help . They're so easy . __eou__ I know . You just add milk , eggs and a little oil to the baking mix and stir ... __eou__ And then you just pour the batter into the waffle iron ... __eou__
Let's have seafood for a change.How about oyster and lobster ? __eou__ I couldn't agree more ! __eou__ Anything else you want to add ? __eou__ Oh , yeah , two beers . __eou__

We are a tough team as well . __eou__

But if you both determine to divorce , I hope you will have an amicable split . __eou__ Thank you , Steven . I accept your advice . __eou__
I hear that you've been to the Saikei Ski Resort for the weekend .

The top-level coaches there are from the State Sports General Administration . __eou__ Could you move smoothly ? __eou__ Yes.My face even ached in the icy wind . __eou__ What happened afterwards ? __eou__ I was skiing on and on excitedly until I realized one thing-I could not stop ! You can just imagine how terrified I was . __eou__ Poor girl ! __eou__
Is the clock right ? __eou__ I'm afraid it gains a little . __eou__ By how many minutes ? __eou__ Two . __eou__
Judy , have you ever made out how much money shall we spend ? __eou__ Oh , yeah . The total amount is no less than 13,000 RIB , according to our itinerary . __eou__ What ?

First of all , it is nearly 4,000 RIB that we should spend in transportation . __eou__ Ah , the transportation fee always takes a great part in the budget . __eou__ Then we must pay a large amount of money for the hotel . But if we want to save money , we can choose a hotel which is not so good . __eou__ Hmm , what I'm fearful of is that the accommodation will also deteriorate once we choose a cheaper hotel . __eou__ In that case , we can choose the Youth Hotel . It's a good choice , clean and economic . __eou__
What did you say ? __eou__ I said he was nothing but a yeoman . __eou__ Then he become angry with you ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__

I want to install a security door . __eou__ Is the security door useful ? __eou__ Yes , I think so . The security door is so firm that nobody can break in . __eou__ I totally agree with you . In this way I won't be afraid of the burglar if you are away . __eou__ OK , I will do it right now . __eou__
You look like being on cloud nine . __eou__ I am . __eou__ What has made you so happy ? __eou__ I think I'm in love . __eou__ Are you ? Who's the lucky girl ? __eou__ Her name is Jenny . __eou__ How did you meet her ? __eou__ We are in the same math class . Our teacher sat us next to each other . __eou__ What do you like best about her ? __eou__ She's very funny . She makes me laugh all the time . __eou__ I guess it was fate working to bring you together . __eou__ Whatever brought us together , I'm happy . __eou__
Well , Mike , nowadays there's much talk about nanometer . But what on earth is it ? __eou__ Nanometer is a length scale . It's one billionth of a meter , roughly ten times the size of an individual atom . __eou__ Hmm ... it's hard to figure out the exact size , I'm afraid . __eou__ Well , let's make it this way . For comparison , 10 NM is 1000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair . There are as many nanometers in an inch as there are inches in 400 miles . __eou__ I see.Thank you . __eou__
Where's Bill ? The ambassador is already here . The meeting is set to start at 9 am . __eou__ He's late again . Traffic is probably holding him up . You know , he commutes from the suburbs . It's not easy commuting every day . We should cut him some slack . __eou__ Even though the traffic is bumper-to-bumper out there , I don't think it's heavy traffic that makes Bill late . He takes the train , remember ? __eou__ Oh , that's right . Well , the train shouldn't be late . That means there is only one explanation ... Bill must have overslept . __eou__ Well , to be fare , since he's coming all the way from Lancaster , he's got to get up much earlier than the rest of us . He must get start on his commute about six thirty , no telling what time he actually gets up . __eou__ That's right , because he's got to get to the train station from his house , then take the blue line into the city , then switch trains to the red line . In all , the trip's got to take more than 2 hours . __eou__ Why doesn't he just drive to work ? __eou__ It's too difficult to park your car in the city . Also , the traffic coming in from the suburbs is a nightmare . __eou__
Where did you get assigned to go this time around ? __eou__ They asked me to go to Paris to check on the new office that was just established there . And you ? __eou__ Hong Kong again .

Are there any special requirements on the project ? And shall we talk around it in details ? __eou__ Yes , there're some samples in our office and you can take some to study it . Besides , you see , in recent years , we've visited a diversity of factory buildings all over the world and we hope that our building is the perfect match of advanced technology and attractiveness . __eou__ That's a good idea . We can improve our technology to meet your special need . __eou__ And please let white color dominate . __eou__ OK ! I've noted it down . And any others ? __eou__ Oh ! I've almost forgot the location was transferred to the A county in the east of the city . __eou__ I'll tell them . __eou__ Well , the most important thing is that our company demand the quality be exactly the same as the sample which you'll take from the office on the third floor . __eou__ Please feel assured that we'll abide by our promise . And we'll do everything we can to ensure delivery . __eou__ Thanks a lot . And I believe I'll have a good time working with you . __eou__ I think so . Bye ! __eou__ Bye ! __eou__

Have a seat please . __eou__ I would like to know the state of the residential property market right now because I have an apartment to sell . __eou__ Sure , here is my business card . I'm James Wilson . Let me explain to you how things are . In recent months , the demand for residential properties has become extremely high .
