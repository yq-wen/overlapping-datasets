Bon voyage ! __eou__ Goodbye . __eou__
Today , we have invited a special guest , Prof . Yang . He will give us some advice on the legal aspects of international business . Your international legal advice is important to our business well being . Please give us some counsels on such issues as which laws govern the contract , what recourse is available for default or breach of contract by our clients or what to do if a dispute arises . __eou__ The significance of understanding the nuance and distinctions of foreign customs and business practices are a continual challenge for global entrepreneurs and trader . Despite many countries accession to TO membership , trade and investment frictions are still predominant among existing membership . However , these frictions will be better managed under the TO trade rules and the organization's dispute settlement mechanism . __eou__ In spite of this , international business contracts and arrangement must be precise , specific and all-inclusive to lessen misunderstanding , misconceptions and disagreements to the minimum 。 __eou__ Problem and disputes occur mainly due to difference in the laws of countries involved . For this very reason , it is imperative to establish from the outset which law governs when disputes arise . The most fundamental principle of all international contracts is the applicable laws and regulations . Make sure that the arbitration clause in your business contract be all-inclusive . __eou__ How can we protect our patents and trade market abroad ? __eou__ Yes , it will be your utmost interest to protect your intellectual property such as your innovations , idea , designs and copyrights in your target country . __eou__ As you know , our main focus is to penetrate the markets of countries in Asia . What is the current legal framework in the countries ? __eou__ The lack of regulatory transparency was a problem and still is to some extent . However , the countries are moving forward to deepen their reforms , new changes will involve the establisher of legal structures to sustain high levels of foreign as well a domestic private investments . This will surely strengthen the law and regulations in the countries , especially , areas related to trade issues . __eou__ Several years ago , the countries and China singed memorandums of understanding , pursuant to which the countries will improve their laws government intellectual property rights protection over the following two to three years . __eou__ Precisely , the actions the countries have committed to take are consistent with TO agreement . __eou__
Mr . Brown , I'd like to talk with you about something that is getting to be a problem . I'd like , if possible , to see it settled at this meeting . __eou__ What is it , Mrs . Wang ? __eou__ It's about the quality of 300 cartons of dried mushrooms . They reached us two weeks ago , and were immediately examined after they arrived . To our astonishment , about 20 % of them were moldy and in many cartons there were even small brownish bugs crawling in and out of the half eaten mushrooms . We can't accept them in this state . They are unfit for human consumption . And the Medical Officer of Health has issued a Stop Notice on them . __eou__ Is that so ? So far we haven't had any complaint of this kind . Our mushrooms have enjoyed a good reputation for their superior quality for years . We are really at a loss to understand why your lot was found moldy and wormeaten . Have you any evidence ? __eou__ Certainly . Here's a survey report by a well-known lab in London , whose testimony is absolutely reliable . __eou__ Though everything may be as you say , there are many factors involved . What's more , your surveyors have not mentioned any cause for the damage . __eou__ The mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags , sixty of these bags to a carton . It is stated on the surveyor ? s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact . So it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing . __eou__ As you know , before shipment , the Commodity InspectionBureau inspected the goods in question . They concluded that the goods were well dehydrated from fresh and choice material and up to standard for export . __eou__ I think the Inspection Bureau at your end , when effecting inspection , only selected a few package at random these happened to be up to the standard . The part that was not dried properly , most probably , escaped their attention . As the amount in question is only 20 % of the whole shipment , I think it is only reasonable that you should compensate us for the loss . __eou__ The inspection certificate , which is based on a random selection of 20 % of the consignment as we've agreed on beforehand , is considered final and binding upon both parties . We do not accept any claims for compensation for loss incurred in transit , because you bought the goods F . O . B . Houston and on shipping quality , not on landed quality . Your claim , in our opinion , should be referred to the insurance company , as the mishap occurred after shipment . __eou__ We've already got in touch with the underwriter . But they have refused to accept any liability . They attributed the accident to the effects of dampness during the long sea voyage . __eou__ That's a matter over which we could exercise no control , then . I'm afraid I have to insist that you approach the insurance company for settlement , that is , if you have covered this risk in your coverage . __eou__ To my regret , we failed to cover contamination . This is an unfortunate oversight on our part and a lesson to us . __eou__ Otherwise the insurance company would no doubt have entertained your case . __eou__ Well , live and learn . It seems we'll have to waive the claim . __eou__
Ping-pong must be the top-ranking popular sport in China . It seems to me in every school , factory , army unit , or residential area , men and women , young and old , are swinging paddles . __eou__ You got it ! In a sense , it has become a byword for Chinese sport . __eou__ What do you think might be the source of its popularity ? __eou__ I think its critical advantage lies in its low cost . All you need is a racket , a table and a light celluloid ball . Tables are usually available in public recreation areas , like finest rooms , and outdoor playgrounds ... __eou__ And sometimes a substitute table can be made out of a few desks . __eou__ Put it there ! In senior high schools , we used to play on desks in the classroom , when no vacant tables were available . Likewise , the racket may take a variety of forms , too.Anything that resembles a racket , from a plank to cardboard or even a hardcover book , may be used as a racket . __eou__ Haha , these are very good inventions . All these speak the public's fondness for the sport __eou__ Yeah , the sport is affordable and accessible to every Tom , Dick and Jane in this developing country . No wonder even the state leaders are known to be keen on it . __eou__ I know President Hu Into likes playing ping-pong . __eou__ Actually , he excels in it . Chairman Mao , too , encouraged the whole nation to play ping-pong as a part of the nationwide body building campaign . __eou__ I see . There was also the famous ping pong diplomacy , wasn't there ? __eou__
This position demands a higher writing ability , so please say something about your writing ability . __eou__ Of course . I've loved writing since I was a very little boy . I won the first prize in a national composition contest when I was in middle school . After attending Nanjing University , I never give up writing . My works , such as Father's Tobacco Pipe , Open Air Cinema , The old City were respectively published China Youth Daily , Yangzi Evening News , and New Beijing . During the period of studying for my degrees of master and doctor , I paid more attention to developing my research ability and published several papers . The Impact of Internet in Chinese Political Participation , The Discipline of Remold , The Historical Direction of Chinese Administration Reform , Bribery Cases of Self governance in Chinese Villages are respectively published in Chinese Publish Administration , Beijing Due Xuebao , Theory and Society and Chinese Reform . I joined in Yangzi Evening News to work as a part-time journalist in 2006 . During this period , I've written a lot of comments , which improved my writing ability to a new level , I have full confidence in my writing ability , and I believe I can do the job well . __eou__
A Westerner said to his Chinese friend . “ Chinese people slurp when drinking soup . It ’ s disgusting . ” The Chinese friend replied , “ Westerners make a lot of noise licking their fingers when eating . It ’ s even worse . ” __eou__ Everyone has his own habits , but these habits are not very good . The noise often spoils other people ’ s appetite . __eou__ I attended a course on table manners while I was in the United States . Some of the things we learnt included how to place the napkin and utensils and how to pass the bread . Before each course , the teacher would ask if we wanted to learn the Continental European way or the American way . We always said “ American way . ” It ’ s amazing that everyone is so used to their own table manners . What is the Chinese way ? __eou__ The westerners use knives and forks to eat so it is complicated . The Chinese use a pair of chopsticks and eat out of the same plate . I assume it is less complicated , right ? __eou__ Not really . I did some research about Chinese table manners . The important rule is to remain silent while eating . Of course , this refers to family meals only . Not talking over meals is supposed to be good for the health . It is impolite if people do not talk to each other during a social party . The table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated . Each dish should be placed in the correct position . When fish is served , the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty . If it is in winter , the stomach should face the right-hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter . Each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table . The diners should sit close to the table so food won ’ t drop on their cloths . No noise should be made when chewing . No one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn ’ t like it . One should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise . All these table manners are very similar to Western habits . __eou__ It seems that people share the same basic sense of etiquette regardless of their background . Apart from the different tools used for eating we seem to follow the same principles . We do not let inappropriate manners spoil other people ’ s appetite.Westerners like to say , “ bon appetite ” before meals which is one way to suggest “ mind your table manners . ” Is there such an expression in Chinese ? __eou__ Yes . We say “ eat well and drink well . ” __eou__
Did you watch the Premiership last night ? __eou__ Yes , I watched United play Chelsea . What a fierce battle ! allay were engaged in intensive pressing and tackling in midfield . Well , it was not like a normal English League match . __eou__ No , it wasn't . Rather , it looked like a Bundesliga match , where physical contact is so frequent . English League teams are apt to pass the midfield quickly with long passes . It seems to me English soccer players are very gentlemanly . As Diego Maradona spoke teasingly , they often knew only chasing hard after the ball , but forgot to steal it . __eou__ Haha . That's probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common , and offsides more frequent in English League matches than those on the Continent . And the ball is often kept flying overhead , drawing beautiful curves in the sky . Such games are quite pleasing to the eye . __eou__ Which team do you back then ? __eou__ I'm a firm United supporter . I like their playing style . The Reds always have several excellent wing-backs , Like Riggs , Peckham and Gary Neville . They often make wonderful crosses when they assist in attacking . __eou__ But the Reds keep a weak midfield . I think Juventas of Italian Series A have always maintained a very formidable midfield . It is the main source of its strength . __eou__
Good idea ! I've heard that the Expo is doing pretty well now , and ads are seen everywhere in the country on all means of media , newspapers , TV , street signs , etc . __eou__ Yeah , it's the last world-wide horti-cultural exposition in the century , and one of the grand festivities of cross-century significance held by the China's tourism industry . __eou__ what's interesting to see there ? __eou__ Oh , there's plenty . Flowers and plants from all over the world , of course . Besides , gardening techniques are demonstrated , modern facilities displayed , academic exchanges and seminars organized , and folk performances of different nations shown almost every day . __eou__ I visited the First International Flower Festival in the city last year , and was impressed with so many beautiful flowers ! __eou__ Oh , can't compare with the Kunming Expo at all ! The Kunming Expo covers an area of 218 hectares , and more than 9000 flower enterprises from over 100 countries and regions are invited to participate in the Expo . __eou__ It would be a rare occasion to be able to appreciate so many fine species of Chinese and foreign flowers fully blooming in one park ! __eou__ Far more than that , I dare to say ! Inland provinces and cities , Hong Kong and Macao , as well as many countries and regions in the world have an exhibition area of their own to display their unique flowers and plants . Each month there's a special day for a particular country or region , and folk performances are given . You will feel it a great pity if you missile Kunming Expo . __eou__
I've been learning to play go recently . It's an amazing game ! __eou__ Weigh ? It must be a greatest Chinese invention . I've tried hard to learn it . Its rules can't be any simpler , but I've never won a game of Go . Well , it's all Greek to me ! __eou__ At least you have obtained a very basic understanding of the game , haven't you ? I think it is perfect for boosting intelligence , cultivating personality and flexible learning . Every intellectual wishing to gain any insight into Chinese culture should learn to play Go . __eou__ I heard it is included in the four major arts of China , is it ? __eou__ Sure . It was considered desirable that a well-educated ancient Chinese scholar could be well versed in zither , weigh , calligraphy and painting . I think weigh is the most fantastic of them . It embodies ancient Chinese wisdom and cultural profoundness . __eou__ I know it is quite different from Western chess . __eou__ Yes . Playing chess is a very aggressive experience . All the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . Whenever I start a chess game , I can't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill . __eou__ But isn't it the same with wiki ? __eou__ Certainly not . The object of weigh is to surround a larger area than the opponent . In other words , each side is struggling for a greater living space by mapping out a territory on the board . Hence , chess aims to kill , while weigh is most concerned with howso survive . __eou__
Trina , will you marry me ? __eou__ Yes ! Yes ! And yes ! Jared , of course I ’ ll marry you ! __eou__ Oh , Babe , I can ’ t wait to spend the rest of my life with you ! I can ’ t wait for all the adventures we ’ re going to have , for all the fights and the laughter . I can ’ t wait to grow old and wrinkly with you . __eou__ Oh , Jared ! I can ’ t wait for our wedding ! I hope you don ’ t mind , but I ’ Ve already chosen a date ! Six months from now in the summer ! Melissa saw you buying the ring last month so I ’ Ve had plenty of time to start planning ! __eou__ She what ? __eou__ Oh don ’ t worry , sweetie , I didn ’ t know when you were going to propose . It was still a nice surprise ! As I was saying , I ’ Ve got it all planned out . There ’ s almost nothing left to do ! I wrote up our guest list and we will have roughly four hundred guests attending . __eou__ Four hundred ? __eou__ No need to sweat it . My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding , which is going to be low-budget anyway . So roughly four hundred people , which means that the hall at Northwoods Heights will be our reception venue . I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents ’ church and my uncle of course would be officiating . We ’ ll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counseling . The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer . My step-sister and her string quartet will take care of that . My cousin will be the official photographer . I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo . Did you know that she ’ s going to be a professional opera singer ? __eou__ Ah ... __eou__ And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we ’ ll get the Youth Group to serve us . I was thinking that your friend ’ s band could be our entertainment for the night . though they might have to tone it down a bit . Or we could hire a DJ . Your sister ’ s husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings . what ’ s their name again ? I was thinking that we could have an island paradise-themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine . And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we ’ ll make our toasts ! What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors ? Who else am I missing ? Oh , your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake ! __eou__ Wow . __eou__ See ? It ’ s going to be wonderful ! Oh this wedding is going to be everything I ever dreamed of . __eou__ If I survive the next six months . __eou__
Look at this , A Brief Introduction of Hollywood . __eou__ Hackneyed theme ! __eou__ What ? How much do you know Hollywood ? __eou__ Nearly everything . __eou__ You are full of boasts . I can examine you by question and answer . What is Hollywood ? Where is it ? What is the function of it ? __eou__ Too easy questions . Listen carefully . Hollywood is the movie capital of the world.It is located in southern California . Many films have been made there , and the kinds have changed often . __eou__ Not bad . What kind of film did it produce from the ready to mid 1930 ' s __eou__ Gangster movies . Movie-goers at that time could get a look at the people involved in crime and their violent activities by watching it . __eou__ Mm . What came after that ? __eou__ After all that violence , people needed to laugh , so from the mid-to-late l940 ' s , many detective movies about policemen who solved crimes were made . Then came musicals . __eou__ Pretty good . Please continue . __eou__ Right . By the mid - 50 ' s , this light-hearted genre was competing with films about more serious subjects . There was one kind that could be found throughout all of these years , and that was the , mm , the . . . __eou__ The western films about America's cowboys , Indians and early settlers . __eou__ Come on . __eou__ Since the early 1960 ' s , there are horror movies about people who encounter frightening , unnatural situations , and serious films such as documentarist about events that actually happened , and science fiction movies about possible friture and future worlds . Some people have also enjoyed watching psycho-dramas about the everyday problems that people have . __eou__ Any more ? __eou__ Of course , no list of film would be complete without animated movies . These are especially popular among children . __eou__
Where are we going now ? __eou__ We are going to Jingshan Park . Originally it was an imperial garden while it is now a public park . __eou__ Where is it ? __eou__ It is at the north of Forbidden City , on the central axis of Beijing . __eou__ What can we see in it ? __eou__ Jingshan consists of five individual peaks , and there lies an elaborate pavilion on the top of each peak . These pavilions were used for gathering and leisure time . These five peaks also draw the approximate historical axis of central Beijing . __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ According to the dictates of Eng Shut , it is favorable to site a residence to the south of a nearby hill . When the capital was moved to Beijing , no hill existed at this location , so one was constructed . It is called " Coal Hill " . The last emper-or of Ming Dynasty , Chongzhen , committed suicide by hanging himself here in 1644 . __eou__ Tragedy . __eou__ Jingshan Park is especially a popular place for old people socializing and gathering . People can often find elder folks dancing , singing opera and other cultural activities at Jingshan Park . __eou__
I like chess better than xiangqi . And you ? __eou__ For my part , xiangqi . Maybe it's because my girlfriend is Chinese . __eou__ I think chess is more reasonable . You see , each side has eight pawns , a larger number than that of the soldiers in xiangqi . A true battle should be like that . Soldiers should outnumber the commanders . __eou__ Quite right . And unlike the soldiers in xiangqi , the pawns in chess can promote once they reach the furthest rank . It is very agreeable to grant merits to people with good performance . __eou__ Correct ! Another contrast is the rules for the general and the king . It seems the general or marshal in xiangqi is much too incompetent . They are required to stay in the palace , waiting to be checked and fleeing for life under the cover of the guards . Look at the king in chess , he is much more capable . __eou__ Yeah , and though the king in chess doesn't have bodyguards , he has a queen who is the most powerful piece . I think this demonstrates the relatively higher social status of aristocratic women in medieval Europe than in China . __eou__ There's another distinctive contrast . Both board games use a total of 32 pieces , but xiangqi is played on a 9 - by - 9 board , bigger than the 8 - by - 8 board used in chess . __eou__ You mean , xiangqi pieces are allowed a larger space in which to move around ? __eou__ Sure . On a chessboard , fire is much more intensive . It has a smaller board , while those bigger pieces-chariots , horses and bishops-can cover longer distances . __eou__
Which team do you think will emerge with the last laugh in this World Cup ? __eou__ I wish it could be Germany . But it seems they are not in a very good conditions . __eou__ No , they aren't . They had a hard time in the group stage and only sealed a sit in the eighth-finals with Wallack ' s header in the final three minutes . Just think , group A consists of Austria , China , and Saudi Arabia , all of which are minnows . __eou__ It seems they've been out of luck since the beginning of the event . Their shots hit the woodwork as many as six times . Oh . my goodness ! I'm afraid the team is under a spell . __eou__ Well , at least the Germans have demonstrated a very good ability to control the midfield . They recorded a total of 62 tackles in the match against Austria . And they to be endowed with perfect positional sense . I think that will give rise to scoring chances sooner or later . __eou__ I agree . Eeven though German attackers are not good at dribbling past opposing defenders , they breach the defensive line through quick movements to the right attacking positions and through accurate , well-timed passes . __eou__ That's why I still have very high hopes for the team . Now that the tournament has proceeded into the knock-out stage , the Germans will probably make it through to the finals . __eou__ Yes . They have a good reputation for their tenacity and discipline , especially in vital , decisive encounters . __eou__
People of different races are fit for quite different sports . For instance , Asians are especially good fattable tennis , badminton , diving and shooting . They seem to have been born with certain natural endowments in technical sports , in which flexibility , agility and quick reflexes are favorable . __eou__ And a typical example has been the Chinese athletes at the Beijing Olympics , right ? __eou__ Yes , in all these four sports . the Chinese Olympic dream teams led the way . They swept the floor against their opponents in table tennis and diving . __eou__ Then what are the Westerners fit for ? __eou__ I think they are in a better position in those sports that demand a high degree of intensity , speed and explosive force like swimming , field games , etc . __eou__ Where do you think the edge is for black athletes ? __eou__ It's common sense that African athletes always make a clean sweep in track events , middle or long distance races , relays , hurdles , barriers , and marathon . __eou__ I got you . Their competitive edge lies mainly in endurance and stamina . They are creatures from the savannah , and take to running like antelopes . __eou__
It's going to strike 12 o'clock . Let's get the firecrackers ready , Rose . __eou__ Aren't firecrackers forbidden in the city ? __eou__ Well yes , but they are not allowed only in downtown areas . It's OK here . It would be difficult to ban customs that have thousands of years of tradition . The habit does bring kids joy and excitement so long as precautions are taken . Let's go out and set off firecrackers out there . __eou__ Fantastic ! The whole city is echoing with crackling sounds ! __eou__ What other activities will you have tomorrow ? __eou__ Quite a lot . The celebration of the New Year has just started . The first day we southerners have sweet rice cakes for breakfast , and people in the North have Jiaozi . Afterward , we will make New Year calls on family relatives , husband's side on the first day and wife's side on the second . __eou__ Do you bring some gifts along ? __eou__ That's for sure . Fruit , cream cakes , medical tonics are often for parents and aged relatives , and cash enclosed in a red envelope for the kids . All this , of course , should be well prepared beforehand . __eou__ Is it the same practice for all families ? __eou__ Not all the same nowadays I must say . Many families , especially those of newly married couples , choose to make an overseas trip to escape the routines . Rose and I had a tour to Singapore , Malaysia , Thailand and Hong Kong last year . We stayed there for two weeks until the last day of the holiday . __eou__ I really appreciate the way you Chinese people exchange feelings . The holiday's long enough for you to relax . __eou__ Well , for city dwellers , the Spring Festival is a holiday of seven days . While in the country where traditions are still heavily emphasized , the festival lasts ten days . __eou__
Excuse me . May I see that laptop for a moment ? __eou__ Sure . You mean this one ? __eou__ No , the one on the left . Yes , that ′ s the one . ... Thank you . __eou__ It ′ s a state-of-the-art piece of equipment , sir . With a gigantic 16.1 USGA TFT screen , 2.8 Ghz mobile processor , generous 512 MB RAM , removable 80 GB hard drive , convenient CD-RW / DVD combo drive , stunning fast graphics board with 64 MB DDR DRAM , dual battery capability , integrated Fast Ethernet card , IEEE 1394 digital interface and eight USB ports , it has all the power of a desktop computer packed into an ultra-slim notebook ! __eou__ That ′ s impressive ! What ′ s the sale price ? __eou__ The regular price is $ 2980.00 , but until December the 31st it ′ s on sale for just $ 2,699 . 00 . __eou__
Are you watching another news report about the war ? __eou__ Yes . The two sides declared a short ceasefire but it broke down earlier today . Several military target were destroyed by bombing . Many civilians were among the dead and wounded . __eou__ How did this war start ? __eou__ Bout side claim a small area of territory . Both sides tried to build border fences and began attacking each other . __eou__ Politicians from both sides sound increasingly belligerent . Neither side wants to compromise . __eou__ Relief agencies report that many civilians are in desperate need of food and shelter . Several European countries have agreed to send aid , but are afraid that their planes will be shot down . __eou__ What do you think will happen ? __eou__ Both countries are very poor . Soon they will run out of money to finance the war . Then , perhaps , they will negotiate . __eou__ It would be much simpler and cheaper if they negotiated first . __eou__
If you go out recently you will find some people riding scooters in high streets and back lanes . __eou__ Yes . The German engineer would never dreamed that the hand - supported scooter he invented several years ago to solve his traffic problems would become so fashionable in the Occident within a few years and even spread to Japan and China . __eou__ Looking at the ' five sense organs ' of a scooter , it can be said as delicate and agile . To pull the T-shaped pole and make it vertical with the flat board and then pull it vertically , adjust its height suitable to you and you may use it . __eou__ Small and exquisite in size , easy to operate , foldable and easy to carry are its charms . __eou__ Your two hands hold the pole , stand on the board , the other foot steps back against the ground and controls well the balance of the body , then you can ride in the air . It has a feeling of surfing . You need not let other people teach you . Your fear will disappear quickly . __eou__
What type of people do you work with most effectively ? __eou__ I tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward.It ' s more difficult for me to be around timid people , because I move quickly and I am decisive . __eou__ What things impress you in your colleagues ? __eou__ I admire and work best with people who are of good character and integrity . I also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment . __eou__ What are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ? __eou__ The only thing I really don't like is to get feedback in front of others . I want to hear good and bad feedback in private , so that I have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions . I believe that's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior . __eou__ How do you organize and plan for major projects ? __eou__ I love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario.Then , I set a timetable that's realistic.What I usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because I've already visualized what could happen and how I'd react . __eou__ Describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure . __eou__ I had to complete an end of quarter report once while I was on the road for two consecutive weeks.The amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible , because I could't bring my office files with me.Luckily I had a great secretary and a logical filling system , so we located everything we needed . __eou__ How do you manage your time in a typical day ? __eou__ I've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk / return value.The last thing I do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which I take care of at the end of the day or week . __eou__ Describe a time when you acted on someone's suggestion . __eou__ I changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings . __eou__
Would you please explain for me what a business contract implies ? __eou__ A contract is an agreement which is binding on both parties mutually . A contract might be formal or informal , oral or written . An implemented contract is one which has been fully executed by both sides ; an executive contract is one which is going to be performed . They are enforceable by laws and any party who defaults the contract may be sued and forced to make compensation . __eou__ What are the purposes of contract ? __eou__ In an ordinary contract , the objective of a contract might be relatively simple , indicating the description of commodity , price , quantity , terms of payment and etc . __eou__ When we draft a contract , which points should we pay special attention to ? __eou__ Well . First , make meaning clear by using concise forma language . Second , describe accurately the exact requirement . Finally , state clearly the permissible variation in quantity . __eou__
Since China was open to the outside world , its trade forms have become much more flexible . One of these commonly used forms is co-production . Would you please do a bit explanation of it , Mr . Walker ? __eou__ Well , under this arrangement two parties cooperate to manufacture a product or a category of products , for example , machine tools for export . Each party produces and supplies a part of the components and parts ; one party is a Chinese enterprise , the other , an overseas firm . Most probably , the foreign counterpart contributes technology and equipment , and sometimes , parts and components , while the Chinese enterprises factory building , labor and other resources to the cooperative production . They join hands and fulfill orders together by an agreement or a contract . __eou__ I suppose that the assembling of these components and parts , particularly the marketing of the finished products should take place in China . __eou__ Not necessarily . It depends on the contract stipulations . They may be marketed in the foreign country where the other party is located , or even in a third country . __eou__ I think the principle of co-production is to expand export trade . It's a reciprocal business , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , you are right . Either party is not well-equipped to produce the final products single-handedly , but they can enter into an agreement . In such case , each side contributes different resources to make the manufacture of a certain product or a category of products possible . __eou__
We are free this afternoon , aren't we , Mr John ? __eou__ Yes , we are visiting the exhibition this afternoon , and look around Beijing city , wouldn't we ? __eou__ It's very kind of you , Mr John.the sightseeing trip between our business talk will be sort of our work division.business can be make for pleasure.what kind of exhibition we're going to see ? __eou__ It's industrial exhibition , in origin show the results of new industrial products in the city . a lot of products there to meet the needs of home and export __eou__ Could you give more detail information about some of the industries you just mentioned ? __eou__ Yes.take the oil industry for instance.you know there are twenty oil resources in China.you can see many chemical products in the exhibition.such as chemical fabrics as I dress . __eou__ What the others ? __eou__ There are chemical materials , medicines , rubber , plastics and so on , many products and meet the domestic markets , we are also trying to meet international markets . __eou__ How about textile industry ? __eou__ Textile is a traditional industry , which has completely catalogue , and solid basis and has developed in the past few years.the export is great , counting more than 25 % of export products __eou__ That's surprising , three days ago when I went to yancheng store , I saw different kinds of textile goods . I've bought some for my wife , some for my friends.they seem very attractive . __eou__ That's good . I think they must like them.in recently years , light industry have be developing in Standley , and place a credible role in our industry sister.these industry including leather , bikes , household electric products , clocks , sporting goods and so on.many of them are very popular at home and abroad . __eou__ I'm sure I'll enjoy seeing them.and will have more information of your city industry.what is more ?

I am an eloquent speaker in the classroom . But when I face a stranger outside , I get tongue-tied and nothing comes out . __eou__ You should pay close attention to your manner of speaking . Speech is a reflection of personality , you know . You should reflect confidence by speaking in a low voice , loud enough to be heard without being aggressive or overpowering . __eou__ I will go out of my way to catch the attention of the interviewer . __eou__ Your speech should not call attention to itself , but should reveal your individuality and ability . __eou__ I ’ m very shy . I think I might shake in my boots at the moment I meet the interviewer . __eou__ You ’ d better overcome your nervousness . it is considered an indication that you lack self-confidence . __eou__ Another problem is that I dare not look into their eyes whenever I meet strangers , especially foreigners . __eou__ In China , it is impolite to look into the senior speakers eyes while speaking . But in Western countries it is the opposite . Eye contact gives a strong feeling of sincerity . Looking downwards or sideways shows that you are either insincere or absent-minded . __eou__ Is there anything else that I should pay attention to in an interview ? __eou__ Yes . Don ’ t eat onions or garlic before you come . If you do you ’ ll have bad breath . __eou__ I ’ ll remember to bring gum with me . __eou__ You should never chew gum or smoke during an interview , even if you are allowed to do so . __eou__ I remember now . Your advice is very helpful . __eou__
Thank you all for coming to our monthly staff correlation meeting . Today we have a lot of new things to introduce to you all , there will be a lot of changes in company policy to accommodate better employee welfare . __eou__ Employee welfare ? What all does that include ? __eou__ In the past , our welfare program has consisted of benefits packages only , meaning partial health insurance coverage and retirement plan . But we hope to boost morale by increasing incentives and adding additional welfare considerations . __eou__ What kind of considerations are we talking about ? __eou__ It is proposed that from now on , employees will be given 10 paid sick days , in addition to their 2 week vacation periods . They will also be encouraged to maintain proper physical health with a company sponsored aerobics class on Friday nights . We have also consulted with the human resource department and have hired a new liaison between management and employees . Let ’ s all welcome Ms .

If you believe there is anything inappropriate or unfair in the management practices , the ombudsman will be the first person you seek . Her job is to have your best interest at heart . __eou__
Look , here're two coins named Kai Yuan Tong Bao — the sort of coin made in memory of the founding of a new dynasty . These two coins were made in different periods of the Tang Dynasty . __eou__ How can you tell the difference ? From what I see , they look almost the same . __eou__ The one made in the early Tang period is bigger and has more characters on it , while the one with smaller and elegant characters was made in late Tang period . Look carefully , and tell me if you see the difference now . __eou__ Yes , they are different ! But it's too professional . What I need is just being able to tell the real from the fake . Do you know any method we can use to tell a fake ancient coin ? __eou__ Various methods were used in history to produce fake coins . We usually send the coin to an authorized unit to have it tested by experts with special machines . We can judge it with naked eyes . __eou__ I see . By the way , China was more than once ruled by foreign tribes in history . Did they issue their own coins in China ? __eou__ Certainly , they did . Liao Coins and Song Coins , for example , coexisted in circulation during the Southern Song and Yuan period some 800 -1000 years ago . The Liao Coins look plain and bold in style , just like the characteristics of the Mongolian tribe . Let me look for one and show you . __eou__ If you happen to find one , please bargain with the owner for it . I'd like to have one . It's interesting to see the integration of the Han and Mongolian cultures on this small piece of metal . __eou__
Let's begin by having you tell me about yourself and your background . __eou__ I have been working as a paralegal for the last 10 months through an agency that specializes in the legal field . My experience has been supporting attorneys in the field of labor law , where I have been able to apply my paralegal education . I was commended on my ability to take information and break it down into usable facts . I really love research and analyzing facts . My major in college was English , and as a result , my writing skills are my major strength . I am looking for a position where my research and writing skills can be used . __eou__ What do you think are the key qualities needed to succeed in the paralegal profession ? __eou__ Flexibility would certainly rank high in this type of job . In my last position , I supported four lawyers , and it was not unusual for them all to give me high-priority items to do in the same day or week . There were days when I had to stop and prioritize my work just to get a handle on everything . I would discuss the urgency of their work with each of them so I didn't drop the ball . At the same time , I made sure each of them felt like his or her project was important on my agenda . I think communication is probably the next key quality . It really worked well when I talked with each of them , explained my situation , and got their input . __eou__ Can you give me an example of a time when you had to work above and beyond your job description ? __eou__ There was a very important project that had to be researched and completed by the end of the week . Even though I worked extra hours every night for almost two weeks , my boss and I stayed until 2 a . m . for two nights before the final wrap up . It was very rewarding to have put so much effort into a project and see the really great results . My boss gave me a bonus for my extra effort . __eou__ Tell me about a time when you had to research a case and encountered some obstacles you had to overcome . __eou__ I remember a case that was filled with obstacles . The first thing I did was research through documents and past cases that had similar circumstances . I assembled the facts and then tried to put them together and analyze the next step . I was able to get some input from another lawyer I happened to see at lunch . Through some hard work and fact digging , I was able to find a way to overcome most of the obstacles . I took my findings to my boss and made some recommendations , which she and I discussed and eventually resolved.My boss was impressed with the work I had done . __eou__ What are your strengths and weaknesses ? __eou__ My strengths are my caring about getting the job done . I am very results-driven and have been able to meet all my deadlines in past jobs . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But I am aware of my tendency to overwork and have learned to pace myself more . __eou__ Tell me about a time when you had a confrontation with a coworker or boss . __eou__ I did have an issue with someone who was getting on my nerves . I asked her if I could talk with her one day , and we had a good discussion . It turned out she was not aware of the impact of her actions and that she really needed an explanation of the procedure . I took the time to explain the procedures , and there haven't been any problems since that day . __eou__ When do you find a job satisfying ? __eou__ My biggest satisfaction is when I experience growth in a job . When I first started as a paralegal , I had a lot to learn . But through hard work , advice from some good mentors and continuing education , I have come a long way . I've learned to be flexible when possible and to deal with difficult people in a positive manner . __eou__ How would your coworkers describe you ? __eou__ First , they'll say I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm . I really enjoy working with people . Secondly , they'll say I had great customer service skills . I put the customer first . And thirdly , they'll say that I know the law . I put a lot of effort into my education as a paralegal and take it seriously . __eou__ Do you have any questions ? __eou__ Yes , I do . On a scale of one to 10 , what would you say morale was in this company ? __eou__
Now that you have learned Kung fu for a few months , what are your general impression of it ? __eou__ I think , maybe , it takes a real Kung fu master to give a more fair assessment ; meanwhile , I am no more than a beginner . But I really doubt whether kung fu would be of any great help when it comes to defending oneself in real life . __eou__ You mean , kung fu may not be so powerful as it is imagined ? To some extent your idea holds water . Kung fu was originally intended for self-defense , but with time it became something more than defense skills . Now we are apt to treat it as an art . __eou__ An art ! You have a good point there . So it is called martial arts in English . The Chinese are really capable of doing things nicely . They even made fighting a great enjoyment , so marvelous and fascinating . __eou__ Thanks for your compliment ! Perhaps the Chinese culture as a whole has a special inclination towards aesthetics . Do you know Jin Yong ? __eou__ I know he is a martial arts fiction writer . But I've read none of his novels . __eou__ All of his works have been translated into English . I recommend you to read one or two works of his . You'll get a general glimpse into Chinese kung fu culture . When you go through the pages , you are likely to feel they are not about kung fu alone , but cover all walks of life . __eou__ I see . They must have incorporated a series of Chinese cultural elements . __eou__ Yes , take philosophy , for instance . What makes a true , respectable da via , or a warrior hero ? It's not enough only to be formidable . It also involves a man's character , sense of justice , and values of life . __eou__ So kung fu is also a means of self-cultivation , isn't it ? __eou__ Indeed , you're exactly right ! __eou__
I am sorry to trouble you again , Mr.Stone . __eou__ It's ok . What do you want to ask ? __eou__ Where should I go after I arrived at the university ? __eou__ The first place you should go is the International Center . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ You can get help there in dealing with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service ; you can find Foreign Student Advisers . __eou__ What kind of role do foreign student advisers play ? __eou__ They'll discuss personal concerns , housing , adjustment , finances and other matters with you . __eou__ Can we get any more help at the International Center ? __eou__ Yes , a lot more . If you go there just before the beginning of the fall's semester , you can get your student ID and social security number there . They will keep your documents up-to-date . They will offer an orientation program for new comers . They will also help you contact your department and registration office . __eou__ I see . It must be worth going to . __eou__ Besides these , the center staff also works with community organizations which provide tours , home hospitality , speaking engagements and assistance for wives of foreign students . In cooperation with nationality clubs , student associations and other organizations , the International Center provides a varied program of cultural and social events throughout the year . __eou__ Wonderful . It is a home for foreign students . __eou__ It sure is . They also serve tea , coffee and refreshments . The Center staff members are also friendly and helpful . Everyone loves them . __eou__
In spring , people are feeling refreshed . They take off their heavy winter clothes and walk with a straight back and light steps . They feel they are full of spirits and energy . __eou__ Women in particular . They are anxious to get rid of those thick and clumsy winter suits and put on their new fashionable spring dress . __eou__ Well , when summer comes , the weather is hot and the leaves turn darkgreen ; the sun is blazing and the air is threatening . No one would like to stay in the open air for long . __eou__ That's true . In summer , the first place people want to go is a spacious room with air-conditioning or a quiet river or swimming pool . __eou__ I myself like very much to listen to the singing of some of the insects , especially the singing of cicadas . __eou__ In autumn , almost all fruits are ripe and all crops are waiting to be harvested . __eou__ And you can hear singing and laughing everywhere ! People are happy in autumn because autumn brings them harvest and richness and prosperity ! __eou__ Well , winter is a season for relaxation , do you agree with me ? __eou__ Well , it's hard to say . For the fields and rivers , winter is a relaxing season , but for farmers , I think they might take a rest physically , but mentally they are still busy thinking , planning and calculating for the working of the next year . __eou__ Maybe you are right . __eou__
Tell me about yourself . __eou__ I was born and raised in Beijing . I attended Peking University and received my bachelor's degree in Economics . I have worked for 2 years as a financial consultant in Beijing for China Pacific Insurance Co . Ltd . __eou__ What type of position are you looking for ? __eou__ I'm looking for a position in which I can utilize my experience . __eou__ Are you interested in a full-time or part-time position ? __eou__ I am more interested in a full-time position . However , I would also consider a part-time position . __eou__ Can you tell me about your responsibilities at your last job ? __eou__ I advised customers on financial matters . After I consulted the customer , I completed a customer inquiry form and catalogued the information in our database . I then collaborated with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client . The clients were then presented with a summarized report on their financial activities that I formulated on a quarterly basis . __eou__ What is your greatest strength ? __eou__ I am an excellent communicator . People trust me and come to me for advice . One afternoon , my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . I made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together . __eou__ What is your greatest weakness ? __eou__ I tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied . However , I began setting time-limits for myself . __eou__ Why do you want to work for our company ? __eou__ After following your firm's progress for the last 3 years , I am convinced that your company is becoming one of the market leaders and I would like to be a part of that team . __eou__ When can you begin ? __eou__ Immediately . __eou__
Tiffany , why are more and more people turning to the Web to find a mate ? __eou__ I think that , as more people use the Internet for both work and pleasure , it makes more sense as a tool to connect with people , and the stigma of meeting someone online is reduced . __eou__ There are actually special sites for people looking to date within their specific ethnic group and age group . But how should you screen potential mates ? Do you suggest talking to them on the phone right away or communicating via e-mail ? __eou__ I would say do not make the e-mail exchange too long . A lot of times a connection via e-mail creates almost a false sense of intimacy . Quickly make sure there is a connection in the physical world . __eou__ Can you give us any other safety tips for people pursuing relationships on the Net ? __eou__ I'd suggest you not give out too much personal information , like your home address , until after several dates . Just keep up the same guards you would keep up if you were meeting any stranger . __eou__ Besides the growth of these matchmaker sites , do you have any stats on success rates ? Are people out there finding true and lasting love through the Internet __eou__ Well , for a site like ecrush.com , since their debut in Valentine's Day in 1999 , of the 1.5 million people who have joined ecrush.com , 300000 have actually matched . __eou__ Do you have any successful stories to share ? __eou__ Yes , the couple that I highlighted at today's show met on Match.com and they're getting married this summer . __eou__
Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ? __eou__ I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it . To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ’ s better to get to know it . What about you ? __eou__ I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays . __eou__ Oh , my God ! John , I didn ’ t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory . __eou__ Come on , Han Maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion . __eou__ But I ’ m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ? __eou__ Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world . __eou__ I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ’ t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ? __eou__ That ’ s a little complicated . You ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ’ s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England . __eou__ Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ? __eou__ Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans . __eou__ How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ? __eou__ That ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries . __eou__ So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ? __eou__ Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College . __eou__ Why did they want to found a college ? __eou__ Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__ Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name . __eou__ When did it begin to be called Harvard University ? __eou__ In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman . __eou__ It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion . __eou__ Therefore , it ’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard . __eou__ Wow , I didn ’ t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history . __eou__ Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S . __eou__ I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard . __eou__ Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related . __eou__ That ’ s right . I have a lot to learn from you . __eou__ You can ask me any question at any time . __eou__
Why should I buy this MD player ? __eou__ Well , it has a lithium battery that lasts for 24 hours and it has a 160 second anti-skip mode for when you're playing sports . __eou__ What else ? __eou__ Using MP3 mode , you can download about 10 hours of music from either your CD player , or your computer's hard disk onto one mini-disk . __eou__ But how's the sound quality ? __eou__ You can choose from several play modes , or you can use the full-spectrum equalization , 3 D mode and Mega Bass features . We rec-ommend using it with the studio monitor headphones . __eou__ Is that it ? __eou__ It's ultra-compact , it has a brushed , titanium metal body and a rubber shock-proof , weather-proof case with a belt clip . __eou__
Some people are easily flimflammed . __eou__ Maybe they are still wet behind ears . __eou__ They are blind with bucks . Blind people are more easily conned , fo course . __eou__ Sure . Many people , including men and women , and be easily ripped off . __eou__
You are an early bird , Tom . What do you do in the morning then ? __eou__ Exercise . The morning hours are the most precious period within a single day . We should not pass them up easily . Seize the time and do something useful . __eou__ So , you choose to spend it on bodybuilding . Where do you exercise ? __eou__ Usually , I run to the Black Bamboo Park as a warm-up . Admission is free . Then I start my activities . __eou__ Do you do the same exercises every day ? __eou__ No , I've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars , push-ups , sit-ups , bunny-hops , five-kilometer run , and so on . I alternate them over the weekdays . Sometimes , when I find myself in a bad state , I will simply idle about in the park . __eou__ Why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ? __eou__ It's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . I fear that if I fail to get up early one day , I may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . Besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . Here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . It's interesting to join them . __eou__ Oh , yes . Singing is also a good way of keeping fit , at least mentally . __eou__
That new Sony camcorder you've got is just beautiful . __eou__ Yeah.It is the very latest in digital video cameras . __eou__ I can see digital video products are quickly going mainstream with their plunging price . __eou__ Getting cheaper is not the only reason for their popularity.They come with a lot of inviting functions . __eou__ Such as ? __eou__ They offer clearer and sharper images . Many of them also have up to 20x optical zoom lenses , a photo mode and fast-action mode . __eou__ They are very compact and are designed to be used with one hand . __eou__ Right ! Anyway , the basic difference between a digital camcorder and its traditional counterpart is that it speaks digital . __eou__ What does this mean ? __eou__ This means digital camcorders can be connected with the digital equipments you have at home , like your digital TV or your computer . __eou__ I can transfer my home video clips from my camcorder to my computer for editing . __eou__ Sure ! And without any conversion process or loss of quality ! You quickly find , cut , and record video segments and create slide shows . Some camcorders even offer editing software for adding titles and special effects . __eou__ What special effects ? __eou__ Like creating a sepia tone look and some special effects such as fades and dissolves . __eou__ That's great ! __eou__ With the development of the broad band Internet , you can easily upload your video files to websites or e-mail them to relatives or business partners . __eou__ So everybody's getting video mail . __eou__
Thanks for coming in today , did you have any trouble finding us ? Please take a seat . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ So , let ’ s get started . tell me a bit about your educational background . __eou__ Sure ! Well , I graduated with honors from Chesterton University with a major in Business Administration , with a specialization in Information Management , and I minored in psychology . I chose this course of study for two reasons . I wanted to gain some practical , marketable skills , which the information management track provided , and I also feel that interpersonal skills are essential for professional success , hence the minor in psychology . __eou__ Interesting . And , your postgraduate studies ? __eou__ Well , I am really passionate about consumer behavior , so I pursued a master ’ s in that area . I also strive to keep my professional skills current , so I continuously attend seminars and conferences related management and customer service . __eou__ Very good . Now , tell me a little bit about your work experience . I see here that you previously worked at Oracle . __eou__ Yeah , I worked as their customer support manager , which brought me a breadth of experience in both client care , and process management . I supervised and coordinated the customer support team as well as implemented new strategies to achieve better customer satisfaction . __eou__ Interesting ... __eou__ Yes , in this position I was able to make some pretty significant contributions to the overall success of the company . With the different initiatives that we implemented , we lowered our churn rate to about five percent , which had a direct impact on revenue . __eou__
Are the children all grown up now , Rose ? __eou__ Oh , yes . Laura ’ s the oldest . She ’ s a computer programmer . __eou__ Oh , very interesting . And what about Rita ? She was such a bright child — always reading . __eou__ She ’ s a librarian at the public library . __eou__ Really ? And Chris ? She was a very pretty little girl . __eou__ Christy is working as a waitress at a restaurant in Paris . She ’ s married to a French photographer . __eou__ Oh , how interesting . And what about Larry and Rocky ? __eou__ Larry drives a truck . He drives all over the country . We hardly ever seen him . __eou__ Really ? Where does he live now ? __eou__ Colorado . __eou__ And does Rocky drive a truck , too ? __eou__ Oh , no . Rocky is a pilot . __eou__ Really ? Where does he fly ? Does he fly to other countries ? __eou__ Yes . Mostly to England and France . __eou__
Uncle Ben , how did the Forbidden City get this name ? __eou__ Well , in the feudal society , emperors had supreme power , so his residence was certainly a forbidden palace . __eou__ His residence ? You mean the whole palace ? __eou__ Yes . The Forbidden City is divided into two parts . The southern section , or the Outer Court was for the emperor to exercise his power over the nation , and the northern part , or the Inner Court was for his royal family . __eou__ Oh , unbelievable . This was too luxurious . __eou__ Even the whole country belonged to him . That's why he is called the emperor . __eou__ OK , then . I love these unique structured towers with the delicate carvings on them . It's really artistic . __eou__ Yeah , the buildings and designs of the Forbidden City are the peak of Chinese traditional architecture , not only scientific but also suitable for living . __eou__ I agree . It's definitely a product of wisdom . Well , why were those small animal sculptures placed on the tops of the buildings ? __eou__ Some of them are mascots and some are symbols of power . __eou__ Why are there so many yellow things ? Is yellow the lucky color in China ? __eou__ Oh , no . In fact , yellow is the symbol of the royal family . __eou__ Just like the pattern dragon , right ? __eou__ Exactly . Here is the Nine-dragon Screen . __eou__ Oh , it's really fabulous . I wanna take a picture here . __eou__ Sure , this will be a really good picture . __eou__
I saw on TV that there is an entertainment item , bungee in Beijing Longtanhu Park . Except that the height is not exiting enough . __eou__ You say how high can be exciting ? __eou__ The highest bungee spot in the world is located in Mount Kikicama , South Africa , which is 216 meters high . A cable car in a scenic spot in Switzerland is 160 meters high . __eou__ I know that Frenchmen installed the Bungee cord between two tall buildings . __eou__ It is said that Bungee was originally a grown-up ceremony of the indigenous people of New Guinea . People stood on branches of the tree , which was over 30 meters high . Their feet were fastened with canes and they jumped off from where they stood . When they almost reached the ground , they suddenly stopped to prove their bravery and express that they were able to endure the hardships of life independently . __eou__ Luckily there is no such kind of ' grown-up ceremony ' any more . __eou__
Welcome back movie lovers to another Premier Movie Review . My name is Richard Clarke and I am joined today by the very erudite DavidWatson . __eou__ Thank you Dick . Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King . Tell me Dave , what is your impression of this film ? __eou__ Well , I think this film is simply a fable , depicting man ’ s eternal greed for power , and in my opinion , it ’ s a very fine film . Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries.The musical score was amazing , the animation was very well done , and the story was simply enchanting . __eou__ I think otherwise . Even though the animation was technically strong , and as you say , the score and songs performed by Elton John were great , the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart . And I would dare to say , it was too predictable . __eou__ Predictable ! How ! Come on Dick , It ’ s a G-rated movie ! It ’ s for the kids ! It ’ s not a thriller ! __eou__ Well , that ’ s just it . It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes For example when Mufasal dies , or the dark , grim portrayal of Scar . Even so , the film is linear . Mufasal dies , Simba runs away thinking it ’ s his fault . Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his . It ’ s just too cliche . __eou__ How can it be cliche ? It ’ s a fable ! It ’ s telling a time-honoured story ! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption , and teaches children the value of respect , life and love . __eou__ You have always been so soft , Dave ! __eou__ Open your heart Dick . Don ’ t shut us out . __eou__ Anyway ... That ’ s all for today folks ! Join us next time as we talk about & quot , How to lose a guy in 10 days & quot , I ’ m sure you ’ ll love that one Dave ! __eou__
I'm reading an interesting report on Mars . __eou__ Oh , what does it say ? Does it say water could still exist under the surface of Mars ? __eou__ Absolutely ! It says there is water on Mars buried beneath the surface . It's just a matter of how deep it is . __eou__ Then could the soil on Mars somehow be fertile enough to Groh simple plants ? __eou__ The soil would need quite a bit of fertilizer to grow anything . And it would need to be protected from the UV radiation . __eou__ Actually , we are doing a project in school that involves landing a ship and staying on Mars for an extended period of time . Does NASA have any type of portable habitats that could be used to stay on the planet ? __eou__ I'm not sure NASA has built any portable habitats for extended stays on Mars , but they have looked at various designs . __eou__ One of the most exciting things about Mars is that there could have bean life on it . What are your personal opinions on the life on Mars theory ? __eou__ Well , I'm not really an expert in this area , but my understanding is that anything is possible . It's just that it is so hard to determine what went on 4.5 billion years ago . __eou__ But maybe there is a chance of gradually improving the surface and atmosphere of Mars so it may be inhabitable by humans . __eou__ I'm skeptical . Mars is made of rocks containing silicon , iron , and various minerals . It also has an atmosphere of carbon dioxide . It is so different from what we have on earth , you know . __eou__ I'd still like to hope that some day we could set up a human colony there . __eou__ But there are still other big problems we need to solve such as prolonged weightlessness , food storage , and a series of physiological effects . __eou__
What companies are stockholders in this company , do you know ? __eou__ Yes , the main stockholder is International Business Machines Corporation , namely , IBM for short . __eou__ What section would you like to work in if you enter this company ? __eou__ I wish to work in the planning department . __eou__ What type of work will you expect to do at first ? __eou__ I expect to operate computers . __eou__ What are your plans for the future ? __eou__ I wish to move up to higher positions with acquisition of more experience in the future . __eou__ How long does it take to get here from your home ? __eou__ It's a twenty-minute bus ride . __eou__ How long do you think that we can depend on your working here ? __eou__ I ’ ll work here as long as you expect me to . __eou__ You are single now , but what will you do when you get married ? __eou__ I ’ Ve thought about that a lot . I know that many women take a job , planning to make a career of it , and then they change their mind . But I am hoping to make it my lifetime work . So if I get married , I will find some ways that I can continue my work . __eou__ Do you think you will want to continue working here even after you ’ Ve had a child ? __eou__ I think so . __eou__ What ideas do you have if we employ you ? __eou__ Ever since I was a young girl , I ’ Ve been clever with my hands . I ’ Ve always enjoyed doing detailed work . If I could use that ability to make your products a little better and to benefit the company , I would be happy . __eou__ Do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ? __eou__ No , nothing in particular . __eou__ If you are employed by us , how are you going to do your part of the work ? __eou__ I'll first get further information about our goals , ways , counterparts and management , etc . . Then I ’ ll make my plan . And then I ’ ll go with all my effort to see it is realized . __eou__ If you fail to do your work well , what are you going to do ? __eou__ I ’ ll report it honestly . I ’ ll give a correct analysis . I may quit the job - and pay compensation . But I have my way to judge whether I fail . __eou__ What do you think if you do not have much spare time on this job ? __eou__ People are supposed to work hard within regular work time , especially when it is an important work that is highly paid for . I don ’ t mind work over spare time if it is paid for . __eou__ What are your expectations from working on this job ? __eou__ Getting more experience with a widely-known company like yours . Using my speciality in marketing and management . And getting advancement in salary and position . Show my enterprise , confidence and character in passing . __eou__ If you were choosing a person for this job , what kind of individual would you select ? __eou__ I would select the individual that has the most qualifications among all the applicants . He doesn ’ t have to be the person if we have to fill the vacancy . But he has to be the best , even if we have to pay him higher . __eou__ If we do not employ you , what are you going to do ? __eou__ I will feel it is a pity . But I will not feel so bad . I will go for other interviews until I am employed satisfactorily . Hopefully before I find another position , you will call me back . __eou__
Is the factory fully-automated ? __eou__ Not completely . Our production process is partially-automated . We use robots on the production line for routine assembly jobs but some of the work is still done manually . __eou__ What about supply of parts to the production line ? __eou__ Well , the parts are automatically selected from the store room using a bar-code system . And there is an automatic feeder which takes them to the conveyor belt at the start of the production line . __eou__ What about the smaller components ? __eou__ They're transported to the workstations on automated vehicles - robot trucks - which run on guide rails around the factory . __eou__
The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest . __eou__ Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? The same is true in the West . __eou__ No , absolutely not ! On the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . But always pay attention to what you say . If the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested . __eou__ You mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? That goes in like with Confucius ' preachings , right ? __eou__ Correct . Show respect for the older people . Conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other . __eou__ Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ? __eou__ Yes , plenty of them . Don't eat fast ! People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely . __eou__ Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ? __eou__ Haha , I'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate . __eou__
Welcome to our show ! Today , I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich ! Are you ready ? Let ’ s get started ! __eou__ Let ’ s start with the basics , bread . Bread is an important ingredient here . You need to remember one thing - choose the bread according to the following criteria , freshness , crumb and color . If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven , or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color . __eou__ Now that our bread is ready , let ’ s talk about the ingredients ! Of course , each person ’ s palate is different , but I ’ m going to give you a few tips that you ’ ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich . I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich . __eou__ Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light . The best choices here are evident — cucumbers , tomatoes , onions , sweet pepper or chilli , lettuce and , of course , herbs — you can ’ t go wrong with them . As for aubergines , mushrooms and asparagus , I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil . __eou__ Last but not least , we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich . We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper , or we can combine mustard sauce , mayonnaise , ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor ! It ’ s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt ! __eou__ That ’ s all the time we have for today , but join us next time where we ’ ll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna ! Till next time ! __eou__
OK , I just want to brief you all on the travel market in Taiwan . To start with , generally speaking , the travel industry in Taiwan focuses mainly on tours . This segment of the industry is well developed . __eou__ Sorry to interrupt , Doris , but can you tell me more about these tour groups , what kind of things they enjoy , and so on ? __eou__ Yes , of course . Most of the time , when they travel , they prefer to do so in large groups accompanied by a guide , who usually takes care of everything , for instance , choosing the restaurants , the itinerary , the mode of transport , and things like that . Another thing is that most travelers to the UK tend to be middle aged , around 40 to 50 or so . This age group is less adventurous ; they like good hotels , and have money to spend . They kind of prefer to stay in the cities where they feel safer . They are not into mountain climbing in Wales or anything . __eou__ I don ’ t mean to interrupt , but can you tell me what plans you have for growing the youth market ? __eou__ Just a moment . I'll tell you about that in a minute . Where was I ? Oh yes . By way of illustration , let ’ s look at the top five destinations in the UK for this kind of traveler over the last five years . If you look at page ten you can see what I mean . In spite of these characteristics of the market , I still think there is room for growth in the youth sector . __eou__ So how do you intend to do that ? __eou__ OK , let me tell you what we ’ Ve been doing . We ’ Ve been in touch with the Wales and Scottish Tourist development offices here in Taiwan and they ’ re interested in working with us to promote their regions to the youth segment . We ’ Ve decided to implement an advertising campaign focusing on the excitement of the activities in those regions . __eou__ May I interrupt you for a moment ? __eou__ Go ahead . __eou__ How much is it going to cost , and who is going to pay ? __eou__ Well , at the moment we are trying to work out those details . We haven't managed to come up with a concrete plan yet , but we are working on it . __eou__ I see . OK . So what ’ s next ? __eou__ Well , our intention is to have some features about these regions in some youth magazines . We ’ re also going to run some ads on TV and put some flyers in places where young people go , like the gym and student organizations . We ’ re making arrangements to have some activities at big shopping malls and department stores around town . __eou__
I'm planning to buy a bicycle . As you are quite a cycling enthusiast , I wish you might give me some advice . __eou__ With pleasure , chap . But before I start , I need to know what you want a bike for ? __eou__ My purposes are two-fold . On the one hand , I've grown bored of commuting on suffocating buses every day and decided to ride to work . On the other hand , bicycling is a sport , and I intend to build up my body through constantly taking a ride over the weekends . __eou__ Cycling during weekends ? Do you me riding on the mountainous countryside just the neighboring towns ? __eou__ Does that make any difference ? __eou__ Can't be greater . If you ride on bumpy , hilly roads , a mountain bike is what you need . But if you just ride comfortably along the city lanes , you might choose a road bike . __eou__ Are they designed differently ? __eou__ A road bike features skinny tires and a light-weight frame . Its riding position puts you bent over the handlebars . It's not particularly beefy in construction , and generally , it won't stand up well under heavy loads or on really rough surfaces . In contrast , mountain bikes have wide tires and a stout frame . You sit higher on them and don't have to hunched over . __eou__
What did you cook ? __eou__ Well , as you know I was in Thailand last month , and I took a cooking class ! So I prepared some of my favorite dishes . __eou__ Great idea ! As long as I don't get food poisoning ! So what is on the menu tonight ? __eou__ Ok , for starters we have Tom Yam soup . It's a bit spicy , but really good ! __eou__ This is delicious ! The ginger and lemongrass really gives it a nice taste ! __eou__ Now this next dish is one of the most famous . Foreigners call it papaya salad but the proper name is Tom Sam . It is a spicy salad made from a mix of fresh vegetables including shredded unripened papaya and tomato . __eou__ This is delicious ! The combination of sour and spicy is really interesting ! I could have this everyday ! __eou__ Ok , now for the last and best dish in my opinion . This is called Pad Thai . It's stir-fried noodles with eggs , fish sauce , tamarind juice , red chili pepper plus bean sprouts , shrimp and tofu and garnished with crushed peanuts and coriander . It's practically Thailand's national dish ! __eou__ Wow , this is great ! I never knew Thai food was so creative and delicious ! __eou__ Want some more ? __eou__ I'm stuffed ! __eou__
Come in , please . __eou__ Good afternoon , Mrs Smith . __eou__ Good afternoon . Have a seat , please . You are Mr . Sun ? __eou__ Thank you . Yes , I am Dunlin . __eou__ I have read your resume . I know you have worked for 3 years . Why did you choose to major in mechanical engineering ? __eou__ Many factors led me to major in mechanical engineering . The most important factor is I like tinkering with machines . __eou__ What are you primarily interested in about mechanical engineering ? __eou__ I like designing products , and one of my designs received an award . Moreover , I am familiar with CAD . But I can do any mechanic well if I am employed . __eou__ Why did you decide to apply for this position ? __eou__ Your company has a very good reputation , and I am very interested in the field your company is in . __eou__ What do you think determines an employee's progress in a company such as ours ? __eou__ Interpersonal and technical skills . __eou__ We have several applicants for this position . Why do you think you are the person we should choose ? __eou__ I have the abilities , qualities and experience that you requested in your job advert , for example I have three years experience in designing products and I got leadership experience while serving the college student union as president . __eou__ That sounds very good . How do you see your career development ? __eou__ After a few years of gaining experience in the company and furthering my professional qualifications I'd like to put my experience and skills to use in management . I want to become a supervisor in your R & D department . __eou__ Have you anything to ask about the job ? __eou__ Yes . Do you offer any opportunities for further study ? __eou__ Yes . If you undertake additional courses , provided these are approved , and you complete them successfully , you can claim back part , quite a large part , 75 % of the costs you incurred . Not just the fees , - traveling and other expenses too . __eou__ That's fine . __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ No . __eou__ Well , thank you very much , Mr . Sun . I'll let you know the result of the interview as soon as possible . Goodbye . __eou__ Thank you , Mrs . Smith . I do hope the answer will be favorable . Goodbye . __eou__
What kind of jobs are becoming popular in your country ? __eou__ As in many countries , there ’ s been a big growth in anything related to computers . Young people are attracted to that field in particular . There ’ s also been a big growth in education . __eou__ There ’ s been a growth in that field in my country too . A lot of people want to learn practical and professional skills . __eou__ The interesting thing is that many of the teachers are not actually trained teachers . They are usually professionals who are taking a break from their jobs to pass on skills to others . __eou__ I noticed that too . What are the people learning ? __eou__ In my country , they are usually studying something business-related , such as marketing , management techniques , and human resource management . __eou__ I think that jobs in the leisure industry will become more popular in the future . __eou__ That trend has already begun in my country . In particular , there ’ s a big demand for people to work in fitness centers . Which kinds of jobs are less in demand ? __eou__ Those in traditional fields , such as agriculture and heavy industry . Younger people are not interested in doing those jobs and other countries have industries that can produce things much cheaper . __eou__ Yes . My country is certainly expanding in the service and hi-tech sectors , but contracting in the heavy industry and primary industry sectors . However , our car and aircraft manufacturers are doing very well . __eou__ They are well known for high quality , that ’ s why . __eou__
What's our target audience for this campaign ? __eou__ This go-around we're focusing on new moms , families with median income and one or more children under the age of two . __eou__ Do you think that's much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for ? __eou__ Well , there are some similarities that come up . Because both groups are made up of mothers ... so as before , we can play up on maternal instincts , hygiene , safety , along those lines . But that being said , there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here . __eou__ Right , that makes sense . What's the average age ? __eou__ Demographics say an average age of 28.7 , educational background of university or post-grad , annual household income of 40-50 K a year . __eou__
First of all , I would like to thank you for your kind invitation to visit your beautiful country . I hope my visit will help to promote a friendly relationship between us . __eou__ We've been looking forward to your visit . It is a great pleasure for us to have you as our guest . It is always more convenient to discuss things face to face . __eou__ I would like to tell you that my clients are very satisfied with the last delivery of your slippers . The styles and colors are very much to the taste of our market . __eou__ We've received some similar comments from other Australian firms too . __eou__ I understand you are selling the same products to some other Australian importers . This tends to complicate my business . As you know , I am experienced in the business of slippers and enjoy a good business relationship with all the leading whole - sabers and retailers in that line . I have a mind to expand this business in the years to come . One of the reasons of my visit here is to sign a sole agency agreement with you on these items for a period of 3 years . As it is to our mutual interests and profit , I am sure you'll have no objection to it . __eou__ We appreciate your good intention and your effort in pushing the sale of our slippers . As you know , the demand for this item in your market is quite substantial . However , according to our records , the total amount of your order last year was moderate , which does not warrant an agency appointment . Unless you increase the turnover we can hardly appoint you our sole agent . __eou__ I'll come to that . My proposal is __eou__ As far as I remember , we sold about 40,000 pairs last year to you alone . Don't you think this annual turnover is rather conserve - time for a sole agent ? __eou__ Well , I admit I always do business on the safe side . Could you let me have your proposal then ? __eou__ Let's put it this way . I propose a sole agency agreement for Ladies and gents plastic slippers ( excluding children's ) for a duration of 3 years ; 60,000 pairs to be sold in the first year , 70,000 pairs in the second year , and 80,000 pairs in the third year , the area is to be within the continent of Australia ( excluding any neighboring island ) , commission 5 % . __eou__ You certainly drive a hard bargain , Mrs . Brown . __eou__ On the contrary , Mr . London , we value your friendship more than anything else . We both understand our slippers are very popular in your market on account of their superior quality and compete - time price . And with the sole agency in your hand , there will be no competition and you can easily control the market , which would naturally result in bigger sales . I'm sure you can fulfill the agreement without much difficulty . __eou__ Well , if you put it this way , I'll have to comply . When shall we sign the contract , Mrs . Brown ? __eou__ Tomorrow afternoon . __eou__ Tomorrow afternoon will be fine . __eou__
What is the most unexpected thing you experienced in space ? __eou__ I wasn't quite prepared for the view of the Earth as we left . It was just awe-inspiring . It emerged from just a slightly curved horizon to a whole Earth , where you could look across oceans and continents in a single glance . I wasn't quite prepared for that . It's inevitably etched in my memory . __eou__ When viewing the Earth from space , do you feel detached from humanity or more a part of the totality of humankind ? __eou__ Detached . You're literally detached from one planet , captured by another . Your only link to reality is the Earth out there ; fortunate - 1y , it stays in view the whole time . __eou__ There're a lot of suspicions that the International Space Station is never going to become reality . Is it going to be some future project that never happens ? __eou__ I believe it's certainly for real . It without question has suffered a lot of delays . But there's hardware sitting on the pad right now and it's due to go off in December . It is a reality . It has just taken longer to get literally off the ground . __eou__ There were a lot of talks during the Bush administration about a not too distant future Mars mission . It seemed to fizzle out . Do you think that this Shuttle mission will reignite the public's passion for space and get us to Mars sooner ? __eou__ I hope this flight is not just a one-time affair , that it does re-ignite people's interest to push on . But only time will tell . __eou__ You had gone to the moon twice , orbited space around the Earth lots of times , and of course you have had the most amazing views that a human being can have . How long do we ordinary beings have to wait to feel the weightlessness ? I just can't wait . __eou__ If I were the man making the decisions , you could get in line tomorrow . I strongly support ordinary people going into space . Unfortunately , I don't think it will be in the near future . __eou__
Do you believe in horoscope fortune-telling ? __eou__ I used to be an atheist . But in recent months , I couldn't but form a more favorable opinion of horoscope . __eou__ That sounds interesting . Have you been involved in any mystery ? __eou__ Not exactly , except that I find horoscope predictions increasingly accurate . I came upon a website which sends me an up-dated message by e-mail each day forecasting my experience in detail . It is amazing to find these forecasts largely in line with my daily life . __eou__ What did it say about you then ? __eou__ For example , the message for the day before yesterday notified me that I , as a Leo guy , was to have some " unusual experience in food and drink . And as it turned out , the reality matched this prediction well . Lasi night , I was treated to a dinner party by Mr . Lee . __eou__ But it must have been only a coincidence . That's the only way superstition wins over science . __eou__ Oh , no . You can never tell whether such-and-such is science or sheer fraud.If horoscope is really something deceptive , how come quite a size of proportion of young people think highly of it . __eou__ For fun . It serves as a shared topic to them.While they claim to consult the predictions constantly and marvel at their " accuracy ' . they do not necessarily take them seriously . When it that these predictions are matched by their real-life experiences , they delight in spreading the thrill with friends . But if there isn't any correlation between reality and predictions , they just grin , forget about them , and go on living as usual . __eou__
Does tea-serving follow any special etiquette in China ? Each time I dropped in at my Chinese friends ' homes , their parents would offer me a cup of hot , strong tea , though they never inquired of me about whether I want it . __eou__ You've got a point there . It is a custom and good manners to serve tea to a guest who comes to pay a visit . There is no need to ask if he needs it or not , or if he wants something else . It might be an insult to the guest if he is left sitting there without being served tea . __eou__ So the guest is presumed to be thirsty and in need of some drink after the trip . In that case , I guess , in return , the guest doesn't have to drink it if he wouldn't like it . __eou__ It wouldn't be considered rude behavior if he doesn't even take a single drop . But he'd better receive the teacup with both hands and bow his thanks when the cup is brought before his face . When the host pours hot water into his cup , he may also choose to tap his index finger on the table , meaning " Thanks " . No matter if he likes it or not , it is impolite if he doesn't even lay a finger on the cup . __eou__ So next time , I'd better take a few sips , to ' save face ' at least , right ? __eou__ Sure . The guest is welcomed by being served tea . But if after chatting for a while , the host asks servants or family members to serve a new cup of tea , or add some hot water , he is giving another signal . __eou__ What does that imply , then ? __eou__ More often than not , the understatement is ' I'm afraid it's time you leave ' . __eou__
What reasons do westerners drink for ? __eou__ I don't think drinking requires any special purposes . For us people in the West , the purpose is generally quite simple-to savor the wine . __eou__ I know what you mean there . In many circumstances , people kiss the baby for the nurse's sake . And that's what we do when drinking at a banquet . Even though we do have a rich variety of brand-name wines , like Matai and Showing Yellow Rice Wine , alcohol is usually served not for the enjoyment itself . We just be its Dionysus effect to enliven the atmosphere , improve personal association with each other and solidify friendship . __eou__ And to make matters worse , you're urged to drink " one more cup time and again.There is too much etiquette to observe . You'II be set free at a Western banquet It seems we are keen to make it convenient as possible to savor the wine , its color , its aroma and its delicate taste . __eou__ Yeah . It's of supreme importance that the goblet , table-cloth , and plates should be made shiningly clean , so that the color of the wine is clearly visible and the delicate aroma and taste are fully appreciable . __eou__ Yes . For me , who can't hold much liquor , it's particularly agreeable . If only I had thechance to enjoy Chinese Matai at a leisured pace while sitting at a Western banquet ! __eou__
Did you see the 2005 Grammy Awards on TV last night . __eou__ Yeah . I was so happy , because my favorite singer , Ricky Martin won ' Best Latin Pop Performance ' . __eou__ He seems to win awards everywhere . __eou__ He is really great . He has sold millions of records worldwide . He is especially known for his rocking performance at the football World Cup song-the Cup of World . __eou__ I heard one observer even said ' It was a song sung in Spanish for international football , and he made it so popular that even the Americans loved it . ' __eou__ That's right . His voice ranges from the smooth sound of ballads to the highpowered rhythms of the Spanish Caribbean where he grew up . He has fan clubs across the world , from America to Russia , from England to Taiwan , from Norway to Australia . __eou__
What's your ideal boss ? __eou__ I have had an incredible boss , who was my direct supervisor during the last year of my coop work experience . A-bout two months after I began working for her , she really let me spread my wings . She encouraged me to work independently , because she said she had come to trust my judgment and commitment . So I was able to move forward on projects without having to check in with her every day . Of course , I made certain that she knew what I had accomplished on a daily and weekly basis because I gave her summary reports , although she didn't specifically ask me to . Without her support and encouragement , I don't think I would have felt confident enough to have written up a proposal suggesting that the department change a process that had been in place for a long time . But she was open to suggestions , so long as employees could back them up with research and facts . When I submitted my suggestion , she reviewed it and told me where she thought it needed more work . She then took my revised proposal to her boss . He was a more conservative type , but she lobbied him to try It for several weeks . He did , and it was so successful that it was instituted as a permanent change . I've also worked for some very difficult bosses in summer and part-time jobs . And while I'd certainly prefer to work for one like I've just described , I'm the kind of person who can get along with just about anyone . __eou__
Did you working in a similar position before ? __eou__ Yes . I have been with ABC Insurance Company for four years , and before that , I worked with the Pacific surveyor company as claim officer . __eou__ Could you tell me the usual procedures to handle such a case ? __eou__ Yes , on the shipper's side , when the cargos arrives , all relevant documents will be forwarded to the consignee.Among other things , this party has to check carefully the content of the packing list and weight list.When cargos are found to be damaged of short landed , this party has to call for a joint survey by representatives of the shipping company and the insurance agent.Based on the survey report , they will lodge a clam for compensation . __eou__ If you act as our representative what would you do to safeguard our interest ? __eou__ I think , first of all , I would ask the consignee to produce survey report on loading , if they can't produce that I would suggest them to refer the case to their shipper . Meanwhile , bad weather could be agood excuse to refuse the responsibility . __eou__ Are you able to operate the telex ? __eou__ Yes , I used to dispatch telex to shippers and the consignee to inform them of changes of our schedule and other information . __eou__ Now can you tell me if you have a good command of both written and spoken English ? __eou__ When I was college , I passed Band Six of College English Test.All the foreign business men I've dealt with say my English is quite good . __eou__ If you are selected for the position , you must prepare to travel overseas frequently . __eou__ No problem , I love it.Thank you for granting me the interview . __eou__
Have you seen this news article ? Apparently an organization has made a list to name the new seven wonders of the world and people could vote for them online . __eou__ Wow , that's really interesting . So who won ? __eou__ Well , the Great Wall of China , the Taj Mahal in India . __eou__ I've been there ! It really is an amazing work of architecture and art . The entire complex is made of white marble and in the interior of the tomb , the walls are covered with gems and emeralds ! __eou__ Cool ! Also amongst the winners is Petra , in Jordan , Mach Pitch in Peru and the pyramid in Chichenitza in Mexico . __eou__ Wait a minute ! It also says that the Christ Re-deemer statue in Brazil and the Colosseum in Rome are wonders . I would love to go to Italy and see the Colosseum , stand in the middle like a gladiator ! __eou__ Well , let's see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the year . __eou__ Good idea ! __eou__
It's amazing to me how international business has become . Take my store for example . On any given day , you will find imported items from more than 20 different countries on our shelves . __eou__ How many different varieties of products do you import from China ? __eou__ China provides the bulk of our product inventory , for sure . We import more than 40 different items from China . Most of the imports that come out of China are low-grade plastics or toys . Japan produces many electronic exports , Germany produces excellent mechanical exports . __eou__ Do you import any food items ? __eou__ Generally speaking , food items are difficult to import . Food with the short shelf life is liable to spoil in the time it takes to ship from one place to another . The only food items we import are specialty canned or preserved foods . The shelf life is longer for these products . __eou__
Do you know who Ammo Hung is ? __eou__ Of course . He is now 50 years old . And he started out studying alembics , singing , dancing and martial arts at the age of nine , and has tarred in 140 kung fu films .

Very good . Now , I have a couple of final questions . __eou__ I hope they ’ re not too hard ! __eou__ Well , why should we hire you ? __eou__ I think that I would be a perfect fit in this company . I have a unique combination of strong technical acumen , and outstanding soft skills . you know , I excel at building strong , long-term customer relationships . For example , when I headed the customer support department in my previous company , our team solved about seventy percent of our customers ’ problems . I decided that we needed better information and technical preparation on our products , so after I implemented a series of training sessions in coordination with our technical department , we were able to solve ninety percent of our customers ’ issues . Given the opportunity , I could bring this kind of success to this company . __eou__ Impressive ! So , what would you consider to be your greatest weakness ? __eou__ I struggle with organization and time management . Punctuality has never been a strength of mine .

China is now a member of world trade organization . As a member of TO , China will have to make some changes in its economic policies so that it can follow the routines practiced by other TO members . Is it fair to China , do you think ? __eou__ It's a hard question , but I'm sure the reexamination of China's economic policies in the past may lead us to a right answer to the question . After the establishment of new China , our government employed numerous economics policies to stimulate the growth of China's economy . These policies , however , favored our domestic enterprises and protected them from international competition and these policies have contributed a lot to the rapid growth of both China economy and our domestic enterprises . After China's entry into TO , Chinese domestic enterprises will have to compete with their foreign counterparts . This new situation entails some changes of Chinese economic policies . These changes will spur Chinese enterprises to strengthen their competitiveness in the long run . __eou__ We can infer that the non-discrimination principle is one of the most important principles of TO agreement . This principle requires equal treatment of domestic and foreign enterprise . Does the principle also apply to domestic enterprise of different ownerships ? __eou__ Yes , it does . Domestic enterprises of different ownerships enjoy equal rights for the non-discrimination principle grants equal rights to enterprises , regardless of their nationality and ownership . I have found that although changes of China's economic policies are numerous , these changes are largely based on the most important economic principle ot TO agreement-non-discrimination principle . Such an understanding of principle of the changes may help us not only to have a good insight into the changes but also to foresee the tendency of the new changes of China's economic policies . __eou__
Why do all girls appear feminine after sophomore year ? __eou__ Because they are full-grown . Look at their curvy figures . __eou__ I feel they all talk and behave in a different way . __eou__ They suddenly become shy when they speak to boys . __eou__ Some even do make-up slightly . Are you aware that previous ' small potato ' Ma Xiaoxiao becomes a piece of cheese cake recently ? __eou__ She is certainly not my kind of girl . __eou__ Stop preaching your dream love Marilyn Monroe to me . I know those sexy women are your tastes . __eou__ You are so Platonic . Those naive girls will eventually grow into real women . They can't resist love , and men cannot resist their attraction either . __eou__ I appreciate the saying ' Love consists in this , that two solitude protect , border and salute each other . ' __eou__
Excuse me Miao Li . Could you tell me who Jackie Chan is ? __eou__ Certainly . Jackie Chan is a very famous movie star in Hong Kong . His Chinese name is Cheng Long . __eou__ Ha , I know Cheng Long a lot , he has made 40 films since 1976 . And at that time he was promoted as the new Bruce Lee . But I'm not familiar with his English name . __eou__ OK . Then tell me what else you know . __eou__ Some movie stars measure their worth by how many millions of dollars they make . Do you know how Jackie Chan measures his worth ? __eou__ He measures his worth by how many of his bones he has fractured while executing his film , incredible stunts . By the way , can you count the breaks ? __eou__ Sure . His skull , his eyes , his nose , three times , his jaw , his shoul-der , is chest , two fingers , a knee . As he said ' Everything from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet ! ' __eou__ Indeed you know much about him . __eou__ This is because he is the action-movie incarnate or action-star extraordinaire around the world . __eou__
Television is undoubtedly a great invention , but one of the main criticisms of it is that people just aren't selective enough . Lesley , got a television . how do you pick out the sorts ofprogrammes you want to watch ? __eou__ I try and look at the programmes that are on to decide which particular ones interest me , rather than you turning it on a seven o'clock and you leaving it on until half-past eleven when the programmes finish . __eou__ Do you think of television though as a great time-waster ? __eou__ Un ... I think it can be a time-waster and it depends on how particular people are about what they want to see ... Mm , it can just be a sort total amusement for someone and totally consuming without reallyconsidering what it is they're watching . __eou__ Aha , but how do you prevent it coming into your life and taking oversour evenings and at the same time perhaps get . . . get out of thetelevision some of the sort of best things ... best programmes that ... that undoubtedly are on television ? __eou__ Well , I suppose one of the problems is ... will depend on what a person's life style is , and that if he has other outside interests which are equally important to him as television , he will then , you know , hmm . be more careful about which programme she wants to watch because he has time which he wants to use for other things . __eou__ Do you think though that ... that in . . . in a sense television skilled people's own er ... sort of , creativity or their ability entertain themselves because if they're bored all they do is justturn on the television ? __eou__ Yes , I think that is a danger , and I think that . . in fact is what mishappening to a lot of people who use it as their ... their main ... um field of amusement and ... because they don't have other outside interests and even when people come round they'll leave the television and not be , you know , particularly interested in talking to them , you Know the television will be the main thing in the room . __eou__
Millions of amateur investors like you , have to rely on a dizzying array of financial newspapers , magazines and commentators to get investment information . __eou__ Yes.It ' s sometimes scary if you think of the tremendous amount of media we face every day . __eou__ It's like information overload , not to mention the reliability of these papers and magazines . __eou__ Which financial magazines and newspapers do you think do the best job of checking facts ? __eou__ Well , for example , The Wall Street Journal is very , very good . Even though it's used on occasion ( as all news organizations are ) by Ces or bankers who leak their mergers in advance in order to get a positive spin . __eou__ I like to read Fortune . __eou__ Good . Fortune is usually ahead of the curve.And Business Week is very solid , too . __eou__ Where does a broadcast company get most of their information ? I hope it's not just from press releases . __eou__ A good broadcast company usually does far more than press releases.Their people go out and do real reporting , talking to people at the stock exchange , fund managers , analysts , etc . __eou__ But sometimes when a flimsy report , or even a rumor gets on television , there's going to be a terrible ' echo chamber ' effect . __eou__ You are right about that . __eou__
I wish our competition will quit poaching our people , when Susan resigned last week to work for the Sunburst , she was our fourth employee to leave us for them . __eou__ Have you ever considered that perhaps we have a morale problem among our employees ? If everyone is discontent with their work , of course they won't stick arround . __eou__ Well , those do leave will soon find out the grass isn't as green on the other side of sense as they thought it was , I know Sunburst is suffering from inbreeding . __eou__ Inbreeding is a big drawback from snitching most of their employers from one or two companies . __eou__ With Susan leaving , we should probably look to someone new on board . __eou__ Our human resource department is working on it , it's not easy to recruit new employees every few month , it's hard to find qualified people . __eou__ Maybe we should start shopping around the competitors people . __eou__
The demographic reports are in ... From the looks of it , we're going to have to re-evaluate some of the content for our promotional events in different venues . __eou__ Why , what's the lowdown ? __eou__ According to the report , our Boston crowd is quite different make-up from our Chicago folks . Our Boston consumers are mostly from mid-level to upper-class income levels , university or postgraduates , married no children , white collar ... You know the kind . Chicago on the other hand is mostly mid to low income levels , single parent homes , blue collar ... I think we're talking about two totally different target groups . __eou__ I have no idea there was that great of deviation between the two venues ... To make our products sell , we have to take the target audience into account . __eou__ No kidding . We've got to come up with two completely different sales pitches to suit the needs of each groups . __eou__
Miss , may I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I just wondered why the price between the ninth and tenth floor is so different . __eou__ It's because of the view . __eou__ Oh ! I see . Can you show me the location of Block I ? __eou__ Sure . Please take a look at the model of the building . Nice Garden has a total of two blocks which are labeled Block I and Block II . Block I has a total of thirty-eighth floors . The thirty-seventh and thirty-eighth are penthouses . There are four units in one floor . The sizes of the units are one thousand square feet and one thousand and five hundred square feet . The size with one thousand square feet has three bedrooms and the biggest size has four bedrooms . __eou__ How many elevators are there ? __eou__ There are three elevators between one hundred and forty-eight units . __eou__ How about the car-park space ? __eou__ There are a total of one hundred and sixty parking spaces on the second and third floor , in which twelve are for visitors and the rest are for residents . __eou__ Any other facilities ? __eou__ Sure , on the fourth floor is a recreation quarter . There are two swimming pools . One is Olympic standard size and the other one is for children . Also , there is a gymnasium for resident members only . __eou__ What is the completion date ? __eou__ The completion date will be July 1st 2007 . __eou__ How about the price and the bank mortgage ? __eou__ Please check up the price list . The average unit price is five million Hong Kong dollars . There are eight different banks that will provide a seventy percent mortgage loan . Also , the developer will offer another ten percent mortgage to purchasers . __eou__ How many payment methods are there ? __eou__ It's all written on the brochure price list . I believe there will be one right for you . Please hurry up because almost half of units have already gone . __eou__ Thank you . I think I have to talk to the bank representatives . Thank you for your help . __eou__ You're welcome . __eou__
Could you tell me something about investment environment of your country ? __eou__ Our country is a free trade nation . She was mainly agriculture and rather a backward country and mow has developed into a modern highly industrialized state with an expanding economy . Parallel to this , her dependence upon foreign trade has increased . Increased output generates a greater need for raw materials , semi-finished products and capital goods . Thus . in many fields , our country is an important and growing market for exporters from other countries . But this doesn't mean that our country is an easy market , because of a liberal import policy and the high standard in our market is keen . __eou__ Well , what about price ? __eou__ The price factor can be a useful instrument for exporters when trying to place their products in industrialized countries . Of course , marketing goods abroad is not only a question of price . There are also other important factors such as design , quality of goods , terms of sale , transport and insurance . __eou__
God , I didn ’ t realize . I didn ’ t , I didn ’ t know ... __eou__ ... Who you were with ? I didn ’ t know whom you were with . __eou__ Excuse me ? __eou__ Sorry , it ’ s from the Godfather . It ’ s when the , when the movie producer realizes Tom Higgins had emissary of Vito Corleone , it ’ s just before the horse ’ s head ends up in the bed with all the bloody sheets , you know , wakes up , and AAAL ! Never mind . __eou__ You were spying on me , weren ’ t you ? You probably rented those children . __eou__ Why would I spy on you ? __eou__ Because I am your competition which you know perfectly well , or you would not put up that sign just around the corner . __eou__ The entrance to our store is around the corner . And there ’ s no other way of saying that . It ’ s not the name of our store . It ’ s where it is . And you do not own the phrase around the corner . __eou__ What is that ? What are you doing ? You ’ re taking all the caviar ! That caviar is a garnish ? __eou__ Look , the reason I came into your store is because I was spending the day with Annabell and matt . And I was buying them presents . I ’ m the type of guy who likes to buy his way into the hearts of children who are his relative . And there ’ s only one place to find a children ’ s book in the neighborhood . That will not always be the case . And it was yours . And it is a charming little bookstore . You probably sell what 350,000 worth of books in a year . __eou__
Mrs . Miller , you are an old friend of ours . In order to encourage future business and as a gesture of friendship , we are prepared to cut our price by 5 % . Will that satisfy you ? __eou__ That's great . Thank you for making this concession . I accept . __eou__ Now I repeat , 5,000 transistor sets , specifications as shown in our catalogue at $ 20 each C . I . F . Los Angeles . __eou__ Good . Now that the price is decided on , we can discuss the packaging . __eou__ As to packaging , we'll pack them two dozens to one carton , gross weight about 25 kilos a carton . __eou__ Carton ? __eou__ Yes , corrugated cardboard boxes . __eou__ Could you use wooden cases instead ? __eou__ Why use wooden cases ? __eou__ I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for ocean transportation . __eou__ Cartons are comparatively light , and there fore easy to handle . They'll not be stowed away with the heavy cargo . Besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with metal straps . __eou__ All right . Carton or no carton , the packaging must be waterproof as well as strong enough to stand shock and rough handling . __eou__ You needn't worry about that . Cartons are extensively used in our shipments to foreign countries and there have never been complaints from our clients . Now , as regards payment , we have agreed to use dollars , am I right ? __eou__ That's right . As soon as I get home , I'll see about the opening of the letter of credit . __eou__ Please open the letter of credit 15 to 30 days before the date of delivery so that we'll have enough time to make all the necessary arrangements . Another thing , the L / C should be valid until the 15th day after shipment . __eou__ No problem . That can be done . I understand you'll ship the goods before the end of May ? __eou__ Right . We'll ship the goods according to the agreed time schedule . Last , but not least , the inspection is to be carried out by Houston Commodities Inspection Bureau , which is final and binding on both parties . __eou__ Yes , we agreed to that . We have great confidence in your inspection institution . Through years of dealing with you , we've convinced of your commercial integrity . __eou__ Thank you . You can rest assured that we'll do everything possible to prevent de festive commodities from going abroad . However , if there should be any disputes , we wish to have them settled through friendly discussions . __eou__ Exactly . That's what we have done in the past . __eou__ Well , it seems we have covered everything . We'll have the contract ready in a couple of days . __eou__ Can you speed it up and let me have it today ? I'm leaving tomorrow . I've been here for almost a month now , you see . My corporation is urging me to return . I've booked the ticket for tomorrow afternoon's flight at 3 . __eou__ Let me see . If we can't get the contract ready by then , we'll send it to you by airmail for your signature . __eou__ That's fine too . __eou__
Mr . Jones , shall we now discuss the packaging ? __eou__ Very well . You know , we have definite ways of packaging garments . As to blouses , we use a polythene wrapper for each article , all ready for window display . __eou__ Good . A wrapping that catches the eye will certainly help push the sales . With competition from similar garments producers , the merchandise must not only be good value but also look attractive . __eou__ Right you are . We'll see to it that the blouses appeal to the eye as well as to the purse . __eou__ What about the outer packing ? __eou__ We'll pack them 10 dozens to one carton , gross weight around 25 kilos a carton . __eou__ Cartons ? __eou__ Yes , corrugated cardboard boxes . __eou__ Could you use wooden cases instead ? __eou__ Why use wooden cases ? __eou__ I'm afraid the cardboard boxes are not strong enough for such a heavy load . __eou__ The cartons are comparatively light , and therefore easy to handle . They won't be stowed away with the heavy cargo . The stevedores will see to that . Besides , we'll reinforce the cartons with straps . Silk blouses are not fragile goods . They can stand a lot of jolting . __eou__ Maybe you are right , but the goods are to be transhipped at Hamburg or London . If the boxes are moved about on an open wharf , the dampness or rain may get into them . This would make the blouses spotted or ruined . __eou__ No need to worry about that . The cartons lined with plastic sheets are waterproof , and as the boxes are made of cardboard , they will be handled with care . __eou__ Well , I don't want to take any chances . Besides , cartons are easy to cut open , and this increases the risk of pilferage . __eou__ Tampering with cartons is easily detected . I should say that this rather discourages pilferage . __eou__ Maybe so , but I'm afraid that in case of damage or pilferage , the insurance company will refuse compensation on the ground of improper packing , or packing unsuitable for sea voyage . __eou__ But cartons are quite seaworthy . They are extensively used in our shipments to continental ports . There are never any complaints from our clients , and our insurance company has also approved such packing for W . P . A . and T . P . N . D . __eou__ If you could guarantee compensation in case the insurance com - any refuses to honor a claim for faulty packing , we would be quite willing to accept cartons . __eou__ I'm sorry , but we can't take on any responsibility that is beyond our functions and powers . We'll make sure that the packing is seaworthy , but we can't commit ourselves to being responsible for every kind of mishap . __eou__ I can understand your position . Perhaps I'm asking too much . __eou__ We'll use wooden cases if you insist , but the charge for packing will be considerably higher , and it also slows delivery . __eou__ Well , I'll call you immediately for instructions on the matter . __eou__ Please do . I'll be waiting for your reply . __eou__
At the Beijing Olympics , all four table tennis events were all-Chinese finals . A clean sweep again ! __eou__ Yes . All international ping-pong tournaments have become a demonstration of Chinese supremacy in the sport . __eou__ Do you know any secrets to China's success ? __eou__ In the first place , I think the whole nation is just fond of the game . It is well grounded with the mass . With huge numbers of people playing ping-pong , we can always spot a handful of potential world champions . __eou__ So , the national ping-pong team must be a highly competitive membership . __eou__ Sure . There is a careful mechanism for selecting players from provincial teams , and those lucky dogs have to observe strict rules . __eou__ For example ? __eou__ They are subject to hard training . And you know what , for a player on the national team , personal affairs are supposed to take a back seat to training and competitions . They are not even allowed to talk relationships with each other . __eou__ Oh , dear ! It's an encroachment on individual rights ! __eou__ Well , ping-pong is our national sport , and we just have to keep winning one honor after another . That's why many people think such rules acceptable . After all , they are funded out of taxpayers'money . __eou__
What ’ s the difference between football and rugby ? __eou__ Those tow games are quite different . First , there ’ s the size of the teams . In football , a team has 11 players . In rugby there are 15 players on each team . The biggest difference is that in football , only the goalkeeper can use his hands . In rugby , the ball is usually carried forward by players , though kicking is permitted . __eou__ In rugby , players pass the ball by throwing it to team mates , don ’ t they ? __eou__ That ’ s right . However , players can only pass the ball backwards . They cannot pass the ball forwards to their team mates . That ’ s a foul . __eou__ I know how goals are scored in football , but how about in rugby ? __eou__ If a team carries the ball over the goal line , they score points . A team can also score points by kicking the ball between two tall posts at each end of the pitch . __eou__ There ’ s a lot more physical contact in rugby , isn ’ t there ? __eou__ Yes . Players usually need to bring a player down to stop him from moving forward with the ball . This is called ” tackling ” , as in football . __eou__ The ball is a different shape in rugby , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Yes . It ’ s not perfectly round like a football . A rugby ball is oval in shape . There ’ s a match on TV this afternoon . Why don ’ t you watch it with me ? I ’ ll try to explain the rules and tactics while we ’ re watching . __eou__ Ok . __eou__
Ok . Let ’ s look at our short presentation on China . What do we need to include ? __eou__ We need to talk about the size of the country and its population . __eou__ Ok . China is about the same size as Canada and the united states and it has a population of about 1.3 billion , making it the latest country in the world by population . __eou__ It says here that most of the people are han Chinese , but there are 55 minorities that make up almost 10 % of the population . __eou__ We need to say something about the geography and climate of china . Is there any way to divide the country into sections ? __eou__ We could divide into five parts . There ’ s the northeast , which is mild in summer and very cold in winter . Then there is the northwest , which is largely desert . Tillet is famous for its mountainous climate . The rest of the country can be roughly divided into two parts . One is temperate-mild in winter and warm in summer . Then , in the south it is hot most of the year . __eou__ That sounds very general . __eou__ It is , buy remember that we only have a few minutes to make our presentation . We can select cities from each part and give data for each one . __eou__ One from each part ? Lhasa , Urumqi , Harbin , shanghai , and hongkong . The capital city is Beijing , right ? __eou__ Yes . The other large cities are Chengdu , Dalian , Wuhan , tianjin , shenyang , Chongqing . Hongkong and Guangzhou . __eou__ We should take a large map and highlight those cities . What is each of them famous for ? __eou__
Jane ! What an enchanting skirt you have on ! __eou__ Thank you ! Guess how much it costs . __eou__ Bright colors , smooth material , exquisite craftsmanship , soft lines ... Darling , it looks elegant on you ! It can't be any cheap stuff . Something around two hundred , I guess . __eou__ Your offer is way off the mark . It set me back only sixty-five . __eou__ Then you got a windfall ! Was sixty-five the original price , or did you get a special discount ? __eou__ Neither . I drove a hard bargain with the vendor before I got the price down . __eou__ How much did she ask for ? __eou__ Three hundred ! That's daylight robbery . How dare she play tricks on an old hand like me ? Without hesitation , I gave my offer---no more than fifty . __eou__ She must be fuming with anger at such a bid , wasn't she ? __eou__ Not at all ! She's really been around , and seemed quite accustomed to bargaining like this . That's the trade . She only demanded a higher bid , saying the purchase price was even higher than seventy . She was lying ! Then I inquired , ' May I have it at sixty ? ' she waved her head . __eou__ Then you pretended to go without buying it ? __eou__ Yeah . I turned around and started to move out . Just then , she yelped behind my back , ' all right , all right ! I may sacrifice a little . Let's fix it sixty-five ! Can't be cheaper . ' __eou__
The new webpage design is much more effective than before . I feel confident it will rope in a lot more business because of its user-friendly format . __eou__ Why do you think the new page is so much better than the old page ? I thought the old page wasn't half bad ... __eou__ The old page was okay , alright , but there wasn't a big influence in our sales volume , because the site wasn't developed with an eye towards the marketing aspect . Now it's different . We got our marketing department team in on the action , and the results are smashing ... __eou__ What changes were made from the old page to the new page ? __eou__ First , the visitors to the site are encouraged to give their contact information . They can sign up for a free monthly drawing . Once we've got their info , it goes into a database for future marketing mailers and advertising targeting . Also , there are clear links to descriptions of our products and services , so as to give confidence to new customers . We also added a specific area for on-line customer service ... So far we've gotten a ton of positive feedback ... __eou__ Great ! __eou__
Is your lady beautiful ? Since I came here from the country , I've not seen her close . Tell me , is she beautiful ? __eou__ Thomas , if I could write with the beauty in her eyes , I was born to look in them and know myself . __eou__ And , her lips ? __eou__ Her lips ? The early morning rose would wither on the branch if it could feel envy . __eou__ And her voice like a lark's song ? __eou__ Deeper , softer , none of your twittering larks . I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupted her song . __eou__ Oh , she sings too ? __eou__ Constantly . Without doubt , and plays the lute . She has a natural ear . __eou__
I often see some ' new age people ' show off their various skills to handle a skateboard , which makes me wonder in awe . __eou__ Annie , you also know the ' new age people ' . I think these people must have undergone much sufferings of flesh in order to ride skillfully . __eou__ Although it is easy to ride , the condition of the road surface should also be paid attention to , such as places being put together and full of gullies . If the condition permits , it is better to be equipped with helmet , eye shades , ankle shield , knee shield and elbow shield . __eou__ The skateboard does not pollute the air , either . It can be used as a tool to ride instead of walk . __eou__

The price of residential properly has risen almost twenty percent . __eou__ Really ?

Johnson , I would like to remind you my company will charge a commission equivalent to one percent of the transaction price in the event of a successful selling of the property through our introduction . __eou__ No problem . __eou__ Thank you very much . I will introduce your property to our clients . When they want to see your property , I will give you a call . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
During the last two years , there has been a great increase in goods stolen abroad . __eou__ If they steal the entire package , that would be theft . So they don't do that . Generally , thieves open the case and take part of the contents out . Then fill the case so that the gross weight will be the same . __eou__ If the goods are received in apparent good order and condition , the steamship company doesn ’ t have liability for pilferage . How do we protect ourselves ? __eou__ The insurance policy protects us . __eou__ Is it true that products of high value such as watches , jewels and luxury clothing items are often subject to pilferage ? __eou__ It's absolutely true in the United States that losses from pilferage have been limited to high valued goods . We must study more about packing . __eou__
Hi , Ann . I was wondering if you are free tomorrow night ? __eou__ Well , George . I guess I am . Why do you ask ? __eou__ I've just gotten a pair of pre-sale Star Wars movie tickets from a friend and was thinking of inviting you along for the opening premiere . Are you interested ? __eou__ Yeah , definitely ! Thanks for inviting me . __eou__ My pleasure . __eou__ I really wanted to watch the Star Wars on the opening day , but the pre-sale tickets were sold out . How did you manage to get hold of them ? __eou__ A friend of mine works at the corporate headquarters of Pepsi , which is a major sponsor of the movie . He was able to get the tickets for free , and then he sold two more for me for 50 dollars a piece . __eou__ You paid 50 dollars for each ticket ? That's a huge premium over the regular price . __eou__ Not really . Considering the fact that other people were willing to pay as much as 200 dollars each on the black market . Besides , I knew you were really looking forward to watching Star Wars on the opening day . __eou__ Wow ! I am really honored you went through all this trouble just for my sake . I really appreciate that . So , what time are we going ? __eou__ Well , let's see . The movie stars at 10 . We should be there at least 1 hour earlier , because there is a big line . I could pick you up at your house at 8 , if that's ok with you . __eou__ 8 pm , that's fine with me . __eou__ Okay . __eou__ So I'll see you tomorrow then at 8 . __eou__ Yeah , that's great . I'll see you tomorrow night . __eou__ Ok , George . Bye ! __eou__ Bye , Ann ! __eou__
Welcome , sir . May I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I wanna go to America for my vacation . __eou__ No problem . Actually , we have some great packages . The most exciting season of Hawaii is now . How about a relaxing vacation in Hawaii ? __eou__ Sounds good . Are there any group tours I can go with ? __eou__ Yes . There will be one at the end of this month . For many people , a Hawaiian vacation promises languid days filled with sunbathing and poolside cocktails . For others , it ’ s all about non-stop action in one of the world's most extreme natural playgrounds . Whether you are in search of quiet relaxation or unbridled stimulation , Hawaii gives you the best of both . __eou__ Great . So how long is the trip ? __eou__ 15 days . The transportation by air will take five days . __eou__ Fine . I happen to have 20 days for holiday , so exciting ! How many places will be visited and what are they ? Where will be staying and how about the food there ? __eou__ Sir , let's do it step by step . First , we will visit over 25 different places . Most of the places are in Hawaii ’ s Big Island . We will stay in Arlott ’ s Lodge __eou__ Well , cool . What's the price for this trip ? __eou__ Well , right now there's a special rate for 40,000 RIB for this package , including everything such as airline ticket , tour guides , hotels and food . All you have to do is to sign up and we will take care of everything . __eou__ Well . 40,000 RIB that's really a lot of money . I will have to think about it . __eou__ Sure . By the way , this special price is only good through the end of the week . __eou__ Is it Thursday ? I mean if I let the chance slide ... __eou__ Yes , sir . It will be a great pity ! __eou__ Well . Ok , I will take it . __eou__ Thank you ! __eou__
We've settled price , order , payment , now I am calling to ask about package . How can we pack the goods ? __eou__ As a rule , we use cardboard boxes for outer packing . Besides , I would like to make it clear that each piece of computer will be dismantled into several parts before shipment . __eou__ Do you mean that we are responsible for putting them together ? __eou__ Yes . As you know , that's the common practice for exporting computer . This can avoid some damages on computers in the process of transportation . __eou__ I see . Why not use wooden cases ? __eou__ If you prefer wooden cases , we will provide them . But cardboard boxes are light , less expensive , and more convenient to handle in the course of packing and unpacking . __eou__ Oh , I know . Does it mean that shipment will have to be delayed if I insist on using wooden cases ? __eou__ Perhaps . That will be more complicated , if we use wooden boxes . __eou__ Then you may use cardboard boxes for outer packing so long as you can guarantee the safety of the computers . __eou__ That is guaranteed . Each box is lined with foam plastic in order to prevent damage by air , water or stress . Besides , cardboard boxes will be secured together on wood pallets by overall metal strapping . __eou__ Sounds good . __eou__
And how would you describe yourself , Miss Tao ? What kind of person are you ? __eou__ Well , as I mentioned before , I think I am easy-going . I enjoy working and talking with people and I'm a responsible person . __eou__ Did you have any difficulty getting along with fellow students or teachers ? __eou__ No . Not at all . I'm quite easy-going . __eou__ What's your strong points ? __eou__ Oh , I'm very responsible , I can make fast decisions , and I do not need much supervision . I enjoy completing challenging tasks . __eou__ What do you dislike most about your job ? __eou__ Probably routine , dull work . Oh , I am much more enthusiastic if I'm given a challenge and responsibility . __eou__ What kind of relationship do you think should exist between a supervisor and employee ? __eou__ A friendly one . I think an open , friendly , honest relationship should exist . An employee should feel she ( he ) can go to her ( his ) boss anytime with any kind of question . __eou__ Sometimes working with a foreign company can be stressful . Foreigners tend to get excited or angry easily , and they show it . Are you sure you can handle this stress ? How do you deal with conflict in your present job ? __eou__ Well , there's a lot of stress in a Chinese company also , although much of it is below the surface . I have confidence in my ability to handle conflict . If I have a problem with a co-worker , I do everything I can to work it out directly with that person . If I am unable to work it out , then I ask a supervisor to help out . If my boss shouts at me , I try not to take it personally . I try my best to understand the stress he is under . It's kind of like being in a family . Often family members say things in the heat of the moment , but don't mean what they say . A company is like a family , it has good times and bad times . __eou__ How do you feel about overtime work ? __eou__ That's no problem . I know that every company has busy periods . When this happens , I'm ready to put in as much time as necessary to get the job done . __eou__ What is most important to you in a job ? __eou__ I want to feel that I am making a real contribution to the company , so I would like my boss to trust me with important work . __eou__ Do you think that you are introverted or extroverted ? __eou__ I'm quite outspoken . I enjoy calling a spade a spade and hate talking in a roundabout way . So I'd call myself outgoing . __eou__ Under what kind of circumstance will you lose your temper ? __eou__ Seldom . But I hate someone's frequently being late or lazy . __eou__ OK . What are your strong points ? __eou__ Hmm . as I mentioned , I can work well under pressure and I enjoy work that challenges me . I think that my English ability is also a strong point . __eou__ And your weaknesses ? __eou__ I think I sometimes try to be over-organized . So I am learning how to let some things go and concentrate on the most important part of my job . __eou__
Janice , do you still remember how our filing system works ? __eou__ Yes , I have read the Filling Instruction carefully , since you showed me it last week . __eou__ Very good . What is the essence of filing , do you know ? __eou__ The essence of filing I remember is to bring together in a single folder or file all papers relating to a particular subject . And outgoing and incoming letters are kept in this file cabinet . __eou__ Yes , ' One customer--one file ' is essential . And remember to update them timely . __eou__ And each file should be named clearly , either in block capitals or in jet black typed capitals . __eou__ Correct . __eou__ A card index is very important in the filing system . It is a most helpful friend to a secretary , so it must be kept handy and up to date . __eou__ Yes , prompt and careful filing contributes greatly to the efficiency of our office . __eou__
Did you enjoy your weekend at the highland hotel ? I heard it ’ s and excellent place to stay and has good facilities . __eou__ I had a wonderful time . The rooms are not very big , but they are well furnished . The restaurant is excellent and reasonably priced . There ’ s a sauna and a Jacuzzi . __eou__ Do they have a swimming pool ? __eou__ No , they don ’ t . they have a beauty parlor , but I didn ’ t go there . __eou__ What ’ s the service like ? __eou__ It ’ s very good . Check in and check out at the reception only took a few minutes . The wait staff is very good . A waiter recommended their baked fish , which tasted wonderful . The hotel was quite full , so I ’ d suggest making a reservation if you intend to go there . The hotel offers a discount at the weekends . __eou__ It sounds perfect . Did you have any complaints at all ? __eou__ There was a problem with the internet access , so I couldn ’ t check my email , but I didn ’ t complain about it to the management . __eou__ I suppose you were happy to forget about the outside world . __eou__ Yes , I was . Here ’ s their business card . __eou__ Thanks . Was there a mina bar in the room ? __eou__ No , there wasn ’ t . There is a bar on the ground floor and of course you can buy drinks in the restaurant to go with your meal . __eou__ One of the things I dislike about hotels is that everyone expects tips . __eou__ I know . At the inland hotel , they have an interesting policy . When you check out , you put some money in a special box at reception . Each evening , the money in the box is shared equally by the hotel staff . __eou__
Melanie , can you help me with something ? We need to finalize the account with the Mexican Embassy and , I need some advice on phrasing this letter correctly in English . __eou__ Sure Tracy , let me just get my laptop . __eou__ Okay , so ... To Whom It May Concern , I am writing . __eou__ Um , Tracy ? I think that ' s a little too formal . I know you want to be polite but you've already made contact with them , so in English you can be more relaxed in the opening ... __eou__ Okay , more relaxed . Got it . Hey , Sally , what ' s up ? It's Tracy here , just . __eou__ Okay Tracy , now it's too relaxed ! You've still got to show some respect . How about starting with " Dear Ms . Cooper , I'm writing to confirm ... ? __eou__ Great , okay . " Dear Miss Cooper , I'm writing to confirm the final quotation for the full page back cover color advertisement you requested for the spring issue of Voila magazine " . __eou__ That's great ... __eou__ " The final costing , including advert design and production , comes to forty-five thousand six hundred RIB . We want payment ten working days before publication or we will cancel the ad . Thanks for ... " __eou__ Woo , okay , back up a second , Tracy . That's too direct . Can I suggest you say , please note that final payment is due two working weeks before publication ? You don't want to offend her . __eou__ Oops , okay . You are right . Then I can just end with " All the best , Tracy " . __eou__ Mmmm , maybe , but I'd play it safe and just finish with " Yours Sincerely " . That's more professional . __eou__ Oh , Melanie , you are a life saver , thank you ! __eou__
Come in , please . __eou__ Good morning , Mrs Smith . __eou__ Good morning . You are Mr . Sun , aren't you ? Take a seat , please . __eou__ Yes , thank you . __eou__ I've noticed from your resume that you majored in accounting at Peking University . Will you please tell me something about your related courses ? __eou__ In the first academic year we learned Principles of Accounting , and in the following years we learned Cost Accounting , Commercial Accounting , Industrial Accounting , and Management Accounting . __eou__ Have you taken Accounting for Decision-Making and Control ? __eou__ No , we haven't taken such a course , but we have taken a more specialized course for decision making , by the name of Forecasting and Decision-Making . __eou__ From your school report card , I can see you did well in every course . But our advertisement says we need an accountant with practical work experience . __eou__ I forgot to include my experience as an accountant in my resume . In fact , I took a part-time job as an accountant at the Atlantic Trading Company during my second and third school year . I worked three evenings a week there and I did quite well . Here is the recommendation . __eou__ You can speak English fluently but I wonder if you can deal with bookkeeping and accounting in English . __eou__ No problem . The professional English course is just English for Accounting . Moreover , as you know , the Atlantic Trading Company is a Sino-Australian joint venture . When I served part-time there , I became well acquainted with accounting operated in English . __eou__ That sounds fine . Why did you choose to apply to our company ? __eou__ I have a relative working as a manager in your manufacturing department . Her name is Lilling . She told me a lot about your company and I became quite interested . I believe I can have a promising career with the development of this company . __eou__ Do you know something about the payment we give to our employees ? __eou__ No , can you tell me about it ? __eou__ Of course . As for an entry-level accountant , we pay ¥ 1,500 a month in the first half year . We have a grading system to evaluate your work . If you have made progress , we will certainly raise your salary . For beginners with a CPA certificate , they can earn at least ¥ 2 , 000 a month . __eou__ I have passed the five courses required by the Chinese CPA Association , but the certificate won't come to hand until next month . How about that ? __eou__ I hope you can show me your CPA certificate before we reach a decision by the end of July . __eou__ Thank you , Mrs Smith . It is really a pleasure talking with you . __eou__ The same for me . We'll keep in touch with you . __eou__ Thank you . Good-bye . __eou__
Hey , Susan . Have you got a sec ? I have some questions about my paycheck . __eou__ You bet , Emily . Pull up a chair . __eou__ Well , this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand . First of all , what is this FICA , and SUI Y tax , and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan ? __eou__ OK , let's start from the top of your pay stub . This number here represents your gross pay . __eou__ Then here we have a series of deductions . First off are the federal ones . FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act , or something like that . It's your federal income tax . And then there's Social Security and Medicare , which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work . __eou__ All right , I see . So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now . __eou__ That's right . Below the federal deductions are the state deductions . There's the state income tax , and then this SUI / SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up , but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take . __eou__ Yeah , I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that . So there are two separate income taxes — one at a state level and one at a federal level ? __eou__ That's right . Not all states have an income tax . Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead . __eou__ I see . All right , well I think everything else I can figure out on my own . The deductions for health insurance and my 401 ( K ) are pretty self-explanatory . Thanks for your help , Susan . __eou__ No problem ! All those deductions do add up , and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like . I can understand why you'd want some explanation . __eou__ Yeah , I guess it's the same in the UK , I just never paid much attention . See you later ! __eou__
What's wrong ? __eou__ I have a headache . These past few days I've been living off painkillers . Man , I feel like my head is going to explode . __eou__ You should get acupuncture treatment . My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her . __eou__ The results are too slow . On top of that , just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me . __eou__ They don't just randomly stick you , they find your pressure points . The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment , restoring the body's " chi " . __eou__ But I get scared the moment I see a needle . How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end ? __eou__ The needles are very thin , and as long as the doctor's technique is good , and the patient himself is relaxed , it won't hurt-on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain . Now there are high-tech needles that are micro thin ; they don't hurt at all . However , if you are really scared of acupuncture , scraping or cupping are also options . __eou__ Scraping is too terrifying . When they finish scrapping , your body is all red , as if you were just tortured . Cupping is the same , your body ends up with red circles all over . It looks like someone beat you up . __eou__ This only signifies that the toxins have left the body . Actually , there is only discomfort during the treatment process . Once it's over you feel very comfortable . __eou__ Chinese medicine is strange . The patients are already ill , and then the doctor makes them suffer more . __eou__ This is the only way to get at the problem . Anyway , if you want to relieve the pain , you are just going to have to be tough and do it . __eou__ Forget it . I don't want to inflict any more pain on myself . In a little while I'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap . __eou__
What's the news on our website ? How effective do you think it is from a marketing standpoint ? __eou__ We've been able to survey and track some of the information of our website users through some cookie technology , and it's surprising to see the results . __eou__ What kinds of hits are we getting on our company's website ? __eou__ From the numbers , it seems nearly half of the visitors who stumble onto our page pick up the link not from network browsers or search engines , but from our circular insert . That means our consumers are purposefully and actively seeking information about our products and services through the web format . Based on these findings , I am completely convinced the internet is the marketing power of the future ! __eou__ You really think that many people turn to the internet to find product information.What about the old standbys of word mouth and print media ? __eou__ Well , these mediums are still important ... they aren't a thing of the past ... But I think they might be less important now than in the past . The technology age has arrived ! __eou__
Ms.Dawson , I need you to take a dictation for me . __eou__ Yes , sir ... __eou__ This should go out as an intra-office memorandum to all employees by this afternoon.Are you ready ? __eou__ Yes , sir.Go ahead . __eou__ Attention all staff ... Effective immediately , all office communications are restricted to email correspondence and official memos.The use of Instant Message programs by employees during working hours is strictly prohibited . __eou__ Sir , does this apply to intra-office communications only ? Or will it also restrict external communications ? __eou__ It should apply to all communications , not only in this office between employees , but also any outside communications . __eou__ But sir , many employees use Instant Messaging to communicate with their clients . __eou__ They will just have to change their communication methods . I don't want any - one using Instant Messaging in this office.It wastes too much time ! Now , please continue with the memo.Where were we ? __eou__ This applies to internal and external communications . __eou__ Yes.Any employee who persists in using Instant Messaging will first receive a warning and be placed on probation.At second offense , the employee will face termination.Any questions regarding this new policy may be directed to department heads . __eou__ Is that all ? __eou__ Yes.Please get this memo typed up and distributed to all employees before 4 pm . __eou__
What ’ s “ pi ” ? __eou__ That ’ s the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter , I think . __eou__ I see . What is that ratio exactly ? __eou__ It ’ s approximately 3.14 , but the number continues forever . What ’ s the diameter of your circle ? __eou__ It ’ s 10 centimeters , so the circumference should be 31.4 centimeters . __eou__ Ok . My next problem is to convert 10000 british pounds into us dollars . What ’ s the exchange rate at the moment ? __eou__ According to the newspaper , the exchange rate is 1.85 dollars to the pound . __eou__ That means that 10.000 pounds will buy me 18.500 dollars . __eou__ What ’ s the next question . __eou__ Fractions . What ’ s a quarter and an eighth ? That ’ s three-eights . Easy . The next question is “ what are prime numbers ? ” . __eou__ I can help you there . Those are numbers that cannot be created by multiplying two whole numbers , apart from the number itself and 1 , together . __eou__ So , 1,2 and 3 are prime numbers , but 4 isn ’ t because 2 * 2 = 4 . __eou__ Exactly . Anything else ? __eou__ How many seconds in an hour ? 60 seconds multiplied by 60 minutes equals 3600 seconds altogether . __eou__ You ’ ll be a mathematician one day . __eou__
Terrible . How about people's lives ? __eou__ Fortunately , there is no person died . __eou__ That's great . It seems that Typhoon is not as bad as earthquake . __eou__ Yeah . Earthquake is one of the most badly natural disasters in the world . __eou__ That's why many people died in the earthquake . __eou__ Well , China is located on the Eurasia plate , where earthquakes happen frequently due to the earth's plates knocking against each other . __eou__ Oh , China does have been plagued by numerous destructive earthquakes during its long history . __eou__ Yeah , we've experienced the 8.0 magnitude earthquake in Wenchman . __eou__ We're all familiar with natural disasters . but we still feel weak when we face Wenchman earthquake . __eou__ Right . But people at that time only know two words , " save " and " assistance " , they will never don't lift a finger . Life is the most important compared with anything else . __eou__ That's the point . Love among human beings is not limited by geography . __eou__
So tell me , what's the difference between the Board of Directors , the CEO , and the stockholders ? They all seems ot be the same group of people to me ... __eou__ No , there's a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . Then there's the CEO — the chief executive officer . He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased . __eou__ How many people are on the board of directors ? __eou__ Usually not more than 15 , not less than 10 . They meet monthly , quarterly , or biannually to oversee an organization or company . They provide long term planing and vision , and also act as moral watchdogs rto keep the company in line . __eou__
I wish to make it clear at the outset that this matter of labels is entirely our problem . __eou__ I should say it is something we have never come across before . __eou__ The Federal Food and Drug Administration , or the FDA as we call it for short , imposes a whole set of regulations on the import of food products to the United States . Over the years , they have become so rigid and complicated that they are now quite a head - ache for us importers . __eou__ In my opinion , overly strict regulations are just another way of restricting imports . __eou__ Ah , there's something in what you're saying . According to the present FDA regulations , the Ma Ling Labels then cannot be used if the lichee is to be offered for import into the United States . __eou__ Why not ? Our cannedlichee and canned provisions have already been widely sold in various markets abroad , and the Ma Ling Label has now been accepted by most of overseas customers and importers . Is it quite impossible for you to use the Ma Ling labels as they are ? __eou__ I'd be quite willing to if I could , but we must comply with the label requirements according to our law , or we can't clear the consignment of lichee through the Customs . __eou__ In that case , what can we do to help you ? Have you any suggestions ? __eou__ Would you consider quoting us for the order with neutral cans on a C . I . F . basis for delivery in Hong Kong ? Our associated company there will have the labels printed to comply with the FDA regulations . __eou__ Do you think that's the only way out ? You know we usually do the labeling , as we are responsible for the brand labels of our products . __eou__
Hey . Owen ! Have you gone on your family vacation yet ? __eou__ Oh , yes . I got so tired . My son began to cry the moment we got on the train . It was very embarrassing because we took the over-night train and the noise made it difficult for other people in the cabin to sleep . __eou__ Didn't you bring his favorite toy ? __eou__ Yes , we did . Fortunately we put his Teddy Bear in the bag , and finally he fell asleep at mid-night with it in his arms . __eou__ Where did you go ? You've got a beautiful tan . __eou__ My wife didn't like to go to amusement parks , so we compromised and finally went to the seaside . I think vacation in summer is not good . __eou__ You must have had a great time . Most children love to play in the sand on the beach and go swimming . __eou__ Yes , he was every excited to see the blue sea and picked up many seashells to give as gift for his classmates in kindergarten . __eou__ His friends will be very happy to get the little souvenir . __eou__ And I taught him how to swim in the sea . It was fun and made him braver than before . After we returned home , he wasn't afraid to sleep alone in his bedroom . __eou__
What's your favorite sport ? __eou__ It's hard to say . Perhaps swimming is my favorite . I like swimming because it helps improve my lung capacity . In the scorching summer days , there's nothing like a cool swim . Currently , I go to the pool twice every week . __eou__ Is the entrance charge expensive ? __eou__ Well , it costs an arm and a leg — 30 yuan per person . What a costly sport ! That is why I have to refrain from even thinking about it . And I find jogging a very agreeable substitute . __eou__ Haha , jogging ? Perhaps it might be a bit too boring ? __eou__ You know what ? You won't get a rush from it until you fully understand it . It is a simple sport and doesn't require skills of any sort . This leaves room for me to enjoy the beautiful suburban scenery while jogging . Fresh air caresses my face and blows into my chest , which translates into inspirations . Inspirations are really good stuff for a writer like me . Sometimes , I even come up with a verse or two . __eou__ You are really a man who knows how to enjoy being alone . __eou__
What a nice dress , Jean.You look marvelous ! __eou__ You , too . Where did you get your new hat ? __eou__ From the Crown's . Oh , what lovely earrings you have ! Are they diamond ? __eou__ Yes . It's a birthday present from my husband ! __eou__ Well , you are lucky to have such a considerate husband . Mine hasn't brought me a single rose since we married . __eou__ He'll come out with surprises . Just wait and see . Look at that woman , with the white chiffon ! __eou__ She's chic , isn't she ? __eou__ Yes . I like the dress . It must be the latest fashion . Look , the hem has lowered , and the waist narrowed . __eou__ It makes me feel rather shabby . That woman has a good taste in dressing , I would say . __eou__ Yes . She dressed with an individual flair . I rather envy her . __eou__ Most women follow fashion like sheep.They don't know any better than imitate . __eou__ I quite agree with you.See the woman there ? I dare say she hasn't got any eyes . How could she match the mauve gown with the green handbag ? And all that jewelry ! __eou__ The gown is quite expensive , believe me . __eou__ So what ? It only makes her look cheap and vulgar . __eou__ You know those upstarts . They're all show-offs ! I think I'd better have a diet ; otherwise I'd look like a ballon soon . __eou__ You're quite slim . In fact , if you were one of those starlets , the movie company would say you have a fabulous figure . __eou__ Thanks . I'm flattered . __eou__ Oh , my shoes pinch me . Let's find a seat and sit a while . __eou__
How could you handle living in such a big family ? Does everyone get along ? __eou__ Sure . We love each other and take care of each other . __eou__ In such a big family , there must be a head . Who's the head of your family ? __eou__ My grandpa . He has the final word about almost everything . My grandpa is “ President , ” and Grandma is “ Vice-President . ” My parents , uncles and aunts try to arrive at a consensus on important questions . __eou__ Is a family like yours common in South Korea ? __eou__ No . Not anymore.Mine is highly educated but traditional family . Most South Korea families today are a lot smaller . In traditional families , the old people are well respected and taken good care of . Ho __eou__ My family setup is a bit different . In New York city , there're only three people , my mother , my stepfather and me . During this summertime , I fly out to California and live with my dad . Dad's getting __eou__ Of course there'll be a room for you ! __eou__ To be blunt , maybe I won't be able to get along with his new wife or her kids . __eou__ Yours is a modern family . I'm sure your dad loves you and would want you to stay for the summer . You just need to try your best to get along with your new stepmother and her boys . __eou__ But four boys ! __eou__ It will be a new experience , and you might as well learn to adjust to changes . __eou__ You are right , I guess.The world keeps changing , and so do families . But I like a small-sized or medium-sized family where everybody is equal to everybody else . That's what I want . __eou__ It is good to have goals in life . If California doesn't work out , come and visit me in Korea , OK ? __eou__ That's a great idea ! __eou__ We could share a room ! It would be fun . And we could do some traveling around Korea . You could see for yourself what life in a big family is like ! __eou__ That sounds like an excellent offer . I might take you up on that . Thank you for the wonderful invitation . __eou__
So , now we have covered all the important points . __eou__ Yes , I think so . __eou__ Before we draft the contract , let's examine the details . __eou__ Ok , under this contract , we ’ ll supply you with 600 dozen T-shirts , S , M and L equally assorted , at USD 100 per dozen , CFR London . Shipment in July . Payment by irrevocable sight LC . __eou__ Perfect . But what I ’ m concerned about most is the time of delivery 。 __eou__ You may rest assured that shipment will be effected within the time limits stipulated in the contract . But there is also one point I ’ d like to stress . __eou__ Yes ? __eou__ Your LC must be opened at least onemonth before the time shipment , otherwise we won't be able to catch the ship . __eou__ No problem . I ’ ll have the covering LC opened as soon as I wetback . In addition , would you tell me by whom the commodity inspection is conducted before shipment ? __eou__ The goods will be inspected by the China Import & Export Commodity Inspection Bureau . It will then issue certificate of quality and a certificate of weight . These will be taken as final and biding . __eou__ Please remember to use both English and Chinese versions and both versions should be equally valid . __eou__ Naturally . Each of us keeps one original and two copies . __eou__ Then I ’ ll come along three days later to put my signature on it . __eou__ Good . __eou__
Good morning , Mr . Green . Please have a seat . I received your resume last Monday and I would like to say I ’ m very impressed . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ May I asked why you are interested in working for us ? __eou__ Your company has an impressive reputation . My uncle worked for your company for many years . __eou__ Oh , did he ? __eou__ Yes , but he retired 5 years ago . __eou__ Would you mind telling me a little bit about your present job ? __eou__ I ’ m a senior broker in a large company . I deal with clients on a daily basis , handling all aspects of their accounts personally . __eou__ Do you think you are the right candidate for this position ? __eou__ Yes , I do think I am the right candidate for this position . __eou__ Why do you think you ’ re the right candidate for this position ? __eou__ Well , I have a lot of experience in this area . I have all the qualifications you need . I enjoy working with people . In my current job , I ’ m in charge of a team of eight people . __eou__ Well , you might be the person we ’ Ve been looking for . Do you have any questions ? __eou__ Yes , if I were hired , when would you like me to start ? __eou__ At the end of this month . __eou__ And how many accounts would I handle ? __eou__ You ’ ll be supervising six brokers who manage a combined total of 310 accounts . __eou__ What kind of benefit package do you offer ? __eou__ Two weeks of paid vacation in your first year of employment . You ’ re also eligible for medical and dental insurance . And we offer a generous retirement pension plan after 10 years of service . Do you have any other questions ? __eou__ No , not at the moment . __eou__ Well , I ’ ll have to discuss your application with my colleagues , and we ’ ll get back to you early next week . __eou__ Thanks . It was very nice to meet you . __eou__ It was nice to meet you , too . And thanks for coming in today . __eou__
I need your help , Bob . __eou__ What's the matter ? __eou__ I'm really confused by these annoying abbreviations . __eou__ Just relax . That's because you're new to chat . Let me take a look . __eou__ A / S / L , IGP , H & K , and ZZZ . What the hell do they mean ? __eou__ ZZZ means'sleepy or tired or bored ' , A / S / L is tricky , which is often used at first encounter . It's a three-word question , ' age , / sex / location ? ' __eou__ Interesting . Then what does H & K refer to ? The city of Hong Kong ? __eou__ Wrong . lt's not a place name , but a passionate act . __eou__ Really ? What kind ? A girl left this word to me , and I thought she was in Hong Kong . __eou__ Ahahah ... you miss her point for sure . H & K actually is an acronym for ' hug and kiss ' . __eou__ Hug and kiss ? ! How is it possible ? Oh , it's really bad to Miun - Verstand her meaning . __eou__ Yeah , seems that you have a lot to learn and memorize . __eou__
Do you like climbing ? __eou__ Yes , I like it very much . __eou__ How about climbing up the Fragrant Mountain tomorrow ? __eou__ Where is it ? __eou__ It is located at the east foot of Western Mountain of Beijing , in a park with the same name . There are some huge stones within the mountain which look like the censer , so it is called ' Fragrant Mountain ' . __eou__ Have you visited it before ? __eou__ Many times . Except climbing , there are many attractions worth visiting . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ It is the best season to view red leaves from the Mid-October to the first ten days of November . During the period , thousands of hectares of maples on the sloping field are so red that you would recognize them as fallen petals by mistake if looking from a further area . The bright red , pink , scarlet , and peach-puff leaves are distributed in different layout , with some green pines and cypresses dotted in between . __eou__ Sounds marvelous . __eou__ You can take a bird-eye view at the glorious picture when you arrive at the top of the mountain . __eou__ Great . I will prepare some clothes and food for the climbing . __eou__
Did you see the way that Brian came to work yesterday ? Ever since he came back from that conference in Silicon Valley , he's been coming to work dressed in jeans and sweatshirts . It's like he's decided to make himself at home in his office . I don't know how long it'll take before the management talks to him about it . __eou__ He was really influenced by the way they do things on the west coast . I guess the working atmosphere is a lot more relaxed and casual in California . It comes from the information technology industry .. there isn't such a large division between home and office , so people want to work in the clothes they feel more relaxed in . __eou__ Maybe so , but it seems kind of strange , which the rest of us in white shirts , dark suites , and ties . __eou__ It's not as bad as that ... We are allowed to wear more casual jackets and trousers . Besides , didn't you hear what Brian found on his desk this morning ? __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ Management decided to give him four brand new white shirts . That's their way of telling him that his new style of dressing down is not quite acceptable . __eou__
Good morning , ladies and gentlemen , we are happy you have all come out for our training workshop . Today we have a great line-up of speakers to talk to you . First on our program is a well-renown expert in the field of international economic development , Harvard's own Dr . James Smith . Dr . Smith has been involved in economic research for over twenty years , and has taught at Harvard since 1995 . And now , without further adieu , we'd like to welcome Mr . James Smith . __eou__ Thank you , Mr . Jackson , ladies and gentlemen , colleagues , friends . The subject of my talk is international relations in a morgen world . I plan to say a few words about the current situation in the Middle East and how it affects world economy . I'd like to give you an overview of the way that the economies of seemingly unrelated countries are intertwined . I've divided my talk into three parts , first an overview of international relations , second a discussion of current political situations , and lastly trends for the future . My presentation will take about two hours , but there will be a twenty-minute break in the middle . We'll stop for lunch at 12 . __eou__
Did you hear what's going on downtown today ? All the orders from the factory are staging a demonstration in the streets . Not one of the two thousand employees showed up for work today , and they have gathered outside the city hall to demand better working conditions for all factory employees . __eou__ Wow , sounds chaotic ... two thousand people in the streets carrying picket signs and shouting slogans . What gave them the motivation to finally organize and call management on the substandard working conditions ? __eou__ I think they gained courage after the mayor's speech last week on equality and opportunity for all town citizens . Anyway , the sentiments have been brewing for quite some time . I mean , we all know the working conditions at the factory are quite horrendous . __eou__ So what kind of demands do they have ? What are they asking for specifically ? __eou__ They want raises and medical insurance , and I think they want to clean up the factory's safety hazards . That's probably the most important issue . __eou__
If only our company prescribe flex time . __eou__ The board has been considering introducing flex time . __eou__ Good news . Ah , what if be even better if alternative work place is provided . __eou__ Then our entire job could be done by telecommuting . __eou__
Have you watched any of the talent shows on TV ? __eou__ Yes , I've watched the finale for the ' Super Girl ' . The producer is very smart to copy the program from the US , which is quite fresh and eye-catching for mainland audiences . __eou__ Yeah , and they know exactly what the audiences have in mind . Everyone desires equal opportunities and a channel to climb up the social ladder all the way to the highest in society . __eou__ That ' s why the program has attracted so many star-wanna-bes . __eou__ But it seems that these talent shows are getting less popular these days . There's no such program on this year . __eou__ Yeah , these programs are gradually losing their appeal . __eou__ No surprise . The over-the-top promotion has ruined the audiences ' appetite . __eou__ And they lack originality . Talent shows like ' Super Girl ' and ' Super Boy ' are largely clones of ' The American Idol ' . __eou__ The same is true for ' My Hero ' . Winners of the contest used to star in the TV series ' The Frog Prince ' . __eou__ I think producers are underestimating the audience . They should think of better ways to entertain the general public . __eou__
How did your company's fundraiser go ? __eou__ The fundraiser events went really well . We were able to partner with a few of our competitors , all in fun of course , to sponsor a marathon for the American Cancer Society . All of the people who participated it had a great time , and we were able to raise a lot of money to contribute to cancer research . __eou__ So how does it work ? How were you able to make money with the marathon ? __eou__ Each of the runners that participated the marathon race paid a ten dollar entrance fee . Also , they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran . All in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars . __eou__ Sounds like a great deal for the American Cancer Society . __eou__ In all honesty , it's also a great deal for our company . The exposure that we gained from sponsoring an invent like this was great for our image in the community . We accomplished as much as last year's advertising campaign , plus we were able to do a little fundraising for a good cause . __eou__
Oh , Ralph , I heard it is very dangerous traveling in space . Disasters have happened before . If the spaceship were out of order . . . __eou__ You should be optimistic about this . Things have taken a good turn . You should remember that less than two centuries ago the dangers of train travel seemed similarly terrible . __eou__ But is it possible that travelers could be hit by meteors ? __eou__ It's once in blue moon . __eou__ What do you think is the real danger man faced in space ? __eou__ The main one is radiation . There are two sorts of radiation man must fear in space . The first is radiation from the sun , and this is particularly dangerous when the sun is very active and explosions are occurring on its surface . The second , less harmful , comes from the so-called Van Allen Belts . __eou__
Look ! Mom , that's amazing ! I can't believe the girls have so neat movements . __eou__ Yeah , they all received very strict training . A minute on the stage takes ten-year practice . __eou__ And all their movements are so elegant . It seems like dancing in the water . __eou__ Exactly , you know , water ballet puts dancing , music and swimming together . __eou__ There you go ! Daddy has told me that water ballet is also called Synchronized Swimming . __eou__ That's my boy ! Katherine Curtis created this activity in 1920 . And in 1984 , it was authorized as one activity in Olympic Games . __eou__ Wow , Mom is more knowledgeable than Dad . I must learn from you . __eou__ My little boy , you should learn more from me . I'm almost thirty years older than you . __eou__ OK , you're the boss . Look , Mom , one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool . __eou__ Oh , my God . It's so dangerous . And he might break his leg . You mustn't do anything like that . __eou__
I've something very unpleasant to talk with you . Upon the arrival of the first consignment , it was found that about 50 % of the sixty cases of pineapples were leaking . __eou__ It's rather an unusual case . Have you found the cause of leaking ? __eou__ It ’ s simply because the tins were damaged . __eou__ It appears to be the only case to us , that the goods have been damaged on the way . __eou__ I am sorry to say it's not on the way , but during loading . The tins inside the cases were broken evidently through rough handling . __eou__ Could you offer us a certificate issued by your Health Department ? __eou__ Certainly . Here you are . Our health authorities said they were no longer suitable for human consumption . I have to remind you that our terms are CIF Hamburg . I hope you would indemnify us for the loss , so it wouldn't be so heavy on us . __eou__ Now we are prepared to settle the issue with you amicably . __eou__
Ms.Green , are the schools more or less similar everywhere throughout the United States , or do they differ in various sections ? __eou__ The system of public schools is fairly uniform everywhere throughout the United States . __eou__ Do most students in the United States attend private schools or public schools ? __eou__ Most public schools in the United States are very good , and the majority of students attend the public schools . __eou__ Which students go to private schools , then ? __eou__ Children needing special instruction . Children whose parents can afford to send them to private schools , and children whose parents want them to receive a religious education . __eou__ But are the public schools good everywhere ? __eou__ No , public schools can be very different . Even in the same city . __eou__ Dose it cost anything to attend the public schools ? Are there any restrictions as to who may and may not attend ? __eou__ The public schools in the United States are free to everyone and there is no cost to the student . In most states , even the textbooks are free . There are no restrictions as to color , race , or religion.Any student wishing to attend the public schools may do so . __eou__
I am totally fed up with my boss . He has crossed the line one too many times with his sexist comments . This time I am really going to report him for sexual harassment . __eou__ What happened ? Did your boss say something to offend you at work ? __eou__ He constantly lets inappropriate things slip out , referring to the women employees as girls or calling us sweetheart or darling . I doubt any of my male colleagues would stand for such treatment . __eou__ Don ’ t you think you are overreacting a little ? Calling you by nicknames shouldn ’ t be so bad ... __eou__ You ’ re missing the point . It ’ s about respect . He treats us with such a patronizing attitude , as if we are not equal or not as serious as our male co-workers . It ’ s his attitude that needs to be changed , not just his words . __eou__ That ’ s what you get for working in a male-dominated field . I think you ’ ll find that most male bosses in your industry are already conditioned to treat females in this way . You probably won ’ t be able to change him . __eou__
So what did you think about the movie ? __eou__ Well , I think this Star Wars episode is an excellent piece of work , but not as good as the previous ones . __eou__ Really ? I don't agree . This Star Wars episode was incredible ! __eou__ Why do you think so ? __eou__ Well , one of the most spectacular things about this one was the special effects . State of the art special effects are the main reason for the success of previous episodes , so audiences have high expectations for this one , and I don't think they will be disappointed . __eou__ You are right . The special effects were amazing . And I like the fact that they created so many fantastic settings and otherworldly costumes , weapons and creatures . __eou__ It's kind of cool that they are still using the same Star Wars theme song for this movie . __eou__ Yeah ! It reminds me of the previous Star Wars scenes . __eou__ I know exactly what you mean . Hearing that song gives me a nostalgic feeling . __eou__ I thought the overall plot of the movie was very interesting , but I don't think the character development was that strong . __eou__ Do you think that they had anything to do with the casting of the movie ? __eou__ No , the casting is great and the actors were excellent . They just didn ’ t have a lot of funny or meaningful dialogues . The writing was also a little weak . __eou__ Well , maybe . But I like the little kid who played Manakin Skywalker . I can't imagine anyone else playing that role . __eou__ I liked him too . He is so cute ! You know , even though I was slightly disappointed , I can't wait for the next episode . I wonder when they ’ re going to start making it and when it ’ s scheduled for release ? __eou__ I've no idea . But looking at the success of Star Wars episode , I've a strong feeling production for the next episode will be selling pretty soon . I hope It will be even better than this one . __eou__ I hope so , too . __eou__ Well , I think we should go now . It's getting pretty late . __eou__ Okay , let's go ! __eou__
Just as the saying goes , every potter praises his own pot . You should pay special attention to selling yourself properly in the interview . __eou__ It is especially important for the graduates who step into the job market for the first time . __eou__ You'd better prepare what you are going to say in advance , in order to have a good performance in the interview . __eou__ The contents should be mainly descriptions of your background . And the length depends on the particular situation . __eou__ Only when you are aware of what the interviewer will be interested in , can you make a targeted preparation . __eou__ To sell yourself successfully , you should leave the interviewer a deep impression . __eou__ Selling yourself should go straight to the point , and the statement should be clear and brief . __eou__ It should also be truthful and realistic . Do not blindly blow your own horn . __eou__ You should particularly state your strong points which are closely related to the position you are applying for . __eou__ While you should not omit your weak points , they need to be described appropriately __eou__ Time permitted , you could add certain examples to your description . __eou__ Besides , in the interview , it is best that you make corresponding adjustments to apply your prepared contents flexibly . __eou__
The consignments of chemical instruments have just reached us . We have to lodge a claim against you for inferior quality I am afraid . __eou__ Is there anything wrong ? __eou__ We bought 1,000 sets of chemical instruments from you , but there are 40 not up to the standard . __eou__ It's hard for us to believe it . Our instruments have been the best quality for years . Have you any reliable evidence ? __eou__ Here is the survey report from a well-known public surveyor in London . You may inspect the defective instruments personally __eou__ Well . According to the contract , we are responsible for repairing or replacing those defective instruments . We ’ ll send our technicians to repair them . __eou__ Forty faulty instruments means that 4 % are not up to the standard . You should compensate us for 4 % of the total account on the contract , as well as for the inspection fee . __eou__ I am sorry about the quality problem , but I propose we compensate you for 3 % of the total value apart from the inspection fee . __eou__ All right . In that case we are still willing to do business with you . __eou__
That price of ours , by the way , is for a minimum quantity of 1,000 saddles . __eou__ Yes , I noticed that . To what extent would local assembly help sales , did you say ? __eou__ 20-30 % . But we proposed the plan from the storage and delivery viewpoint . That is to say , less warehouse space and prompt delivery . __eou__ Yes , of course . Assembly would be quite a simple matter . Cycle dealers could put them together in a very short time . __eou__ Sales have been exceptionally good during the past twelve months . __eou__ Yes , I've noticed that . Where have you been placing them ? __eou__ All in the local market . One or two suggestions that came in from the distribution might interest you . __eou__ Yes . What were they ? Anything that will help sales ? __eou__ Perhaps . General opinion is that the rear carrier should be offered as an extra . __eou__ That's to keep the price down , I suppose . I'll take it up with our overseas department and listen to what they've got to say about this . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
As an experienced interviewer , could you tell me what kind of behavior the interviewer hates most ? __eou__ Rudeness . You are not expected to sit down before being invited , and you shouldn ’ t throw yourself into the chair like you ’ re loading heavy baggage . __eou__ And we should have good sitting posture . __eou__ That ’ s right . The ideal posture for women is to put their legs together and lean to one side . This is especially important in summer . __eou__ Where should I put my overcoat and briefcase after entering the office ? __eou__ Put it beside you . Don ’ t pile your purses , briefcase and other belongings on the employer ’ s desk . You've got long hair . Don ’ t touch it while talking to the interviewer . It gives people the feeling that you cannot concentrate on your work . __eou__ I think that ’ s the reason why Princess Diana ’ s hair style became so popular . __eou__ Also , if you are asked to sit beside the employer's desk , neither lean on it nor look at the documents there . __eou__ I ought to respect other people ’ s privacy , as most Westerners do . __eou__ As the saying goes , when in Rome , do as the Romans do . __eou__
Tell me something about yourself and your past . __eou__ I was born and grew up in hebes Province . I moved to Beijing , where I started taking courses for my MBA . When I completed my degree , I was offered an opportunity working for a financial services company . I've worked there for eight years . __eou__ What was the most significant project you've worked on ? __eou__ I was assigned a project to design a 360 - degree performance system . It was a challenge for a person with a finance background . I met with the technical people and discussed the possibilities and obstacles . Based on that information , I selected a team and created a spreadsheet to manage the project . We got the project done on schedule . I was rewarded for outstanding results and was able to share the honors with the team . __eou__ What finance experience makes you qualified for this position ? __eou__ For the past eight years , I have been working in the banking industry . I have a solid understanding of accounting concepts , an analytical mind and a strong attention to detail . I've had a lot of customer service training and experience , and I have been told that I excel in this area . __eou__ How would your coworkers evaluate you ? __eou__ They'd say I was a handworker and a real team player . __eou__ What are your salary expectations ? __eou__ I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . I'd like to postpone that decision until later . __eou__
Wow , this is drop-dead gorgeous . __eou__ So no more regret now ? __eou__ Don't remind me of that . This would be the last time I cut any classes for a basketball game . __eou__ Come on . Don't be so hard on yourself . Enjoy your life . __eou__ I just can't help it . Oh , look at Clive , he is really a big hit . They are definitely gonna win . __eou__ It's only seven minutes into the game , too early to cheer up . __eou__ Come on , 18 points already , they are never gonna catch up . __eou__ Who knows ! It's a long game . Look ! That was a really nice shot ! __eou__ Thay are coming back to narrow the gap . __eou__ Wait , that guy , I know him . He is just a bench warmer . __eou__ A secret weapon . They'd better set up the defense now . __eou__ Clive is ready to explode . Keep your eyes open . __eou__ Oh , man ! I can't believe it . A slam dunk ! __eou__ Good that he resembled his old , quick self . __eou__
So it looks like we start selling in the U . S . next year . __eou__ Did Mr . Lin put you in charge of marketing ? __eou__ He's still not sure whether he wants to put me in charge , or whether he wants to hire an American.But even if he hires an American , I'll probably be transferred to our American office . __eou__ Where will it be ? __eou__ We aren't sure yet . Maybe L . A . I think L . A . would be the best idea . __eou__ Is it because of trade negotiations that we can start selling in the U . S . ? __eou__ Yes , the recent agreements between the two governments have changed everything.Now we have the right to sell in America at a much lower tariff.It ' s going to be good . We can compete more directly with them . __eou__ Great . __eou__ Our computers have a high level of quality now.We can demonstrate it . And our prices will be good.So I think it will really be worthwhile . __eou__ You seem excited about it . __eou__ Well , you know I studied marketing in America.So maybe the thought of going back there to promote our brand is kind of exciting to me . I'd love to be part of the team . __eou__ Do you honestly think we can compete though ? All the computer giants are there . __eou__ Yes , I do . I think we can compete . I think we can make a name for ourselves.It will be hard at first . But if we develop a good advertising campaign , I think we can break into the market . __eou__ The company will have to choose a good advertising firm.And then there's the problem of quality.How do we convince American buyers that our quality is good ? __eou__ It takes some time.Because even if the quality is high , people won't accept a high tech product unless they recognize the name.Name recognition is crucial . __eou__ Well , I hope it all works out , John . I think if you're part of the team , things will go well.But you know we'd all miss you here . So I won't say I'm happy to think that you're leaving . __eou__ That's very nice of you to say.But if we set up an office there in the States , maybe you could try to become part of it . __eou__ Me ? No way . I'm dedicated to the company , but I'm not going to leave Taiwan . I'm happy here . __eou__
Hello Mike ! Would you like a drink ? __eou__ No , thank you . I had too much to drink yesterday evening . I had a bad hangover this morning . My head felt terrible . __eou__ Were you celebrating something ? __eou__ Yes . It was a friend ’ s birthday party . We drank all kinds of things-beer , wine and spirits . After midnight , we were even drinking cocktails ! __eou__ It ’ s a bad idea to drink a combination of alcoholic drinks . You should stick with one for the whole evening . __eou__ I know , but it was a celebration , you Kwon ? I don ’ t think I ’ Ve see you drunk . __eou__ I usually only drink beer and I rarely drink more than a few pints . __eou__ You are a sensible drinker . Anyway , I ’ m not going to drink any alcohol this evening . I don ’ t ’ want another bad hangover . __eou__ Let me buy you a soft drink then . How about a coke ? __eou__ Yeah . That ’ s a good idea . I heard that coke was first used as a medicine . __eou__ Rally ? ... barman ! ... a large coke with ice and lemon , please ... thanks . Here ’ s the money . __eou__ Are you going to the wine tasting tomorrow ? __eou__ Yes . I thought it might be interesting to learn a little about wine ... __eou__ ... and taste a few ! There will be wines from several countries and an expert to give advice on which wines are good and which ones are not . __eou__ Yes . I ’ m looking forward to it . __eou__
How often do you service the pump ? __eou__ We take very good care of this particular pump . It's a crucial part of our process . We clean it and flush it through at the end of every shift , We check the high pressure seals , recalibrate the gauges and lubricate all moving parts weekly . We replace the gaskets every month . __eou__ How do you decide how often these things need to be done ? __eou__ Well , from experience we can predict the lifespan of different components . We try to replace components before they fail or wear out . This prevents the equipment from breaking down . It also saves us a lot of trouble ! __eou__
Have you seen the sales report for last quarter ? Who do you think is our digest threat ? __eou__ From the numbers , it seems like Forest Inc . is our digest competitor ... Le'Ban and Markford are also major contenders in our market . __eou__ Le'Ban is the new kid on the block , it's amazing they've had such tremendous success so soon ... With them on the scene , the competition is outthrough . __eou__ here's information about our competitor's recent market activities ... __eou__ Thanks , this will be a big help in putting together next quarter's marketing strategies . With competition this intense , we'll have to step up production even more . We need a price we can compete with . __eou__ We're in a very competitive environment . It's sink or saimin this market . __eou__ Better start swimming ! we've got to find a way to outsmart the other guys . I want a preliminarily strategic marketing plan on my desk by next Tuesday ... the competition never sleeps and neither should we . __eou__
Your definition on success ? __eou__ Most people think that wealth means success . But from my point of view , the problem should be viewed from two aspects . On the one hand , wealth is a very important thing to measure success . The ability to make money , to some extent , signifies your knowledge , your capability , the value of your labor , etc .. With the development of our economy and industry , more and more people are pursuing money these days . And in toda / s society , If you have money , you seem to have everything . But this is not the case . I think success , on the other hand , also means satisfaction from work . It also means that you can get respect from others . __eou__ What ’ s your ideal job ? __eou__ Ideally , I ’ d like to have a job that will allow me to work from home several days a week . I ’ m the kind of person who can set priorities , work well independently , and set my own pace . I actually successfully worked from home for several months in my current job when a problematic pregnancy forced me to stay in bed . But I realize that many employers do not have experience with employees who work from home , and I have , of course , performed very successfully in a traditional office setting . __eou__ How would you describe your relationship with your last two supervisors ? __eou__ Very good . Basically , once our sales plan was put together , I had a great deal of freedom to handle my sales in the way I felt best . __eou__ How would your present boss describe you ? __eou__ He always says I am a hard worker with consciousness of responsibility , sufficient education , and enough experience . __eou__ What would your colleagues say about you ? __eou__ They would say I am a dependable friend and a capable colleague . __eou__
What made you decide on this type of occupation ? __eou__ Oh , to tell you the truth , I love the sky . When I was a child , I imagined flying into the blue sky some day . Now , I think the day has come . My dream will come true . And I like travelling very much and I enjoy working with people . __eou__ Can you make yourself understood in English without too much difficulty ? __eou__ Yes , I think I am quite fluent in English . I got the certificate of the Secondary English Training last month . __eou__ Do you know what the responsibilities are for a stewardess ? __eou__ The main responsibility of the stewardess is to make the passengers relaxed and happy during the flight . And good service is also important . __eou__ Are you in good health ? __eou__ I just had a complete physical examination and I am in top condition . __eou__ Have you had any nursing experience ? __eou__ Yes , I have two years of nursing experience , and now I am working as a nurse in a hospital . __eou__ How tall are you ? What about your eyesight ? __eou__ My height is one meter and sixty-eight centimeters . I've never had any vision problems . __eou__ What would you say are your strengths and weaknesses ? __eou__ One of my strengths is my friendliness and open-minded attitude and also I think I have a warm personality . But sometimes , I find it is hard to tell others when I don't like what they are doing . __eou__ If a passenger can't understand what you say , what should you do ? __eou__ I'll try to speak in another language or I'll try my best to use gestures and draw pictures . __eou__
Looking through your C . V . , I see that you graduated from Oklahoma State University . Can you tell me what training you have had that would specifically relate to the cable television Industry ? __eou__ Well , I ’ Ve attended some conferences in this field . But the most relevant training I ’ Ve had was in computer design . I believe I could integrate that knowledge with my college degree to design __eou__ I see . Did you have anything specific in mind ? __eou__ Well , I notice that you currently provide an on-screen TV Guide . At the moment , it just scrolls the names of the programs in a repeated loop . If you have many channels , you have to wait a long t __eou__ That ’ s impressive . How would you make that pay ? __eou__ Tie it in with the pay-per-view services , and perhaps it could be a money-maker . __eou__ I see you have several good ideas . Now , I just have a few questions about your C . V . I notice that there is a five-year gap between your last job and now . __eou__ Yes , I took a break from work during that time . I had a baby , and as she was born with a handicap , I decided to suspend my career . But I have continued to keep up with the Industry through con __eou__ So , you ’ re just starting back . Maybe you ’ d better tell me a little more about your experience . __eou__
Hey , May . How about getting together for a movie tonight ? __eou__ Sure . What's playing ? __eou__ Well , Let me check the newspaper . What about The Terminal ? __eou__ Wow , it stars Catherine Zeta-Jones , my favorite actress . __eou__ Well , birds of a feather flock together . I like her too . She was in a lot of dramas . __eou__ She is so beautiful and elegant . And she is famous for her fine acting . __eou__ What's more , she doesn't have scandals . And she likes to take part in the charitable activities . __eou__ Who is the director ? __eou__ Steven Spielberg . Another superstar . __eou__ Yes , a legend , also . I still remember , his movies , Jurassic Park and Schindler's List got him nine Oscar awards in 1994 . __eou__ Can you introduce the story of The Terminal briefly ? __eou__ It tells a romantic and humorous love story . __eou__ This is really exciting movie . Lets go to this one . __eou__
have you read the feature article about Oprah Winfrey in this magazine ? __eou__ no , what's it about ? __eou__ apparently , she's being given an award for donating so much money to charity . __eou__ she's very generous with her money . I think that's because she was poor when she was young . __eou__ I heard that she's one of the wealthiest women in the world . __eou__ I'd believe it . She owns magazines , television shows and she has a huge fan base . __eou__ you know ; I heard that she was opening a school for underprivileged girls in Africa . __eou__ did they mention that in the article ? __eou__ yes , she's not only building the school , but is also using her own money for the upkeep of the school and to pay the teachers a fair salary . __eou__ that's really commendable . I think more celebrities should use their money to help people like Oprah has . __eou__ I agree . So many celebrities waste their money on sports cars , expensive clothing , and luxurious hotels . __eou__ it's amazing how much money they can spend . I heard Britney Spears once spent $ 24,000 a night on a hotel room ! __eou__ what a waste . It's good to see some stars that are more concerned with charity than status symbols . __eou__
How are you doing ? Pretty good , I imagine ? __eou__ Actually not so good . That's why we made a special trip to see you . __eou__ OK , let me hear it . I'd be glad to help if I can . __eou__ Good . I want to discuss with you the mode of payment for the construction of the power plant under negotiation . __eou__ Well , I trust that your presence will hasten the settlement of payment terms . __eou__ I would like to explain to you our financial position . The manufacture of machinery and its accessories and parts will consume both time and money . It takes five years to manufacture the machinery and we will have to advance the cost for the main machines to be produced , and besides this there are large sums to be paid to our subcontractors for the manufacture of the accessories and parts . __eou__ But for an enterprise of your size , an order from us will certainly not embarrass you financially . __eou__ Well , in fact , it is beyond our financial capability . __eou__ In what way can we solve the problem ? __eou__ Have you considered the possibility of a buyer's credit ? __eou__ Yes . But the sum is large , it must be provided by a group of banks . __eou__ So , we propose your company apply to Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation for a long-term loan . Six months before each shipment , you through Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation open , in our favour , an irrevocable , dividable L / C which is to remain valid for two months . __eou__ Well , we accept your suggestion . __eou__
... Now that we have been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter , Ed ! Give us some good news . How are things looking for us in terms sales this month ? __eou__ Uh well ... would you like the bad news first or the really bad news ? __eou__ What ? Ed , don ’ t tell me you only have bad news ! __eou__ Well sir , our sales have dropped , no plunged , fifty percent in the past month alone . We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits refalling fast . The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory , or getting rid of our staff . If we consider redundancies , it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages . It ’ s a real mess . __eou__ For crying out loud ... How fast are we losing money ? __eou__ Um ... how can I put this ? Let ’ s just say that at this pace , we will be filing for Chapter eleven in less than three months . __eou__ What ! Geez ! How could this have happened ? So what ’ s the bad news ? __eou__ Oh , that ’ s the really bad news . Our supplier suffered QC problems and , well , half of our production is faulty . We ’ re going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter . And the worst part ? We ’ re going to have to shoulder this cost . __eou__ Are you joking ? Get the supplier on the line now ! They have to assume the costs of this mess ! __eou__ We tried that , sir . The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country . __eou__ We ’ re doomed ! __eou__ There is some really good news though ! __eou__ Really ? What ! __eou__ I got offered a new job ! __eou__
What would you like to drink ? Tea or coffee ? __eou__ Coffee , please . __eou__ So , you also like Coffee ? __eou__ Yes , of course . I can't go through a day without coffee in the morning . __eou__ Me too , but I think we shouldn't drink too much of it , as it's not very healthy . __eou__ I totally disagree . The other day I read in a book that a number of recent studies suggest that it can be a highly beneficial drink . Researchers have found strong evidence that coffee reduces the risk of several serious aimed 3 ' including diabetes , heart disease and cirrhosis of the liver . __eou__ But I also heard that coffee and its caffeine content , serve as a drug on the human body that negatively affects the central nervous system , as well as other organs , and leads to addiction __eou__ I don't think so . Coffee helps me wake up , keep alert , and improve my short term memory . __eou__ Well , I adjust going to have to disagree with you . A healthy body wakes up without caffeine ! __eou__ Maybe you are right to some extent . __eou__ You may try to have some alternatives and see how you feel . __eou__ Maybe I could have a try . __eou__
We have some quality-control problems . Mr . Zhang . We need to go to the source to work them out . __eou__ What problems are you having exactly ? __eou__ The complaint rate for our new product line is very high , almost eight percent . __eou__ That is high . __eou__ Yes . We keep finding problems when testing the sound boards . __eou__ But your promotional materials claim the broads are the least expensive of their types on the market . __eou__ The least expensive , but still fully functional . And we think that your factory needs to take measures to improve quality-control . __eou__ That will involve additional expenses for us , which we will have to pass on to you as a rate hike . __eou__ I am afraid that is not acceptable . Your contract says that you will deliver a product with a reject rate of less than six percent . __eou__ Well . I will tell you what , Mr . Li . I will review the contract and talk with management . Then we will get together and hash this out . __eou__
Hey there Chris , what are you up to ? __eou__ I'm just poring over some brochures about various car models . __eou__ Oh , so you're thinking about buying a new car ? __eou__ Yeah , it looks that way . My wife has been bugging me about it . I thought we could probably survive without one , but with a baby on the way , maybe it is time to get a car . __eou__ So this would be your first automobile ? __eou__ That's right . For quite a few years , I rode a bicycle to work . Then I got a motorbike . __eou__ Yeah , I think I can understand your wife's position . Asking her to ride on a motorcycle when she's pregnant is a tall order . __eou__ Oh ... I don't let her ride with me . It's just too dangerous . She takes the bus to work , but it is sometimes difficult to get a seat and it's crowded and hot . __eou__ So it's time to buy your very first car ! Wow , that's exciting ! __eou__ Yes , but it's also a pretty big financial responsibility . __eou__ Yeah . I still remember my first car . It was an old clunker that my dad gave me when I turned 17 . I drove it around for a couple of years until I scraped together enough money to buy a better secondhand car . __eou__ I'm having a hard time deciding which model is best for us . __eou__ Yeah , it is a tough call . Each one has its pros and cons . Are you looking for a sedan ? __eou__ Yes , I'd like a Jeep , but my wife says we have to get a comfortable sedan for long drives home to see her relatives . __eou__ I'd advise you to listen to your wife . She will be sitting in the back taking care of the kids so whatever she prefers is probably the best choice . __eou__
We have the capital ready.Right now I am looking at three different companies to produce our products.And your company , Mr . Chen , seems to me to be the best for what we want . __eou__ I appreciate your remarks . And we are always happy to do more business.But , you know , if we take on a contract to produce new products , we want to be confident the product is marketable . Because , to start producing new things requires a lot of preparation.It requires a lot of investment for us . __eou__ You have some doubts about our products , I understand . __eou__ I would like to offer you a good price.But I won't be able to do that if I think this is a one-shot deal.So I would like to have some confidence in your idea . __eou__ Of course . Let me tell you in some detail about our idea.You know the popular Hello Kitty products . __eou__ Yes , of course . __eou__ Well , the products in themselves are very simple.It is the logo that is successful.So , Hello Kitty is successful because of the logo , but the products are very simple . __eou__ And I would say the logo is successful mainly because it comes from Japan.It is the Japanese that have made it a fad . __eou__ That might be true.But we have a logo concept that is great . It is really great . I think it will catch on in Taiwan at least . Young people will love it.It is because of our logo that our products will sell.We just need someone to produce the products for us.We have the backup and people to do the marketing . __eou__ So what you are really trying to sell is a fad . __eou__ Yes , we would like to make things like key chains , plastic pencil sharpeners , plastic rulers , watches , wallets , things like that.Little accessories for young people . But the reason these will sell is the logo.Just like Hello Kitty . __eou__ I understand . But why won't you show me the logo ? __eou__ Because it hasn't been copyrighted . We want to get some protection for it.But while we wait for copyright , we are investigating companies to produce the products . __eou__ I see . The problem , however , is that I can't be confident in giving you a good priceless I am confident your product will last . __eou__ I understand . For now , though , you could just give us an estimated price.We aren't going to sign a contract yet . We are just investigating . I only need to know that your company is capable of producing the products.And then , I only need a very rough idea of how much it might cost . __eou__ Alright . I understand . Right now you just want estimates . __eou__ Yes . __eou__
So what are you doing for Thanksgiving ? __eou__ Not much really . It's more of an American tradition , so back home we don't really celebrate it . In fact , I am not even sure of what exactly is being celebrated ! __eou__ Well you know , it's a time to get together with all your family and be thankful for everything ! __eou__ Yeah but , how did this holiday come to be ? __eou__ Well , the first settlers of Massachusetts arrived there because of religious persecution from England and King James . Once in the New World , they befriended an native named Squanto , who taught them how to harvest food from the area such as corn . __eou__ And then what did happen ? __eou__ Well , they had enough harvests for the next winter and celebration 。 They decided to have a big feast for the natives , giving thanks the land , and everyone for the foods , healthy and new lives . __eou__ Interesting ! I am amazed how big and delicious thanksgiving dinners are ! __eou__ Come to my house for Thanksgiving ! We are having turkey , pumpkin pie , mashed potatoes with gravy , and lots of stuffing ! __eou__ Count me in ! __eou__
How do you like this dress ? __eou__ It's nice . But what kind of dress are you looking for ? __eou__ Something attractive and dressy . Maybe a little sexy too . New Year's Eve is a special occasion and it only happens once a year , right ? __eou__ Of course . It's common too that we wear something special for our Chinese New Year . __eou__ People here always wear the best clothes they have . Many people go out and buy clothes especially for New Year's Eve . __eou__ Any other common customs of your New Year ? __eou__ Before the New Year , we always send greeting cards to our relatives and friends to wish them a happy year . On the street and in stores people usually greet others with a ' Happy New Year ' . It's also common for people to make a New Year's resolution . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ It's when people quit a bad habit or do something they find hard to do . Many people resolve to quit smoking , lose weight , or stop nagging their wife , etc . However , it usually lasts only for a few days ! __eou__ By the way , where are you going on New Year's Eve ? __eou__ We're going to a night club for dinner and dancing , then we'll go down to the city square for the big celebration . There's always a fireworks display put on by the local government . We all want you to come too . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__
It's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed ... The trade deficit is getting larger , consumption's down , I really think we're headed for a recession . __eou__ The economy has been stagnant for a while now . We've been in a recessive state for several months already . What worries me the most is the trade deficit . I think the government should do more to encourage exports . __eou__ Increasing exports would weaken the currency . I think the main point is economic growth . We need more jobs . Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . If more people are working , it will give the economy a boost . __eou__ It's true that we should do something about unemployment , but what about inflation ? If unemployment falls , there's pressure to increase pay . That would result in inflation , which would result in a much less dynamic economy . __eou__
Did you see the woman that just left my office ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ She's another applicant , and a leading contender , but I didn ’ t want to hire her . She ’ s qualified , but she doesn ’ t quite fit the profile . We ’ re looking for an accountant , and part of the job requires interacting with clients . Well , our clients want conservative people to handle their money . And green hair with ripped jeans doesn ’ t exactly fill them with trust . __eou__ But it's the style now . __eou__ I realize that , but our business is serving clients and giving them what they want . __eou__ Of course . __eou__ Well , they don ’ t want to deal with people who look like that . They want people who look more like yourself . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ Well , they ’ re older , and they don ’ t understand today's fashions . When they see someone dressed like that , warning bells go off . They don ’ t like that style at all , and they don ’ t like dealing with people who dress like that at work . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__ We used to have a woman here who dressed like that and she was good , very good . But , the clients reacted very negatively when they saw her . Some asked that their account be given to someone who dressed more conservatively . __eou__ What happened to her ? __eou__ Well , she was a very good employee and we wanted to keep her , so her supervisor called her in for a chat and laid it on the line for her . She got the idea and now she saves the trendy styles for evenings and weekends . __eou__ I see . __eou__
George speaks Japanese better than Frank . __eou__ Yet in writing , George has nothing on Frank . __eou__ Therefore , I hope they could help each other and learn from each other . __eou__
OK , Ann , you spent quite a bit of time in Australia recently so why don't you talk about that ? __eou__ I really liked living in Australia . I was an international student and I studied education at the university of Sydney . And living in Sydney was fantasticbecuase I could go to the beach anytime I wanted and there was a great nightlife in Sydney . There are lots of great clubs . And people were very , very friendly and easy-going and I met a lot of international people in living Sydney . __eou__ Mm-hm . How long were you there ? __eou__ I was there for almost a year . __eou__ Oh , OK . __eou__ And I travelled a little bit in Australia . I went up the east coast . Up to Frasier Island . Which is a world heritage site . And I saw dingo running along the beach and sharks in the water . We climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the ... , which is a but north . And the further north you go in Australia , the hotter it gets . So we were able to go swimming in the ocean and I went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky cause I didn't have a diving license , so I went on an introductory dive and I saw a giant clam that had a really purple spongy inside that I was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly . __eou__ So , did you , did you lose your finger ? __eou__ Almost . __eou__ Almost . Ah , you're lucky . Um , it's funny , you go in the water and you worry about sharks , but not clams . __eou__ Exactly . __eou__ Will you be going back to Australia soon ? __eou__ I'd like to go and live there for at least another year . Probably I'll go back to Sydney or maybe I'll go down to Melbourne because it's a really interesting cultural city . They have lot of museums and parks . __eou__
How did you enjoy your family party at “ ginger ’ s ” ? I hear that they have a lovely menu and buffet . __eou__ Oh , it was great . We had seafood buffet . They do one every Friday . The waiters and waitresses are very good . They are very attentive , but don ’ t hang around the table . __eou__ I like the buffets they have , but if often order a la carte , because I don ’ t feel extremely hungry . I like the wine list there too . __eou__ Yes , so do I . they have wines from all over the world . There is a good range of prices to suit every pocket . We ordered some Australian red wine , which tasted delicious and wasn ’ t expensive . __eou__ Some restaurants allow you to take your own wine and just charge you corkage , but the don ’ t do that at “ ginger ’ s ” . what was included in the seafood buffet ? __eou__ They had almost every kind of seafood . There were oyster , shrimp , prawns , crabs , and fish . I ate a lot of smoked salmon . __eou__ Did they have lobster ? __eou__ No , they didn ’ t . you could order it from the menu . I think that lobster is too expensive to be included in the buffet . __eou__ Yes , it probably is . I don ’ t like ordering oysters in restaurants . You never know whether they are fresh . __eou__ I know . I didn ’ t eat any , but a few people in our group did and no one got sick . __eou__ When you eat out , do you usually eat from the buffet ? __eou__ Not usually . I usually just order a main course and have a dessert if I ’ m still hungry afterwards . __eou__ Oh , you don ’ t usually have a starter ? __eou__ No , I might have a soup if it ’ s a cold winter day . __eou__
Oh , this is Monica __eou__ OK . Commodity inspection is really an important part of our trade contract . __eou__ Yes . Let's first define the inspection right . __eou__ Following the rules of world business , the exporters have the right to inspect the goods before the delivery , while the importers have the right to re-inspect the goods after their arrival . __eou__ Would you tell me how the inspection is conducted before shipment and by which agency ? __eou__ Inspection is to be done by the China Commodity Inspection and Testing Bureau . Usually inspection is conducted within five days before each shipment . __eou__ And can you tell me about the re-inspection ? __eou__ Yes . The re-inspection should be made within seven days upon the arrival , and if any discrepancy is found , the claim must be raised within one month . __eou__ I see . How do they make testing and analysis of this item ? __eou__ They always use the standard and method laid down in the contract . __eou__ What if the results from the two inspections do not coincide with each other ? __eou__ A seminar of technical specialists including the surveyors from both sides will be held to clarify which result is correct . __eou__
wow , the duck looks so delicious . Should we order it , Rick ? __eou__ the chef is going to slice it into thin pieces . There will be around one hundred and twenty pieces of both skin and meat for each . __eou__ I see . The chef is so skillful with his knife . __eou__ absolutely . It is said that they serve 3,000 ducks every day . __eou__ incredible . By the way , what are these in the plates ? __eou__ oh , they are pancakes , hollowed sesame buns , scallions , cucumbers and oisin sauce . I will show you how to make one . __eou__ thank you . I couldn't wait any longer to have a taste . __eou__ Just roll it up and have a bite , Amy . __eou__ oh , it's terrific . I love the floor . Can you tell me how it was prepared ? __eou__ certainly . First , a Beijing duck is specially selected . After it is cleaned and dressed , it will be roasted in an open oven . Only wood of fruit trees are used to fuel the fire to give the duck a unique __eou__ it sounds really complicated . No wonder it tastes so great . __eou__ Yes , Amy , please have some more . __eou__
Finally the class is over . Be quick . Ben must have been waiting for long . __eou__ Oh , I am so tired . My back is sore and my neck hurts . __eou__ That's normal . You have been sitting for three hours , with your attention highly concentrated . __eou__ You are wrong , Shirley . I was always absent-minded in the class . I meant to concentrate on the class , but I was just so tired . Maybe I am old . __eou__ No . You are just burning yourself out these days . Have a good rest and you will feel energetic again . __eou__ One of my friends took the Adult College Entrance Exam last year . He filled the school column with his name , and his score was relinquished . __eou__ How could he make such a silly mistake ? __eou__ He said he hadn't taken any exams for ten years , and couldn't get used to it immediately . He was extremely nervous then . __eou__ He lost a very good chance to go to college , didn't he ? __eou__ Yeah . The test was fairly easy and almost every test-taker could pass that exam . Adult College Entrance Exam is much easier than college entrance exam . And there are fewer subjects . __eou__ That's a very good lesson . We must familiarize ourselves with the exam from now on . __eou__
Get up as early as six o'clock only to be jammed at every crossroad and still late for work . What a life ! I've had enough of it . __eou__ Cool down , man . Everyone is fed up with the rush-hour traffic . But life isn't really all that . You should take the initiative and make some changes first . __eou__ What should I do then ? __eou__ I recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus . It may offer you many benefits . First , it's good for your health . I'm afraid it's not necessary for me to further elaborate . While lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising , a bike ride to work not only builds you up , but also makes full use of time . You might as well sleep out for a longer hour . __eou__ I know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus . After all , it's a sport . But do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty , polled air on the road ? __eou__ Well , such things are just unavoidable in a great metropolis like Beijing . I think a still more desirable benefit is psychological . Bicycling home after work can help release your stress . Life in the offices is miserable . You just sit there in a daze , gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents . Why don't you give a full play to your energy after work ? Enjoy the speed on the road . Just think , you are flashing past the poles with your own energy . How great ! __eou__
Did you see the information on sales for last year ? The sales review was made at our last board meeting . There's a great news for our shareholders . __eou__ Yeah , I went over the figures this morning . We're finally started making money again ! __eou__ We've never sold this much before , our growth this year has been phenomenal . We have captured 8 % of the market , up from last year by 120 % . Our strategy is working ! __eou__ not only our annual sales brake a record , but our month by month earnings exceeded our forecast as well . After a two-year slump , we finally back in the black . __eou__ The company's performance has improved since Wallace became president . He's made our little business into a real lucrative operation . Products are selling like hotcakes . __eou__ I think our success is partly because of Wallace's contribution , and partly because of our new marketing strategy . Because of the new advertising campaign , we have become the top sellers in the field . __eou__ Let's hope this stroke of good luck lasts . I hope we are over our financial difficulties for good . __eou__ Let's hope it is ! __eou__
And so , I just wanted to check in with you and find out where we are with this project . As you know , you ’ Ve missed a fairly significant deadline last week , and this will negativity impact the team ’ s ability to move forward with the next stages of this project . __eou__ I know , I ’ m really sorry that I missed the deadline . But really , it wasn ’ t my fault . You see , we had all of these unexpected technical problems at the last minute , and that I couldn ’ t get into the database and extract the kind of information that I needed for the data analysis . You know , if the tech guys would have done their job and kept the ARM stable , then I wouldn ’ t have missed my deadline . __eou__ Oh , come on ! An excuse like that is tantamount to lying . You ’ re essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues , rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks . __eou__ No , I ’ m not trying to pass the buck here ; I know that it was me who is ultimately responsible for getting this done . But the thing is , I could have finished on time if the system hadn ’ t gone down . And you know , with everything I ’ Ve got going on now , I can ’ t afford to waste time dealing with technical problems . I ’ Ve got a lot on my plate and there are only twenty-four hours in a day ... __eou__ I ’ m not going to accept this excuse . You ’ re using these small technical glitches as a crutch and trying to rationalize the fact that you ’ Ve missed your deadline . Look , we have standards and I expect you to live up to those standards . No more phoney cases . If you ’ re in over your head , you tell me . No more missed deadlines . Now , I want that data on my desk by nine am ! __eou__
Good morning , my name is Martin . You've applied for the Laboratory Assistant's position , right ? __eou__ Yes . When I saw the advertisement I thought it would really suit me . __eou__ Can you tell me why you replied to our advertisement ? __eou__ I think that I'll be really good at this kind of work . In fact I learn so fast that I'll be looking for promotion very shortly . __eou__ Do you know exactly what you would be doing as a Laboratory Assistant ? __eou__ A laboratory assistant helps to maintain scientific equipment , keep a check on the supplies in the store , and prepare the chemicals for experiments . __eou__ What sort of student do you regard yourself as ? Did you enjoy studying while you were at school ? __eou__ I suppose I'm a reasonable student . I passed all my tests and enjoyed studying subjects that interested me . __eou__ What were your favorite subjects at school ? __eou__ Maths and chemistry were my favorite subjects at school . I also enjoyed history . __eou__ Do you have any plans for further study ? __eou__ Well , I've thought about doing the part-time Chemistry Certificate course at Technical College . I think I would really benefit from doing that . __eou__ Have you ever had a job before ? __eou__ Yes . I have worked part-time at a take away food store-the one just round the corner . __eou__ We have a lot of other applicants for this position . Why do you think that you deserve to get the job ? __eou__ Well , I've found out a lot about this type of work and my research suggests that I would be quite capable of doing the work involved . I also think that I would be able to handle any training course reasonably well . __eou__ I think I have asked you everything I wanted to . Thank you for coming along to the interview . __eou__ Thank you . When will I know if I am successful ? __eou__ We'll be in touch with you by telephone or by mail within a week . Well . Goodbye . __eou__ Goodbye . __eou__
Wow ! They've got everything here . All the world's famous brands . Aunt Cindy , what is your favorite brand ? __eou__ I love all the fashionable things . But my favorite brand is Chanel . __eou__ Oh , that's a very expensive brand , but with good reason . __eou__ Yeah . Each style is specially designed by world's top designers . So they can always make you look amazing . __eou__ I see . Come here . The high heels here look really attractive . But I wonder whether it's comfortable to wear any of them ? __eou__ Not really , especially at the beginning , if you wear high heels all day long , your feet would hurt . But , no big deal . Women can always get used to that . __eou__ It's not a simple thing to be beautiful . __eou__ Sure . But everyone loves to be beautiful . Hey , do you think this pair of sunglasses matches the handbag well ? __eou__ Yeah , very tasteful . And with them , you look even more fashionable . Oh , there are so many French perfumers . Oops , perfumes for guys ? So strange ! __eou__ Come on . Fashion is not only for women . Men also share the equal right to chase fashion . It's the new fashion for men to wear perfumes , which is called cologne . __eou__ Oh , really , that's really something new . I'm afraid not everyone can accept it . __eou__ It takes time for that . But people's consuming attitudes are changing quickly . __eou__ That's true . Well , it's obvious that fashion is not a cheap thing . So , do you spend all your money on it ? __eou__ No . Fashion is just part of my life , which improves its quality . But also , I'm good at financing . I have a credit card , but I never overdraft . __eou__ How is it that you are my mom's sis ? You two are so different . She always picks up bargains and spends more than she earns . You do so much better than her . __eou__ I have to say that's just the result of difference of our consumptive habits . __eou__
Hey Susan , what are you coming as this year ? __eou__ Coming as ? __eou__ Yeah ... for Halloween ! We have a big office party tomorrow evening . There's a prize for best costume ! __eou__ Um ... I have to confess , I haven't given it much thought . I'm from China and Halloween really isn't celebrated there . __eou__ Really ! You don't have some kind of Chinese ghost festival ? __eou__ Oh ... Sure . We have an entire month ! In traditional Chinese culture , Ghost Month is a period when the door between this world and beyond opens up and ghosts come back to earth for a visit . __eou__ Cool ! A whole month ! What do you do during that month ? __eou__ Well , people sometimes set off firecrackers , some people burn paper money as an offering and many people go to a temple to burn incense.Mainly though , you need to feed the ghosts because they're hungry . __eou__ Feed them ? __eou__ Yeah ... we set up tables with food , fruit and drinks and offer that to the hungry ghosts . __eou__ And then later everyone eats the food ? __eou__ Yes ! How did you guess that ? __eou__ It makes sense , right ? Who else is going to eat it ? __eou__ Good Point ! __eou__ But no dressing up like ghosts , right ? __eou__ No ! So ... is Halloween essentially the same thing as ghost month ? __eou__
Aunt Shirley , I heard the Yuan Miao Festival is the name for the festival . Why did it get its name ? __eou__ Well , the first lunar month is called Yuan-month , and in ancient times people called night Miao . And you know the festival is just in the middle of the month . __eou__ Oh , I see . I also heard today is the last day for the street fair . Can ’ t wait to sample all the snacks . __eou__ Sure . It ’ s indeed a culinary heaven which offers a wide range of delicious snacks to satisfy all tastes . Then , which one would you like ? __eou__ Can you recommend some must-try ? __eou__ OK . Let ’ s go over there . For the Lantern Festival , you should never omit the Yuanxiao . __eou__ What ’ s that ? It gets the name from the festival itself . That ’ s really funny ! __eou__ Actually , they are small dumpling balls made of glutinous rice flour . They are like Tangun . __eou__ Oh , I know Tangyuan . It ’ s a sweet snack , good for dessert . __eou__ Yes . And also , we can find Yuanxiao with both sweet and salty fillings . __eou__ I ’ d like to try the salty ones . Where does that strange smell come from ? __eou__ Oh , the smelly bean curd . My favorite ! __eou__
OK class , so today we are going to continue with our anatomy class , today we will review everything we have learned . Can anyone tell me what the first major organ is ? __eou__ The brain ! __eou__ That's right , the brain ! It serves as a control center for the body , handling the processes of the central nervous system as well as cognition . Then what major organ is in our chest ? __eou__ The heart ! __eou__ Very good ! It pumps blood throughout the body , using the circulatory system such as blood vessels and veins . Now let's not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive ! Now what about the organs that help us digest food ? __eou__ The stomach and intestines ! __eou__ Very good ! Let's not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food and our intestines process that food and then expel the waste . Are we forgetting anything ? __eou__ Yeah ! Our kidneys , liver and bladder ! __eou__ Oh yes , you are right . Very important organs indeed . __eou__ So what do these organs do , teacher ? __eou__ Well , mumm , they ... Time for a break ! We can talk about it when you get back . __eou__
Have you heard about Michael's new home ? It's in one of the poshest areas in this area . __eou__ Is he living in the new housing estate in Killington ? __eou__ No , he's living in an old house in Warton . __eou__ Do you mean the one near the health centre on Old Slate Road ? __eou__ That's the one . __eou__ His house must be worth millions ! That is one of the most beautiful areas in Oxford . The surrounding area is really peaceful , and getting into the city centre from there is very convenient . How can he afford that place ? __eou__ He didn't buy it . His grandfather died recently and left him loads of money . __eou__ Did he know that his grandfather was so wealthy ? __eou__ No one in the family expected to get a dime from him . It was quite a surprise . __eou__ What a lucky man . __eou__ He still has a complaint though . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ He wanted to live right on a bus line , but he doesn't . so , if he wants to take a bus anywhere , he has to walk 1/4 mile to get to a bus stop . __eou__ The poor thing . It must be difficult being him . __eou__ You can say that again . __eou__
Hello ? Ms . Patterson ? This is Bill from Workmate calling . I'm just wondering if you had a chance to look over the estimate I sent for your gala dinner project next month ... As I said in my email , we can help you with production according to your needs , but we will only be able to give insite management support services on a limited basis . __eou__ Oh , yes . I reviewed your estimate . But it seems like the project blueprint you sent with the estimate is not quite what we had in mind . Did you get a copy of the specs for this project ? __eou__ Yes , I have several copies , but they're all different versions ... The latest I have is version 12 , is that current ? __eou__ No . Later we decided to opt for the prior outline , version 7 . __eou__ Hold on , let me pull up your version 7 requirements ... Oh yes , no wonder our estimate is a little different from what you had in mind . I see the version 7 also includes 6 additional hostesses and a cocktail self-serve bar that wasn't in the version 12 . That will definitely add to your cost on this project ... __eou__
Donna ! How are you ? It's good to hear your voice . __eou__ Thank you . Jack , it's always a pleasure doing business with you . __eou__ So how are things in the land of the free and the home of brave ? __eou__ Great ! And , how are things in your neck of the woods ? __eou__ Things are so great here . I almost smiled myself to death last week . One of my coworkers had to give me CPR . __eou__ Oh.Jack , I have missed your sense of humor.Ha ha ha ! Nobody else sees things quite like you do.It ' s your gift . __eou__ Or a curse . __eou__ Nope , it's a gift.Anyway , we need some more of those mid-range speakers you tricked me into buying last time . __eou__ That , my dear , was classic sales technique delivered by a professional . __eou__ Are you still gouging your customers the same price per unit ? __eou__ Heck no , we doubled the price , but because it's you , I'll let you have'em at 50 off . __eou__ You silver-tongued devil . Can't you ever just answer a question with a simple yes or no ? __eou__ I could , but where's the fun in that ? __eou__
Nowadays , ships and boats are no longer so important in transportation as they used to be . __eou__ True . With the extension of railways and highways , and the improvement of safety and capacity of airplanes , ships and boats have been giving place to trains , planes and automobiles . __eou__ I read in the newspapers that the passenger liners from Shanghai to Ningpo and Dalian have been out of business ; and the liners up and down the Yangtze River have been reduced by 70 % . __eou__ The pace of life of people is now getting faster and faster , so the speed of ships and boats seems to be so slow . I think it may be the reason why people don't like to travel by boat . __eou__ But the most of the transoceanic cargo transportation is still carried by boat . __eou__
Post office offer lots of services nowadays , don ’ t they ? Years age , you only really used the post office to send mail , save money , and send or collect money . __eou__ Nowadays , they offer so many services , you hardly know which one to choose . Take mailing for example . Do you send something first class or second class or do you use EMS ? __eou__ I save money in a post office saving account . There used to be just one kind of account , but now there are several . They each have different conditions and interest rates . __eou__ You can buy things at post office that were never sold there before . You can buy sweets and chocolates , newspapers , birthday and Christmas cards ... __eou__ Post offices are still the place to go to collect welfare benefits , like unemployment benefit and child support benefit . The queue are very long on the days when people collect those payment . __eou__ My son likes going to the main post office . They have a philately counter where he can buy stamps for his collection . __eou__ Do you think that the service at post offices has improved ? __eou__ I think it ’ s better for some things , like sending and receiving money , but if you need to post something it sometimes takes longer than it used to . __eou__ I like being able to buy newspapers and magazines at the post office . It means that I don ’ t need to go to two places __eou__
Do you think discrimination against women in the work force is still prevalent even today ? __eou__ From my own experience as a career woman , I would have to say that while things are getting better now than they used to be , it is still a widespread problem . Society is changing , but there is still a glass ceiling for women in many career tracks . __eou__ do you think the glass ceiling phenomena is because of traditional social customs ? Or are there more issues coming into play ? __eou__ I think it's a very complicated issue . A part of the difficulties women have advancing in the work force are due to few opportunities and many male managers . Don't underestimate the good ole ' boy system . Men have power , so it's easier for them to stay in power . __eou__ What about affirmative action ? Hasn't legislation changed a lot of the make hierarchy ? __eou__ Affirmative action has given us management quotas and bans sexual discrimination , but it's still a man's world . __eou__
Are these your text books ? Biochemistry , General Ecology , Botany , Cell Genetics , Molecular Genetics ... __eou__ Yes . I gotta review all of them for the final exam . It is just around the corner . __eou__ Oh , right ! Do you have many exams at the end of each semester ? __eou__ That depends . Some semesters have many , some don't . And some courses don't have exams but only ask for papers . That's easy . __eou__ And when do you prepare for your final exam ? __eou__ Honestly speaking , most students prepare it one month before the exam . __eou__ Really ? You only review your lessons in one month ? Does it work ? __eou__ Of course , it's useful . And it's very crucial to have the copies of teacher's notes , because most questions in the exam are based on them . __eou__ Wow , and all the key points are included in them ? You're so smart ! __eou__ But the exam is not as simple as you may imagine . We have to stay up late . __eou__ Do you have the classrooms open for the whole night ? __eou__ Yes , some people even pack up his bed quilt and sleep there . That's a little bit crazy . __eou__
I've heard so much about Japan . Is it a beautiful country ? __eou__ Not everyone thinks Japan is beautiful , but to me its beauty is breathtaking.You feel the same way about France , don't you ? __eou__ Yes , I do feel the same way about France . The swift rivers , the fertile valleys , the large cities-its scenery is beautiful . Will you describe the geography of Japan ? __eou__ Well , it's made up of four large islands and many smaller islands located off the coast of the Asian main lands . France isn't an island , is it ? __eou__ Oh , no , France isn't an island . It is located in the western part of the European continent . But France does have many fine harbors and port cities on its southern and western coasts . Does Japan have good harbors ? __eou__ Good harbors ! Yokohama is one of the most famous port cities in the world , and Japan is the largest shipbuilding nation in the world . Also , there are long mountain ranges in the southern is hands . France isn't very mountainous , is it ? __eou__ No , France isn't very mountainous . But it does contain the Pyrenees , a large mountain range with high peaks and deep canyons . What kind of Climate does Japan have ? __eou__ The Japanese climate is warm and moist in the south , mild in the central part and cold in the north . Except for Hokkaido , we don't get much snowfall at all . France has a mild climate , doesn't it ? __eou__ Yes , the climate of France rarely has severe winters . In southern France , one can live in comfort the whole year . Is Japan good for farming ? __eou__ Yes , Japan is good for farming . Rice is the main crop , but Japan is also an industrial center . Fishing is very important , too . Rice isn't grown in France , is it ? __eou__ No , rice isn't grown in France . But farming , fishing and industry are also very important in France . I'd like to go to Japan some day . Would you like to visit France ? __eou__ Yes . I'd like to visit France . I'd like to travel all over the world . As you describe it , France seems to be very much like Japan . I would like to see it for myself . __eou__
Your resume mentioned that you had been the surveyor , which was a concurrent job , of a certain market survey company . What was your main work content ? __eou__ My main duties include designing survey sheets , transferring them to the dispatchers , making telephone covering on blurred information and processing the data and doing the primary analysis . __eou__ What had you gained mainly from this survey activity ? __eou__ First , it was how to design survey sheets according to the subjects , because we had to prevent the questions from being too influential and we must make sure that every question was balanced and equitable . Secondly , it was how to get information through telephone covering in the fastest and most effectively way , because the person doing the survey usually doesn ’ t have the patience to wait for long feedback . So the way we put up questions must be clear and direct and only by this means can we get accurate data . __eou__
We cannot avoid being asked questions in the interview . Sometimes , my mind goes blank . __eou__ It is so terrible to be caught unaware . __eou__ Admittedly , you can get prepared in advance for the interview , but you cannot cover everything concerned . __eou__ Sure . So you should know how to deal with the probable questions and then make flexible reply . __eou__ Firstly , your answer should go straight to the point , and be clear and brief . __eou__ State your opinion or argument first , and then go on with details . __eou__ Never should you give an answer completely beside the point . __eou__ If you indeed don't know how to answer , admit it frankly . __eou__ Pretending to know when you do not know may expose yourself to ridicule . __eou__ Confirm the question if you don't catch it clearly . __eou__ Try to avoid the possible duplicate answer if you can . __eou__ It can help you leave a deep impression on the interviewer . __eou__
Hey , Ben ... did you catch the game last night ? __eou__ Uh ... what game ? __eou__ Baltimore defeated Texas by 17 points ! __eou__ Um ... and what sport are we talking about here ? __eou__ Football of course ! __eou__ Oh ... football . Football is cool . I usually try to catch the World Cup finals . __eou__ No , I'm talking about American football . The World Cup is soccer . __eou__ Oh , I understand . I can't say I'm a big fan . I'm from China , and football doesn't have a really big following over there . __eou__ So Chinese people prefer soccer or basketball ? __eou__ Yes , I think so . But to be perfectly honest , I'm not really a sports nut.When I was in high school I played on the school volleyball team . Are you a diehard football fan ? __eou__ Oh , certainly . I wouldn't miss a game for the world . My girlfriend says I have an addiction . And actually , if I had to choose between her and my games ... I'd probably pick football . __eou__ It seems Americans are very passionate about sports . Is this just a part of your culture ? __eou__ Oh , yeah ! I think the love of sports starts when kids are very young . Americans come from many different backgrounds so I guess sports are something we can all enjoy together . __eou__
Hey , Mike . You've been surfing the Net for quite a while . What on earth are you searching for ? __eou__ It's something relative hackers . I often hear people talking about them , but I don't know much about them . __eou__ Well , roughly speaking , a hacker is a computer buff . __eou__ You mean a guy using enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the computer ? __eou__ You can say that . __eou__ But why are people always having such a negative attitude towards them ? __eou__ They must have mixed hackers with crackers . __eou__ What is crackers then ? __eou__ There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers , but they aren't . They break into computers and break the phone system . Real hackers call these people crackers , and want nothing to do with them . __eou__ So they are two totally different concepts . __eou__ Well , the real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy , irresponsible and not very bright , and feel that being able to break security does make you a hacker any more than being able to start cars without keys makes you an automotive engineer . Unfortunately , many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word hacker to describe crackers . This irritates real hackers to no end . __eou__ I see . Then the basic different is , hackers build things , crackers break them . __eou__ You got it . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__ You are welcome . __eou__
We've managed to reduce our energy consumption in our factory by about 15 per cent in the last two years . __eou__ That's excellent . How have you managed that ? __eou__ Mainly because we've invested in a heat recovery system . __eou__ What does that mean exactly ? __eou__ Well , we use the exhaust gases from our printing presses to provide energy to heat our dryers . __eou__ What other sources of energy do you use ? __eou__ We don't use any fossil fuels . Most of our power comes from hydro-electric plants . We're hoping to use even more energy from alternative sources in the future - perhaps even wind power . __eou__
What is your most preferred training method ? __eou__ Well , I prefer active rather than passive training . For example , I like the training offered by a financial software company from which we bought the newest updated virgin . They sent the programmers to demonstrate how to do and then ask us to practice . All employees receiving this training were in the same meeting room , so we could communicate with each other . We had a lot of fun learning together . It helps to build up the work relation among colleagues . __eou__ Well , that is also very efficient , right ? __eou__ Of course , it is much better than just giving us some reading materials or information via the internet . __eou__ That ’ s boring . Once we were asked to watch a video on how to operate the punches , all of us seemed to fall into sleep by the end of the video . __eou__
Now people are talking about world recession which started more than a year ago . Can you give us your personal assessment of the situation of the global economy ? __eou__ As you know , we are in a very special time . This is a very hard time for many countries ' economics , both developed and developing . I think the current economic situation could be described as synchronized slowdown of major economies . __eou__ What is the direct impact of the terrorist attack upon your country's economy ? __eou__ Once the US economy is in trouble due to the terrorist attack , the impact could be quickly felt in the rest of the world . __eou__ What challenges is your country's economy facing at the moment ? __eou__ We do face a lot of challenges because there is still much uncertainty about the world economy . It's very important for us to strike a proper balance between investment in fixed assets and household consumption . __eou__
Bill , I'm expecting a big increase in turnover with the coming of the Mid-Autumn Festival . But wholesales are unwilling to supply my orders unless I pay them an advance of 50 % of the full price , for my business is fairly new . I hope that you can make me an advance on loan . __eou__ Do you have stocks or a title deed of a house to pledge as security ? __eou__ No . I should be grateful if you could see your way to make an advance against my personal reputation . You may inspect my accounts . From my accounts you can see that I've promptly met all my obligations . __eou__ We do not allow any request for a loan against personal security . This is a common regulation . But we may consider it if you can provide a reliable guarantor . __eou__ Yes , I can . You know Mr . Macready , the famous car dealer here in New York . He agreed to act as my guarantor of a loan in the sum of US $ l0 , 000 until the end of this year . __eou__ Good . He is a man of high standing . I think we can grant the loan you need after some further discussion . But I suggest you borrow on overdraft instead of on loan . __eou__
Hey , Jordan , is that you ? Long time no see ! __eou__ Oh , hey , no kidding ! I haven't seen you since orientation three months ago ! So how've you been ? Settling into college life OK ? __eou__ Yeah , I think so ! I pledged Phi Iota Alpha , so I'm living at the frat house now . __eou__ Oh , so you're a frat boy now , huh ? __eou__ Yeah , yeah , I know , it's totally cliche , but really , I think it's been a good decision . I've got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys . What about you ? What have you been up to ? __eou__ Not much . I'm still living at home and commuting to school . I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about . It just wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped . The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count . __eou__ That sounds smart ... but kind of boring . __eou__ Yeah , it is , a little bit . I joined the Great Outdoors Club , though , which has been a lot of fun . We've gone on two camping trips already , and I've made some good friends . __eou__ That's cool . Hey , so have you decided on your major yet ? __eou__ Definitely pre-med . What about you ? __eou__ I still have no clue ... but we don't have to declare a major till our sophomore year , so I've got time ! Oops , I'm late for class . Gotta run ! __eou__ OK , take care ! Hey , nice running into you ! __eou__ Yeah , you too ! __eou__
How did you get around over there ? Did you rent cars ? __eou__ No , that would be too expensive . We used the train system.We bought a special pass called a Enrail pass . It lets people use the train wherever they want , as often as they want . __eou__ I've heard about Enrail passes.So those Europeans really depend on trains a lot . __eou__ Yes , they do . I wish we Americans had a better train system . __eou__ I know . Our train system is lousy.And besides , Americans love their cars too much . __eou__ I agree . And probably the automobile companies are too powerful.They never allowed the government to develop trains . __eou__ It's too bad for the environment . So much pollution from cars . __eou__ Americans love cars for different reasons , I think.One reason is that we are very individualistic.And cars are a very individual way of getting around.Americans like the freedom of driving around by themselves.They don't want to ride in a train or bus with a group of people . __eou__ Yes , I agree . I think it is a cultural characteristic.It would be very hard to get us Americans to change this.But you know what ? Probably , in the future , Americans will have to change . __eou__ Why do you say " have to " ? __eou__ Because the earth's environment can't tolerate cars forever . I think cars are already causing global warming.When the problem gets more serious , world governments will have to start limiting car use . __eou__ Maybe you're right . They will have to develop alternative transportation.But it will be hard in America . Too many people are used to cars.Even in our movies cars are very important . __eou__ Wow ! I didn't notice the time.It ' s almost noon . I have to get home . __eou__ Do you want me to give you a ride ? __eou__ No , no problem . I have my car in the parking ramp around the corner . __eou__ Alright.Well , I'll stay here and have another coffee . Nice running into you . __eou__ See you around . __eou__
How are you feeling , Flora ? __eou__ Much better , thanks . I have been resting all day . Only with television as my companion.In fact , in the whole week the only thing I feel like doing was watching TV . __eou__ What did you watch today ? __eou__ I started with game show this morning , I really enjoy them , and even answered the most of questions correctly . __eou__ And next ? __eou__ At 2 o'clock , I switched to the Channel 6 , and watched a terrific movie without commercials . __eou__ I know what you mean , there wasn't old action movie next . I think you won't like it . __eou__ I want to watch it , but I was already tired by the time it came on . I had a rest instead , then I watched the news at Channel 11 . __eou__ Anything important happened ? __eou__ A bank was robbed this afternoon . A reporter on the scene covered the event , the live coverage reproduce the robbery to the live . __eou__
Have you got any experience in advertising ? __eou__ Yes , I have been working in the Public Relations Section of a company in the past two years . I plan the advertising campaign and cooperate the work of artists and typographers . Sometimes I have to do the work of a specialist when there ’ s something urgent . __eou__ Do you have any practical experience as a secretary ? __eou__ Yes , sir . I acted as a secretary in an insurance company . __eou__ Would you tell me the essential qualities a secretary should maintain ? __eou__ Well , to begin with , I would say she needs to be diligent , and the second point is that she has to do a lot of things on her own initiative . Finally , she can make notes in shorthand and types and has the skills in report writing , summary writing , keep minutes at meetings , and so on . Most important of all is that she seems to have a better memory than average . __eou__ Have you had any experience with computer ? __eou__ Yes , I studied in a computer training program , and can process data through the computer . __eou__ That's fine . What about operating the fax and duplicator ? __eou__ I can handle them without any trouble __eou__ What have you learned from jobs you have held ? __eou__ Above all , I have learned that what is good for the company is good for me . So I follow the instructions strictly and always keep my boss informed . __eou__ Very good . __eou__
What's your main range ? __eou__ Generally speaking , we provide bikes for both gentlemen and ladies , size 19 , 21 , 23 , 25 and 27 inches . We can vary the colors according to the buyer's requirements . Here are the catalogues and the pattern books . They will give you a rough idea about our products . __eou__ I am interested in your flying pigeon bicycles . I think some of these items will find a ready market in Canada . But what our customers appreciate most is a reliable product . __eou__ To be reliable is the strong point of our products . As a matter of fact , it's always our practice to supply high quality goods at reasonable prices . Flying pigeon is the best of its kind at the price . __eou__ Then I'd like to know your availability of the products and the terms of sales , such as mode of payment , delivery , discounts , etc . __eou__
Have you seen the movie Batwoman ? __eou__ No , not yet . Is it good ? __eou__ Yes , it's quite amusing , actually . Good plot , and Sharon Stone's in it . __eou__ Oh , she's good . She must be getting on a bit now . __eou__ Yeah , but she looks amazing . __eou__ So what's the movie about ? __eou__ Well , it's about this woman who got murdered because she discovered some company secrets about the cosmetics company she worked for . But then she got reincarnated as a cat . __eou__ Huh ? __eou__ I know . Stay with me . She then decided to get her revenge by revealing the company secret and killing the boss . First , though , she had to discover her true cat nature . At the end she had a big fight with Sharon Stone , who was the real danger in the company . She had actually murdered the boss , who was her husband , and then tried to frame Batwoman for the murder , so everyone thought Batwoman was evil . __eou__ I see . Batwoman married the boss ? __eou__ No . Sharon Stone was married to the boss , who treated her badly , so she killed him . So where was I ? OK , so then , at the same time she fell in love with a cop , who was investigating the murder of the boss . Finally , she ditched the cop to follow her feline nature . __eou__ Wait a minute , I'm lost . The cop killed the boss ? __eou__ No , Sharon Stone did . __eou__ And Sharon Stone is Batwoman ? __eou__ Haven't you been listening to a word I've been saying ? __eou__
How much do you have budgeted for our trip to Las Angeles ? __eou__ In total , it should be about $ 5,000 for the week conference . Would you like to see the breakdown ? __eou__ Yes , I want to know exactly where the money is going . Give me a detailed report . __eou__ First we have the airline tickets , which are $ 500 per person ; with four of us going , that's t $ 2,000 . For our accommodations , we're spending $ 80 a night , per room , for five days . That's another $ 800 . __eou__ Weren ’ t you able to find anything less expensive ? We're sharing rooms , right ? __eou__ I have two people to a room . The $ 80 room rate is the lowest I could find . With the conference going on that week , all the hotels have inflated their prices , they're making a killing . __eou__ So far we have $ 2,800 , what else ? __eou__ I have budget $ 25 per Peron per day for food expenses . That totals another $ 800 . And for other incidentals , like take fees , and tips , I have estimated about $ 400 . __eou__ Well , that's only $ 4000 . Didn't you tell me your budget was $ 5000 ? Where is the rest of the money ? __eou__ That's my buffer ... I wanted to leave a little room in the budget , just in case---it's better to be safe than sorry . __eou__
hey , the new SOHO . How's everything going ? __eou__ everything's great . I've just returned from my office . __eou__ your office ? Aren't you a freelancer ? __eou__ sure I am . I work for myself , but I've rented a virtual office at an office building in the downtown area . __eou__ a virtual office ? __eou__ yeah , an office that runs efficiently by using nothing other than online communication technologies . I pay the rent and share office services with others in the same building . __eou__ what kind of services do they offer ? __eou__ a separated office , internet access , phone services , fax services , mail & courier services , and almost everything you have in a conventional office . __eou__ sounds fun.what else ? __eou__ I get a business address at an expensive location , and I can share the receptionist and secretary with other offices in the same floor . __eou__ oh , that helps a lot to promote your corporate image . __eou__ you bet it ! __eou__
I hate to be the bearer of bad news , but it's that time of year again . Have you got your performance evaluations finished yet ? __eou__ Oh no ! Evaluations ! You can tell that's not my favorite job ; I haven't even started yet . When is the deadline for turning in thecompleted forms ? __eou__ Well , you do still have three weeks . But remember the employee must sign them , too . Filling them in is nothing - it's meetingwith the employees that takes so much time . __eou__ I never know how to rate the employees ' work . Of course attendance and productivity are easy , I just look at the sales figures . __eou__ So it's the subjective criteria like team building and colleague support that you find hard ? __eou__ Exactly ! Attitude ... how do you rate attitude ? __eou__ I suggest letting each employee fill out his or her own evaluation for those items . Then , based on their self - assessment , you can add your comments . It's a great starting point for discussion __eou__ Great idea . And after all , that's the whole point of an evaluation . I almost can't wait to give it a try . __eou__
I can't believe my eyes , Bill . Are you having a salad for lunch ? No hamburger ? __eou__ Get used to it , Mary . I'm off hamburgers for good health . Most fast food is loaded with sodium . __eou__ I know . But why are you suddenly interested in lessening your salt intake ? __eou__ My doctor says I should cut back on sodium-rich foods to lower my blood pressure . __eou__ Do you have hypertension ? I would have thought you were too young . __eou__ Actually , my blood pressure isn't that high yet , but they say it increases with age . __eou__ Well , I'm glad you're starting to pay more attention to your diet . __eou__ I want to lower my risk of heart attack and stroke , too . __eou__ So do I . That's why I've been trying to lower my cholesterol level . __eou__ I've noticed you've been munching away on lots of fruits and vegetables recently . __eou__ That's right . I could stand to lose a few pounds , too . __eou__
How did you choose courses when you were abroad ? __eou__ That's a very good question . Choosing proper courses and effectively planning a college schedule is very important to the progress toward your educational goal . In order to do these wisely and effectively , you should consult with a Program Adviser or Academic Counselor . __eou__ Wait a minute . There are some new terms for me . I can hardly follow you . __eou__ Ok , I will go into more detail . A Program Adviser or an Academic Counselor is usually an experienced professor who is responsible for all the necessary academic counseling through graduation . You can discuss with him the program selection , changing or adding a program , the requirements for graduation , and other problems related to your study . You will choose some courses , and then discuss with the adviser whether your choice can meet the requirements for graduation . __eou__ Everything is so new to me . I think I'll have to experience a very difficult period when I get there . __eou__ Sure , very difficult . __eou__ I am very grateful for your advice . __eou__ It's my pleasure to talk with you . __eou__
I ’ m so excited about Chinese New Year ! When do I get to visit Grandma ? Grandma makes the best dumplings in the world ! __eou__ Ha ha , right . Sounds to me like you ’ re more excited about the dumplings than seeing your Grandma . __eou__ Of course I miss Grandma , too . I bet she ’ s gonna teach me how to play Mahjong ! Hey , Dad , are you going to buy me firecrackers this year ? We ’ re going to have the best fireworks ! I ’ m really looking forward to lighting them ! __eou__ Son , firecrackers aren ’ t toys.they ’ re dangerous ! __eou__ No , fireworks are awesome ! __eou__ Whoa , don ’ t you remember ? Last year when I set off the firecrackers , you covered both your ears and hid behind your mother ? __eou__ I was scared because ... because I saw a bug . That ’ s all . __eou__ Ahahah ... really ? __eou__ Oh , and I can ’ t wait to watch the dragon dance ! Dad , can I sit on your shoulders this time ? __eou__ Hey , I offered last year ... __eou__ Well , I ... anyways , I was just thinking of the red envelopes . I wanna make a list of all the things I ’ m gonna buy with my red envelope money ! I can ’ t wait ! I ’ m gonna have so much money ! Mom , can I get a pen and a piece of paper ? I want a new transformer , no , two transformers ... the Optimums Prime , and ... maybe the wheeljack ? I ’ ll get a PSP game , ahahah , and I ’ ll buy the entire class lunch at MacDonald ’ s ... __eou__
You didn't tell me she was married ! __eou__ I tried . You were preoccupied . __eou__ I got carried away . I made such a fool of myself . They were both laughing at me ! __eou__ You got drunk , and you were hilarious . Lighten up . __eou__ That guy was definitely a Don . __eou__ So now you can say you had a mafia experience . Ha-ha . __eou__ Yeah . If I leave Little Italy alive ... __eou__ Are you kidding ? Don had fun scaring you . He'd probably buy you dinner if we go back . __eou__
How's your time spent in the United States ? __eou__ Well , pretty good . __eou__ I'm glad to hear that . What impressed you most ? __eou__ Well , the cultural differences impressed me most . __eou__ You mean we Chinese think differently from the Americans ? __eou__ That's right , quite different . One day one of my American friend looked pale , so I asked him whether he was sick or not . But he was reluctant to answer my question . __eou__ That's weird . __eou__ And what's more , when he told me he had caught a cold for several days , I suggested him to go to the hospital as soon as possible . __eou__ You really cared about your friend . __eou__ Sure I am . But he responded by saying'what do you mean ? ' . __eou__ I'm confused . Why did he say that ? __eou__ I felt the same at first . Later he told me that I'd better not give him any suggestions when he was sick . Offering unsolicited help or advice is like showing sympathy to the weak or the poor . But back in China , helping others is always regarded being kind . __eou__ Absolutely . Now I understand why he responded that way . __eou__
Do you have a copy of today ’ s newspaper ? I want to check the results from the world athletics championship . __eou__ Yes , I ‘ m just reading them myself . It ’ s been a great competition . We got gold medals in three events . __eou__ Yes , we won the men ’ s 110 metres hurdles . I watched that on TV . What other events did we win ? __eou__ We won the men ’ s high jump and the women ’ s 1500 meters . __eou__ That ’ s great . Those athletes must train for years to get into peak physical condition . They must be terribly disappointed if they don ’ t win . __eou__ The woman who won the 1500 meters also broke the world record by 2 seconds . __eou__ That ’ s amazing ! Were any other records broken ? __eou__ A Russian man broke the discus record by a centimeters . Out best athlete broke his personal best in the long jump , but it only got him third place . __eou__ Did you see the final of the men ’ s 100 metres ? It was very exciting . One competitor made two false starts . __eou__ Was he disqualified ? __eou__ Yes , he was . I imagine he must be very angry with himself for that . __eou__
Doctor , save my baby , please __eou__ What symptoms does he have ? __eou__ He has had a fever for one day . Just now at home , he had febrile convulsions with teeth and fists clenched and eyes turned up . We were at a loss what to do . We called an ambulance and brought the baby here . __eou__ How long did the convulsion last ? __eou__ About 3 minutes . __eou__ Does he have any other complaints ? __eou__ Three days ago , he began to cough , sneeze and have a running nose . Yesterday , he began to have a fever . __eou__ Have you taken his temperature ? __eou__ It was 38 ° C this morning and it was 39 ° C just now . __eou__ Let me examine him to see if there is any rash . No rash . __eou__ Is it serious ? Is it meningitis ? __eou__ No , it is not meningitis . Just a high fever and convulsions , which results from a virus upper respiratory tract inflection . __eou__ Does he have to be admitted to hospital ? __eou__ No . No need for admission . I'll give the baby analgia nose drops to bring down the temperature first . Then I will give you a prescription . The pink tablets are used for his fever . When his temperature is over 38 ° C , give him one tablet . The other tablets are sedatives for his convulsions . The white liquid is for the cold . Give the baby plenty of water to drink . __eou__ Thank you very much , doctor . __eou__
Good evening , sir . I understand that you have been robbed . __eou__ I certainly have . __eou__ When did this happen ? __eou__ About two hours ago . __eou__ Why didn't you report it before ? __eou__ I couldn't . I was bound and gagged . __eou__ Please tell me exactly what happened . __eou__ I was sitting in this room watching television when someone knocked on the door . Without thinking , I opened it . __eou__ That wasn't very wise , sir . __eou__ I know . I was expecting my wife , you see , and thought it was her . __eou__ You should never open a door without looking to see who it is . __eou__ Yes , I know . I regret it very much . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ Two men pushed into the flat . One of them threatened me with a knife while the other bound and gagged me . __eou__ Did you get a good look at them ? __eou__ I'm afraid not . They were both wearing stockings over their faces . __eou__ What did they take ? __eou__ My wallet , with $ 200 in it , my wrist watch.some of my wife's jewellery from our bedroom , and a silver photoframe . __eou__ They don't seem to have done much damage to the flat . __eou__ No . They had just begun to search when the dogs next door began to bark . Theran off then leaving me bound and gagged . It was some time before my wifereturned and released me . I phoned the police at o __eou__ My men began searching the area as soon as we received your call . I can't promise you that we'll recover your property but we'll certainly do our best . __eou__
Well , we've finally put the finishing touches on the training programs for next year . Here's a report showing the projected costs as well as the expected return on investment . __eou__ Return on investment ? How can you have a return on this kind of investment ? Can you really calculate the value of these training programs ? __eou__ Sure ! It's not a real figure , of course . It's just an estimate based on rehiring costs , and the potential lost revenue that results from incompetence . __eou__ Wow ! I'm impressed . So , what's in the cards for future training ? Will it be in-house or off-site ? __eou__ A little of both . We'll have a few daylong sessions for things like business writing skills and software training . Those are available to everyone . We also have a variety of other programs __eou__ Yes , I see that here ... continuing education for the IT department , a time management course for accounting , and team building for sales . Anything planned for HR ? __eou__ A holiday , I hope ! No , really , we are looking into some courses on motivational techniques . We'll add them to the list when we choose a lecturer . __eou__
Wake up , Erik , time to rise and shine . __eou__ Huh , oh , hi , Jane . I must have fallen asleep while I was reading . __eou__ You and everyone else . It looks more like a camp-ground than a library . __eou__ Well , the dorm ’ s too noisy to study in , and I guess this place is too quiet . __eou__ Have you had any luck finding a topic for your paper ? __eou__ No . Prof . Grant told us to write about anything in cultural anthropology . For once I wish she hadn ’ t given us so much of a choice . __eou__ Well , why not write about the ancient civilizations of Mexico . You seem to be interested in that part of the world . __eou__ I am , but there is too much material to cover . I ’ ll be writing forever , and Grant only wants five to seven pages . __eou__ So they limit it to one region of Mexico . Say the Yucatan . You ’ Ve been there and you said it ’ s got lots of interesting relics . __eou__ That ’ s not a bad idea . I brought many plenty of books and things back with me last summer . That would be great resource material . Now if I can only remember where I put them . __eou__
There are advertisements everywhere here in hong kong . The city is so bright at night , with all the neon signs . __eou__ I like it . It makes the city feel alive . I like all the different colors and I like the billboards with eye-catching pictures and slogans . __eou__ I think that there are too many of them . I think that companies spend far too much money on advertising . They should have lower prices instead . Then they would see more . __eou__ I see your point , but if companies didn ’ t spend money on advertising , no one would hear about their products . I agree that some form of advertising can be annoying . I don ’ t like it when people try to give you leaflets with information about products you have no intention of buying . __eou__ I really hate receiving spam . I also dislike having to listen to advertisements and jingles when they are broadcast in stores or on the subway . __eou__ Yes , that annoys me too . With billboards , you can look away , but with broadcasts , you can ’ t avoid them . I like the way that advertising agencies use comedy in their campaign . __eou__ I like that too . I don ’ t like the way that advertising campaign often tell you if you don ’ t buy a certain product , you ’ re not cool or modern or efficient or something . __eou__ That kind of advertising seems to be very common with brand name products . They are always trying to maintain brand loyalty . __eou__
What separates your product from the competition ? __eou__ Our product features inventory tracking software , which continuously updates and tracks your inventory on a real-time basis . __eou__ Is the software user-friendly ? __eou__ Yes it is very easy to use and each system installation comes with a 3 - day employee training seminar . __eou__ Is this training part of the package or will it cost extra ? __eou__ Our quoted price includes the software system , installation , 3 day training seminar and ongoing troubleshooting.There are no hidden costs . __eou__
Come and meet our employees , Mr . Richards . __eou__ Thank you , Mr . Jackson . __eou__ This is Nicola Grey , and this is Claire Taylor . __eou__ How do you do ? Those women are very hard-working . What are their jobs ? __eou__ They ’ re keyboard operators . This is Michael Baker , and this is Jeremy Short . __eou__ How do you do ? They aren ’ t very busy ! What are their jobs ? __eou__ They ’ re sales reps . They are very lazy . __eou__ Who is this young man ? __eou__ This is Jim . He is our office assistant . __eou__
Where's Bill ? The ambassador is already here . The meeting is set to start at 9 am . __eou__ He's late again . Traffic is probably holding him up . You know , he commutes from the suburbs . It's not easy commuting every day . We should cut him some slack . __eou__ Even though the traffic is bumper-to-bumper out there , I don't think it's heavy traffic that makes Bill late . He takes the train , remember ? __eou__ Oh , that's right . Well , the train shouldn't be late . That means there is only one explanation ... Bill must have overslept . __eou__ Well , to be fare , since he's coming all the way from Lancaster , he's got to get up much earlier than the rest of us . He must get start on his commute about six thirty , no telling what time he actually gets up . __eou__ That's right , because he's got to get to the train station from his house , then take the blue line into the city , then switch trains to the red line . In all , the trip's got to take more than 2 hours . __eou__ Why doesn't he just drive to work ? __eou__ It's too difficult to park your car in the city . Also , the traffic coming in from the suburbs is a nightmare . __eou__
What are you doing , Janice ? __eou__ I am reading the book on patent and I think it will be helpful for my work __eou__ Patent ? Are you also learning something about patent ? __eou__ Yep ! I heard that your company is registering a new trademark . __eou__ You are well-informed . Can you tell me something about the Patent Law in our country from the book you are reading ? __eou__ I just read this in the whole afternoon . Let me show you . __eou__ So coincidental . Actually we can exchange some information on this problem . __eou__ The purpose of the law is to protect and encourage inventions and to promote the development of science and technology . The law came into effect in 1984 , and it consists of 8 chapters with 69 articles . __eou__ Is there any provision on applying for the patent for foreign company ? __eou__ Foreign companies should appoint a patent agency , which is designated by our government to act as his patent agent . This task is usually taken by the Patent Agent Department . __eou__ How long is the duration of patent right for an invention according to your Patent Law ? __eou__ 15 years . __eou__
I call this meeting to order . Thank you all in attendance today , I know it's a busy day for you all . We have a lot of material to cover today . Did everyone get an agenda ? __eou__ I need a copy of the agenda . Also , may I suggest something ? I know we have many points to review today , but would it be possible to limit our meeting time to finish before four o'clock ? Many of us still have a mountain of work to do before the day's end . __eou__ We should be able to finish everything up before then . Let's run through the major points first , and see where we're at . The first matter of business is to approve the minutes of our last meeting . __eou__ I propose we accept the minutes . __eou__ Good . Do I have a second ? __eou__ I second . __eou__ motion carried . Now , next on our agenda is our budget review . Margaret , can you please fill us in on where the budget review stands ? __eou__ I gave everyone a copy of the manual last week . We've had the review board going over everything , and they have come up with a final review . Here's a copy for everyone , and if you have any questions , you can talk to me after the meeting . Basically , the budget review has been completed , with maybe a few polishing details left . __eou__ What kind of action is required ? __eou__ If everyone could take a look at the final review handout , if there're any objections or corrections , let me know . Next week , we can cast the final approval . __eou__
What can I do for you , sir ? __eou__ I'd like to choose one game for myself and one for my younger sister . __eou__ What kind of games do you like ? __eou__ Big games of course . __eou__ I see , but games are played in different ways . I'm wondering what type of games do you like to play ? __eou__ Type ? I don't know , what do you have ? __eou__ Basically , there are 7 types of games __eou__ Well , I am a beginner . I ... __eou__ Don't worry . Most male customers choose first person shooting , real time strategy , action or sports , while female customers prefer simulating , action or role playing . Shooting , action and sports games require flexible movements and real time strategy usually needs overall consideration . __eou__ I like first person shooting and action more than other types of games . __eou__ If so , counter Strike and Might & Magic are good alternatives . Counter Strike is one of the hottest shooting games and Might & Magic series are popular among girls because the game has attractive plot and interesting scenes . __eou__ Oh , thanks a lot . Then , I will take the two . __eou__ Do you want the latest editions ? If your computer runs fast , I think the latest editions are better because although old editions are cheaper , they are less exciting and attractive . __eou__ I will have the latest editions . __eou__
Morning , Tom ! What are you doing over there ? Learning to dance ? __eou__ Can't you see ? I'm practicing tai chi ! __eou__ Oh , my goodness . I'm sorry . But I don't think tai chi is to be practiced like that . __eou__ I'm just a beginner . Did my poses make me the butt of jokes ? __eou__ Well , they just look a bit funny . but far from making a laughing stock out of you . __eou__ So , is there anything wrong with my strokes ? __eou__ To begin with , you should keep your neck erect upward at any time . __eou__ Like this ? __eou__ Good ! And then , the entire body . Never incline your body forward or backward . Take care to regulate the point of balance . Place it at your waist . __eou__ Did I do it right ? __eou__ No ! You should avoid sticking out your belly . Keep your hip steady . Don't swing . __eou__ What should I do with my legs then ? __eou__ Oh , yes , things are quite different with the limbs . Keep your knees bent a little . Right , they should be rich in elasticity . Move slowly when you shift your centre of gravity from one leg to another . __eou__ Fantastic ! I guess the same is true with the arms , right ? __eou__ Exactly ! Move your arms in a relaxed manner . Well . don't stretch yourfingers stiffly . Just keep them in a natural shape . __eou__
Earning extra income on the Internet is easier than you might think . After I started selling traditional craft items on the Internet last year , I have really been able to make bank doing something I love . __eou__ Is that right ? I hear all these horror stories of internet business crashing because there is not enough of a customer base yet . How can you be sure your idea will cash in ? __eou__ To run a successful internet business , it requires a little research and relatively small investment . You've got to have a good idea of some kind of product that is in demand or would be popular . __eou__ That's marketing research ... But what about getting started once you have an idea ? __eou__ After you have your great idea , then you can set up shop by registering a domain name , creating a website , an email address , and a hosting service . If you want to go all out on your website , you can put together shopping cart technology , but that can be pricey to start out with . __eou__ Sounds like a lot of work ! __eou__ Anything worth doing takes work . Money doesn't grow on trees ... Most of us have to work for it . __eou__
Let's start the interview with some questions . Tell me about yourself and your past experience . __eou__ I have 10 years financial industry experience , working for several companies . For the past two years , I have been working in an investment banking . In addition to my analytical mindset , I have a background of solid accounting principles . I am a team player and have great communication and interpersonal skills . I thrive on challenge and work well in high-stress environments . __eou__ What finance experience have you had that qualifies you for this position ? __eou__ My background and experience include working on a variety of projects and jobs in the financial industry . Most of my experience has been behind the scenes , doing the calculations . I want to work with clients and continue to grow and be challenged . __eou__ Why did you leave your last position ? __eou__ I'm not finding the work as challenging as I used to . I want to find a job that is stimulating , where I can grow . __eou__ What are your strengths and weaknesses ? __eou__ One of my strengths is my ability to be flexible . I've seen companies go through many changes in structure and management philosophy . I've had to adjust my style to the new environment several times . As far as weaknesses , I really enjoy my work , and sometimes I put in too much time . But by being aware of my tendency to overwork , I have learned to pace myself more and work less overtime . __eou__ How would your boss describe you and your work style ? __eou__ She'd say I have a lot of initiative , I see the big picture and I do what has to be done . Second , I always meet deadlines . If I say I'm going to do something , I do it . Lastly , I have the ability to focus on what I'm working on I am not easily distracted . __eou__ What are your salary expectations ? __eou__ I'm sure whatever you offer will be a fair amount for a person with my qualifications . Salary is not the most important factor to me . I'm looking for opportunity . __eou__ Do you have any questions ? __eou__ Yes , I do . What do you see as the future trends for the industry ? __eou__
Tell me something about yourself and your past experience . __eou__ I have eight years of experience working in the IT industry . For the past two years , I have been working as a project manager for a dotcom . I am also MI certified . I'm looking for a team environment where I can join the excitement of building a company . __eou__ What experience have you had that qualifies you for this position ? __eou__ I have worked on a variety of projects and jobs in the high tech industry . I wanted to have the experience of working for a dotcom and have learned something about being in on the ground floor of a business . __eou__ What attracted you to this job ? __eou__ I've been searching for a while now to find a company that had a business model and corporate philosophy like yours . I am interested in working for a company that provides products and services to the K - 12 education market . My background is in this field , and my strength is in building relationships and solving problems . I am excited and interested in the idea of developing business relationships through e-commerce . __eou__ What qualities do you think are important to this position ? __eou__ To have a combination of technical and business knowledge and to be very results-oriented . My past record shows that I have those qualities and more . Because of my business acumen and technical know-how , the teams I have managed accomplished outstanding results , including booking more than $ 50 million in online revenue . __eou__ When have you been most motivated ? __eou__ When I have a specific project to complete , I like to know the specifics of a project from beginning to end . I like definite deadlines and I like to meet those deadlines . I expect some deviation from the original plan , but I try to stay focused and not let myself drift too far . I have great attention to detail and like to take my time and do it right the first time . __eou__ Why did you leave your last position ? __eou__ I've set some goals for myself and my career , and unfortunately I'm at a standstill in my current situation . I have begun to explore options available before I spend too much time in a job where I can't advance . My goal is to continue to take on new responsibilities and be a key contributor to the success of an online venture . __eou__ What are your salary expectations ? __eou__ I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . I'd like to postpone that discussion until later . __eou__ Do you have any questions ? __eou__ Yes , I do . Who are your financial backers ? Who are the key competitors ? Does the company have a plan for the IPO ? What would you say is the best thing about your product or service ? __eou__
Are the galaxies in the universe moving through space ? __eou__ No , the galaxies sit more or less passively in the space around them . But not too much . As the space between galaxies expands , it carries the galaxies further apart - like raisins in an expanding dough . __eou__ But I heard that our Milky way galaxy may one day collide with a neighboring galaxy . If galaxies are moving apart from each other , how can they collide ? __eou__ Well , the universe is a chaotic place , and the gravity from one galaxy , or from a group of galaxies , may disturb the motion of its near neighbors , causing them to collide . However , on average , when you compare two large enough chunks of space , the galaxies in one are moving away from the galaxies in the other . __eou__ Wow , you're really informative . Thanks a lot . __eou__ You're welcome . __eou__
Even if our company didn't have a dress code , I still think people would wear formal clothing to work . __eou__ I wouldn't be so sure ... People want to wear what they feel most comfortable in . __eou__ Maybe that's true for some positions , but I think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree . They dress for success ! You can't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans . It's just not respectful to you client . __eou__ I think what you wear is so overrated . I would rather have a down-to-earth , honest and solid sales person than a painted , patent leather , designer suite salesman . __eou__ It's not as simple as that . People judge you by your appearance , whether you like it or not . So dressing professional is being professional . The image that you portray to others is so important in business . It's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale . __eou__ Maybe you're right , but I'll take my sneakers and jeans any day ! __eou__
So how did you meet Bill ? __eou__ I met him through a computer bulletin board . __eou__ Oh , really ? Which bulletin board ? __eou__ It was one I used down at the local coffee house called the San Francisco Net . It's been around since around 1991 . __eou__ I've heard about that , but I've never tried it . __eou__ You ought to . One dollar buys you 15 minutes of computer time . A Chat session links you with cappuccino sippers in other cafes and also to home computers on the network . __eou__ I have no desire to talk on a network with a bunch of strangers . __eou__ That's the whole point . All your inhibitions disappear because you can ’ t see the other person . This network allows you to talk to people whom you normally wouldn ’ t talk to . __eou__ I just want a private conversation with one other person . __eou__ You can do that . A private session lets two people talk alone . This techno-chat program lets you talk about anything with everybody , without prejudice because you can ’ t see them . __eou__ Well , maybe I'll tag along and watch how you talk . __eou__ That's fine with me , but we'll have to get there early . Because after 8 pm , there is always a long line . __eou__ It ’ s that popular ? __eou__ It sure is . __eou__
Did you read the news that ' China's property prices rose at the fastest pace in 18 months in December , ending the year with rising fears of bubbles in the property market ' ? __eou__ No . Does the newspaper say what has caused that ? __eou__ Yes . It says the hike was a result of purchase rush in the fourth quarter on expectations of tightening politics . __eou__ I think the government should make a serves of moves to cool the market . __eou__ Right . The climbing property prices has become a headache for Chinese residents . __eou__
What kind of promotional events are scheduled for the new product line ? __eou__ Marketing has us set up with product launches in five major cities , as well as some sponsoring events throughout the year . All together , there will be 15 events . __eou__ What kind of sponsoring are we talking about ? I don't know how effective sponsorship really is ... __eou__ It's not what you're thinking . These events will give us a wider exposure than most . Take the tri-city marathon for starters . This is a highly publicized event . The television exposure alone will nearly double our customer awareness . __eou__ Other than the marathon , what else is on the list ? __eou__ We've got a spot in Olympic Stadium sponsoring one of a team's equipment , then a rally for cancer research , and a connection to the inner-city education program . __eou__ Sports , medicine , education ... seems kind of random , don't you think ? __eou__ It might seem that way , but this events were all carefully chosen based on marketing research . These are the events that our customers and potential customers care about . __eou__
I understand we will need seven air conditioning units on the two floors.That ' s what you think , yes ? __eou__ Yes . You could use five or six units.But five or six wouldn't be very efficient . I recommend seven . __eou__ And if we take the Decker units you suggested , what would the price be ? __eou__ Let me calculate the price for you . I can give you a 15 % discount if you buy the seven units.Let ' s see here . Your total would be 5929 dollars . __eou__ Isn't there any way we can get central air conditioning in this building ? __eou__ As I said , it is possible , but it would be much more expensive . I think it would be at least 12000 dollars to do a complete system . __eou__ That's too much . We need to use the separate units , I guess . __eou__ It's more practical , and the new units really are very quiet.Your customers won't even notice them . __eou__ So you say we can do it for 6000 dollars . __eou__ Yes , that's for the units.Installation would probably be another 700 to 1000 dollars.But it depends on the time spent , of course . __eou__ You mean installation isn't included ? I'm very surprised . __eou__ No , Ma'am . Installation isn't included.The price I quoted was just for the units . __eou__ In Taipei , you know , the company usually installs the things they sell.They don't charge extra . __eou__ I know that , Ma'am . But they would just raise the price of the units to cover their costs.Here in L . A . , installation is charged separately . __eou__ Yes , I suppose I should get used to it.But I'm not really willing to spend more than 6000 dollars for this.We haven't even opened yet . __eou__ I understand , Ma'am . __eou__ And the other company that gave me a quote on this said they could do it for 4000 dollars . __eou__ It's a question of quality , Ma'am . At that price , you would not get good equipment . I've been in this business for almost twenty years . I know what happens.If you don't get quality air conditioning now , you will just have to replace the system after two years . __eou__ I will tell you what I can agree to.If you can quote me a price of 6000 dollars , installation included , I can accept . __eou__ Well . __eou__ You do seem like a better company than the other one.So I am willing to pay more than 4000 for you . But I won't pay more than 6000 . __eou__ Well , we don't usually do it , but ... I believe we can accommodate you on this.We will do the installation for free . Because we appreciate your business . __eou__ Good . I hope we can arrange the contract as soon as possible . __eou__
We need to do a group report tomorrow . I need to go to the stationer to buy something for the posters . __eou__ You need to make posters ? __eou__ absolutely . Every time when we do the reports , we love making some beautiful posters to emphasize our theme ideas . __eou__ I see . Then let's make a shoppinglIist first before we go there.othe rise , It may take us a whole day to search for the things you need . __eou__ No problem . I need some markers , some color pencils , a pair of scissors , some highlighter , rulers .. __eou__ Wow , it is like a maze , I think I might get lost soon . __eou__ Don't worry.In fact , it is very easy to find what you want . Can you see the sign on top of every shelf . It clearly tells you what things are displayed on every shelf . __eou__ Oh , yes . You are so smart . I see them . So I have to go to shelf number 3 first to get my markers , color pencils and highlighters and somebrushes . __eou__ I also need some thumbtacks , whiteout and paper clips . Which shelf are they on ? I can't find the number . __eou__ It's at the back . I think you are near-sighted . You had better get yourself a pair of nice glasses . __eou__
It's weekend again , I'm glad I can arrange for my personal matters . __eou__ What do you mean by that ? __eou__ Oh , that means I can do whatever I like without few interruptions . __eou__ You've been always active and versatile . It seems that you are interested in everything . __eou__ Oh , really ? I just have lots of hobbies in my spare time ; such as going to the concert , painting , handwriting , reading novels and reading fashion magazines . What about yours ? __eou__ I have fewer hobbies than yours . That's why I find campus life a bit dull and uninteresting . __eou__ Oh , you can't think like that . We young people should try our best to learn new things and accept new ideas . You like taking photos and going to photography shows , why not practise the technique and catch something unforgeable ? __eou__ That's a good suggestion . It's fine today . Maybe I can take photos on the scenery of the lake at sunset . It must be fantastic . __eou__ I quite agree with you . With our hobbies , our life can be more colorful and exciting . __eou__ And I can concentrate on my study after the relaxation over the weekend . __eou__ Yes , it's a good habit to have a life-long hobby . Those who practise calligraphy and Qigong always live longer . __eou__
I ’ Ve always wondered , what ’ s the difference between English for Chinese students and English for native students ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . What do you think ? __eou__ I think a Chinese student concentrates on written English , and uses it as a basis for communicating . From start to finish he ’ s learning vocabulary and fundamentals of grammar . This is a very difficult way to learn . __eou__ What do natives get ? __eou__ They get higher level English , which is more formal than everyday spoken English . They also deal with matters of style and creativity . __eou__ Do you mean that a native doesn ’ t make any mistakes in grammar ? __eou__ Absolutely not ! Native speakers make a lot of grammar mistakes , especially if they come from a home where nonstandard English is spoken . __eou__ I suppose that only a small percentage of college students don ’ t know standard English in American universities . __eou__ Actually there are more non-native speakers than you think . That ’ s why it ’ s so important to quit worrying about making mistakes . Just talk to everyone every chance you get . __eou__
Hey , Daniel , how's it going ? __eou__ Hey , Daddy , today I had really a fantastic history class . __eou__ Wow , it's so strange for you to say things like that . What had happened ? __eou__ We've learnt the story of Zheg He Sailing to West Ocean . He is a real great navigator . __eou__ Did your teacher tell you the route he took ? __eou__ Yeah , he , with his fleet , came across the Indian Ocean , and arrived at the east coast of Africa . __eou__ Great , do you still remember when he started his voyage ? __eou__ Of course , that is from 1405 to 1433 , which is in Ming dynasty . __eou__ Good , by the way , do you finish reading the book Robinson Crusoe I've bought for you ? __eou__ Not yet , you know I have a lot of homework to do . __eou__ You should speed up , because the story of Robinson can give you a better understanding about what you learned today . __eou__ OK , great Daddy , after supper , I'll embark on it . __eou__ That's my boy ! Wait , Daniel , when is Pirates of the Caribbean on ? __eou__ Is it about Captain Jack Sparrow , who wants to find the treasure on the sea ? __eou__ Exactly , now , tell me the time . __eou__ I won't tell you , unless you promise to let me watch it with you . __eou__
I've got to put together a sales pitch to give to our clients in the morning . You always give such amazing presentations , I was hoping you could give me some advice about how to win them over tomorrow . __eou__ Sure , it's easy . First of all , the secret to a successful oral presentation is to keep things simple . People are listening and they usually don't have a long attention spans . Stick to about three or four points , give an overview of the points , then present them one by one , and then summarize at the end . Be straightforward and organized and you're sure to be remembered . __eou__ What kind of visuals should I use to support the presentation ? Do you think I should use PowerPoint ? __eou__ You should consider the size and interests of your audience . In other words , who is listening , and what do they want to hear ... you can put together a PPT with some graphics and animations that will catch people's attention , but be careful not to go overboard . __eou__ I think I can put something together , no problem . But when it comes to tomorrow , I'll just be a bundle of nerves ! How can I get over my fear of speaking in public ? __eou__ You know , stage fright is very normal , most people get nervous before they have to speak in front of large groups . Just prepare well , rehearse beforehand , and trust that you will be great ... and you will be ! __eou__
What shall we do when we find a shortage in the shipment ? __eou__ You should do one of the two things - either to lodge a claim with the shipowner or with the insurance company . __eou__ Shall we leave it to the brokers ? __eou__ Yes . They usually do it . __eou__ Do they charge for that ? __eou__ Of course . In Europe , they charge a commission of 1 % of the amount of the claim for their service . __eou__ Is it the same in America ? __eou__ They do the work without charge to the importer . __eou__ It's part of their service , isn't it ? __eou__ Exactly . __eou__ Is it enough to claim with an on board bill of lading ? __eou__ No , you must also obtain a statement from the shipping agent certifying that the goods were actually loaded on their vessel for shipment . __eou__ I see . By the way , how do we prove the ownership of our goods ? __eou__ You must provide full original set of ocean bills of lading original insurance policy or certificate and the original commercia invoice . __eou__ I see . Thank you . __eou__ You are welcome . __eou__
Who is this on the water buffalo ? __eou__ That's my grand-father . He was a farmer . When he was young , he had to take the water buffalo to graze in the field . __eou__ Oh yes , that was the best job in most farm families . That's where many of them learned to play the flute . __eou__ My grandfather did that too . He used the time to study instead . __eou__ That's interesting . Go on ! __eou__ My grand grandfather was a merchant who ran a small business . He couldn't afford to send my grand father to school . __eou__ So he became a self-taught man ? __eou__ Right . Later he was a soldier and a fireman in the village . When he was middle aged , he became a great man , quite famous . __eou__ In what field ? __eou__ As a leader of police officers in charge of the whole country . __eou__ Is he still in that that type of work . __eou__ No . He retired from that . He is a senator now . __eou__ Would you want to be a senator ? __eou__ Well , maybe when I get old . But first I'll be a lawyer . __eou__
In foreign trade , exporters have to adjust their product in a timely manner . __eou__ How to adjust ? __eou__ Exporters must ensure that their product satisfies customers ' needs , wants and likes . __eou__ Ah , some products are successful at home , but not be popular overseas . __eou__ That's because the fashion , taste and social customs and so on vary considerably . __eou__ Yes , sometimes the differences are great . __eou__ Well , we should be in accordance with national conditions and adjust the product . __eou__ We have to ensure that the product should be attractive to guarantee sales . __eou__
Right , that ends the third and final part of our presentation . I'd like to end by emphasizing the main points . I'll give you a brief summary . There are three potential areas for development in the future , domestic , overseas market , and the internet . Each of these markets have their own particular need for marketing strategy ... for domestic , we can rely on past research , for overseas markets we depend heavily on our cultural consultants , and for the internet , we need to redo our image to appeal to a young set of consumers . Our main issue here is that we need to be sensitive to the needs of different markets in order to continue to see success . Mark , did you have anything to add ? __eou__ Yes , I want to restate one more time the importance of reinventing our company's image to appeal to different customer bases . I want to end with a true story that has to do exactly with what we've been talking about today ... __eou__
Hey Claire , you've been really quiet these last few days . Is something wrong ? __eou__ I've been really stressed . It's the end of the year and I've got so much stuff to do ! I feel like I'm drowning in work . __eou__ Well , stress is a real thing . It's not an imaginary condition . __eou__ It's seriously affecting my life ! I can't sleep , I don't have much of an appetite and my husband says I've been kind of short tempered . Other people seem to handle stress okay ... why am I so weak ? __eou__ You're not weak ... you're stressed out ! Stress has been a part of the human condition for millions of years . Back when we still lived in the trees we had to watch out for predators ... and as you might imagine , that was pretty stressful . __eou__ Yeah , but I don't see any tigers or leopards roaming around our office . My stress is just about silly paperwork ! __eou__ But you're actually having the same reaction as our tree-dwelling ancestors ! It's called the flight or fight response . Each time you feel like something's threatening you , your body decides whether to run away or fight ... it causes all sorts of chemical reactions in the body . __eou__ So a deadline will cause that same reaction ? __eou__ It could . Modern humans actually have more flight or fight responses than our ancestors did . They just had a couple of close calls every day , but today , we have dozens or even hundreds ! __eou__ So the life of a cave woman was less stressful than my life ? __eou__
Excuse me , you look familiar . Did you use to live in New York ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Did you use to work at NYU ? __eou__ Yes , I did . __eou__ Oh , did you know Hugh Young ? He was a music student . __eou__ Hugh Young ? Didn ’ t he use to wear a funny yellow jacket all the time ? __eou__ Yes . And he used to play the piano with a jazz group at the university . __eou__ I remember Hugh . Most people thought he was a little ... uh ... peculiar . Do you know what he ’ s doing now ? __eou__ Yes , he ’ s a millionaire in Houston now . __eou__ A millionaire ? As a jazz musician ? __eou__ Oh , no . He ’ s an executive for a large computer company . I saw an interview with him on TV yesterday . They were asking his opinion about future uses for computers . __eou__ Well ! I guess people don ’ t find him so peculiar anymore . __eou__
Mrs . Phoebe , let's talk about the delivery arrangement for our goods . __eou__ Sure . What's your date of delivery ? __eou__ I informed my company and was told that the first five thousand by the end of this month . __eou__ What about the balance of the order ? Can they also arrive at our company quickly ? __eou__ We can deliver the balance at the price already quoted in 10 days . __eou__ Can you deliver them earlier ? __eou__ I am afraid we can not do that . Would you be willing to sign an annual contract on the basis we discussed ? __eou__ Possibly , subject to quality and delivery guarantees . __eou__ Of course . Well , in that case we could offer a 5 % discount for a confirmed monthly order for the next 12 months . __eou__ I was looking forward to something a bit more substantial . As you know , we have long-time cooperation . __eou__ I'm afraid that's as far as we could go . We'd already be stretching ourselves to the limit . __eou__ Well , let's shake on that and draw up the details of the contract . __eou__
Now that you'recommending such enormous fees , producers , directors , movie-makers must see you in a completely different light . __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ Then the standard that you set yourself originally must have changed . __eou__ Well , if that's the case , I don't mind breaking the image that they might have or the standards that they have . I can only do what I know , and live how I've lived all my life , because I'm a fairly stubborn person . __eou__ It seems to me that now you're famous . You've got to go out and be seen at the right places and go to the right parties . __eou__ I don't go to parties . The parties I go to are the barbecues I have in my house . Being seen in the right places is something that I don't believe in . I don't believe in going to events just for the sake I of being seen . __eou__ Then fans don't see you much in public places . __eou__ Yes . I have a very low-key life ; I have a great life . I love what I do and I love how I spend my time , which isn't in a public place . __eou__ A lot of people compare you to Julia Roberts . I wondered if there was anyone that you compare yourself to in Hollywood , that you've watched and thought , ' Well , they've got something I could use a little bit or could learn a little bit about . ' __eou__ I've never had one person that I'd idolized . The comparisons to Jul-ia Roberts are incredibly flattering . I don't really know who I would compare myself to . I'd like to be a combination of a lot of people . A little bit of everything , really . I haven't quite figured out where my strengths are yet , and I've definitely found my weaknesses . __eou__
Good morning , Jason . How did you sleep ? __eou__ Pretty well , thanks . Still feeling the effects of jet lag a bit , but last night I got at lease six hours of rest . __eou__ Great ! So , are you ready for a full day of shopping ? __eou__ Yep . Let's do it . I'm pretty excited ! __eou__ I know a place that should be perfect . It's called the China Friendship Shopping Center and it's pretty much like an American mall - except with more variety . You can even buy a live chicken there if you want . __eou__ Live chicken ? Thanks , but no thanks . So ... tell me about bargaining . How can I do it like a local ? __eou__ Well . I'll be honest and say you'll never be as good at bargaining as a local person . You're a foreigner and the sellers can see that . But ... if you're smart , you can get bargains that are not too far away from the local price . __eou__ Cool ! Teach me ! __eou__ For starters , you want to do a lot of scouting first . You've got to know what things cost . __eou__ Someone told me to go to a convenience store and see how much a soft drink or a tube of toothpaste costs . The idea is that by comparing the prices of those items , you can figure out the relative prices of everything else . __eou__ That could be helpful . But when you go into a shopping center ... prices become very flexible . You have to be able to read the market . __eou__
Pretty ! Say beautiful rather . Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than she altogether-face and figure ? __eou__ I do not know what I could imagine , but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers . __eou__ Such an eye ! The true hazel eye-and so brilliant ! Regular features , open countenance , with a complexion , Oh ! What a bloom of full health , and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure ! There is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance . One hears sometimes of a child being ' the picture of health ' ; now , she always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health . She is loveliness itself . __eou__
Hey , Ken ... I need to talk to you . __eou__ Sure ... what's up ? __eou__ Can we step into the conference room ? This is a more private conversation . __eou__ Sure ... __eou__ Ok ... I'm just going to lay it all out on the table , What do you think of Vincent's management style ? __eou__ Well , Vincent has only been CEO for a couple of years and ... well ... um ... __eou__ I don't want to put you on the spot . Here's what I'm getting at , I don't think Vincent is the man for the job . __eou__ Really ? And what led you to this conclusion ? __eou__ As I see it , he lacks the proper vision . His style is more about survival , and he's not taking the company anywhere.He ' s treading water instead of swimming . __eou__ Well , I confess I've had my doubts about his abilities before . It seems he mainly got the job because his famous aunt pulled some strings . __eou__ I've been with this firm for 26 years and I'd hate to see it go down the drain due to poor leadership skills . __eou__ Me too . But what can we do ? This isn't a reality TV show ... we can't just vote him out . __eou__ Yes and no ... We can't ask for a show of hands on who thinks he should be fired , but we can introduce a vote of no confidence at the next board meeting . __eou__ Interesting idea . You might be on to something . __eou__
The product's selling points is its advanced technoledge . __eou__ Unfortunately , it's just too expensive for majority of consumer to afford . __eou__ Why is the price so high ? __eou__ It's not just that the price is high , it's that the overhead to update an entire computer system to be compatible is costly . __eou__ Model of computers aren't compatible ? __eou__ Most current computer systems simply can't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities . __eou__ Maybe after the next generation of technology comes out , the price of this model will become more affordable . __eou__ But by then , the technology will be outdated . __eou__ True , but our focus has never been affordability anyway . Coastwise , we may not be very competitive , but qualitywise , we definitely have an edge . __eou__ That's right , no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable . __eou__ This model has advanced technoledge , superior components , it is compact , and it's a top-quality product . __eou__ I guess you get what you pay for . __eou__
Did you see the letter I got from Bradford Films ? They sent it in response to your phone call last week . __eou__ If they wanted to say something about my call last week , why didn ’ t they sand it to me ? __eou__ I guess they must not have your contact information , so they sent it addressed in care of your department head . Anyhow , they wrote to confirm in writing what you discussed about the Milton contract . __eou__ Can I see it for a second ? __eou__ Sure , here it is ... __eou__ Dear Mr . Clark , Further to our telephone call last Friday , I am writing to confirm our meeting on july 21 . As we discusses , our meeting is to review the contract details . __eou__ Did they ask you to send the files beforehand ? __eou__ Let ’ s see , ” we would e grateful if you could please send related materials to our office prior to our meeting . ” It looks like ... hey , was there anything else sent along with this letter ? __eou__ I don't think so , why do you ask ? __eou__ The letter reads , “ please find enclosed a copy of our agenda for your review . ” I don ’ t see anything else in the envelope ... __eou__ Maybe they forgot to attach it to the letter . You should give them another call . __eou__
Okay , so let ’ s go over everything one more time . I really want you to get this job ! __eou__ I know ! It ’ s an amazing growth opportunity ! They ’ re true industry leaders , and it would be so interesting to be part of an organization that is the undisputed leader in business process platform development . __eou__ So , let ’ s see , you did your research on the company , right ? __eou__ Well , I visited their website and read up on what they do . They ’ re an IT service company that offers comprehensive business solutions for large corporations . They provide services such as ARM development , and they also offer customdesigned applications . __eou__ So what would your role in the company ? __eou__ Well , the position is for an account manager . That basically means that I would be the link between our and our development team . __eou__ Sounds good , and so , why do you want to work with them ? __eou__ Well , as I said they ’ re the industry leaders , they have a really great growth strategy , amazing development opportunities for employees , and it seems like they have strong corporate governance . They ’ re all about helping companies grow and unleashing potential . I guess their core values and mission really resonated with me . Oh , and they offer six weeks ’ vacation , stock options and bonuses ... I ’ m totally going to cash in on that . __eou__ You idiot ! Don ’ t say that ! Do you want this job , or not ? __eou__
Why don't you begin by telling me something about yourself ? __eou__ What do you want to know ? __eou__ The usual , you know , something about your background and experience and anything personal that you feel is pertinent . __eou__ Well , I was born in Shanghai and went to school there , right up through college . My father is a lawyer , and my mother is a teacher . __eou__ Sounds as if you come from a professional family . __eou__ That right . One of my sisters is a doctor and the other one teaches at a university . __eou__ What made you decide to get into computers ? __eou__ Oh , nothing in particular , I guess . I always liked mathematics and tinkering with machines . __eou__ Now what about your experience ? How long have you been working with computers ? __eou__ More than five years now . After I did my engineering degree , I began to specialize in computer technology and I even had my own company for a while . __eou__ It certainly sounds impressive . Why don't you have your credentials sent to me and I'll show them to the board ? We'll probably get back to you in a week . __eou__ Thanks very much . __eou__
Hi , Mr . Brown , we have visited the factories and I'm very satisfied with your factories production conditions . __eou__ Yes , they are our main export bases of tools with the advantage of having good production experience and long historical record . All their products enjoy high prestige in the world market . __eou__ That's very good . But I have little knowledge about the packing of your pliers . I just want to know the details about that . __eou__ Ok , I'll show you how the packing is like . We have a showroom on the ground floor . Let's go downstairs and have a look . __eou__ Sure . __eou__ These are the various kinds of packing for pliers . Normally , we have three types of packing __eou__ Oh , the packing looks very nice . __eou__ The skin packing is the most advanced packing for this product in the world market . It catches the eyes and can help push sales . __eou__ Good , what about the export packing ? __eou__ Well , they are packed in boxes of two dozens each , 100 boxes to a wooden case . __eou__ Is the wooden case strong enough for transportation ? You see , 100 boxes of pliers are very heavy . It's about 2,400 kilograms . __eou__ You can rest assured of that . So far , no customers have complained about our outer packing . __eou__ I'm glad to hear that . By the way , do you accept neutral packing ? __eou__ Yes , we can pack the goods according to your instructions . __eou__ Very good . Ok , Mr . Brown , I'm now totally satisfied with your packing . You can execute our first order now , and I will open the L / C immediately after I return to Taipei . __eou__ All right . We'll make the shipment as soon as your L / C is on hand . __eou__
Hi Barbara . Have you lost weight ? __eou__ Hi Julie . Yeah . I've been on a diet for a couple of months now . __eou__ Wow . You look great . __eou__ Thanks for noticing . __eou__ What type of diet were you on ? __eou__ I joined a health club and my trainer gave me tips on eating . With a combination of eating better and exercising , I managed to lose 15 pounds in 2 months . __eou__ That's amazing . What tips did your trainer give you ? __eou__ Mostly on how to exercise , but the best advice I got was changing my eating habits . Instead of eating 3 times a day , she told me to eat 5 times a day . __eou__ That doesn't make sense . If you eat more , than how do you lose weight ? __eou__ Actually , I'm eating the same amount . I eat 5 smaller meals a day . Basically , it naturally speeds up the metabolism and helps to burn fat at a faster rate . __eou__ That makes sense . I'm going to try that . __eou__ You don't need to lose weight . __eou__ I have a little gut I have been trying to get rid of . __eou__ Ah ... but remember to incorporate a little exercise into your diet . __eou__ Thanks for the advice . __eou__ No problem . __eou__
Daddy , I love this Happy Farmhouse . It's really fun . __eou__ Great . But no talking , now . Don't forget that you are on a ladder . Take care ! __eou__ But you are holding it for me . Nothing to worry about . I trust you . Oops , what's that ? __eou__ Don't touch it with your stick . It's a bumble bees ' hive . Get down the ladder . Be quick . __eou__ What would happen if they started attacking you ? __eou__ You can get killed . No kidding . Remember , never stir up a hive . __eou__ I see . Why do people come all the way here to pick apples by themselves and take them home ? Isn't it easier for them to buy the apples in the supermarket ? __eou__ It's for fun . And also , the apples here are Green Food . __eou__ Come on , daddy . You can see that people only pick the red ones . __eou__ Silly boy . Green Food means the plants grown without using any chemicals , fertilizers , and pesticides . __eou__ Oh , then what would happen if there were pests ? __eou__ I heard they used ultraviolet lamp to kill pests . __eou__ Cool ! Well , let's go over there to join mom . I want to tell her all about the special pests-killing method . __eou__

How is everything with you ? __eou__ Not bad . I finally bought a house . It ’ s an old one , but built really solid . It is close to here . Do you want to come over for lunch ? __eou__ I ’ d like that , but I ’ m flying home this afternoon , and I told my parents I ’ d meet them at the airport for lunch . __eou__ OK , next time you ’ re here . __eou__ That ’ s a deal . __eou__ I heard that you moved to Florida . __eou__ Yes , I ’ m in Titusville . The space shuttle is launched from near there . I ’ Ve seen a lot of space shuttle launches . __eou__ Tell me more . __eou__ The shuttle launches are beautiful . I saw one that took off at midnight . The whole sky got bright . __eou__ Sounds great ! __eou__ I ’ m pretty happy living there . __eou__ I want to see Disney World , Sea World , Universal Studios , and Weeki-Watchee Springs . __eou__ I ’ Ve been to all of them . __eou__ I ’ m jealous .

Excuse me . Do you study Chinese at the university here ? __eou__ Yes , I do . But my characters are very bad . __eou__ It takes a long time to learn Chinese writing . __eou__ Are you Chinese ? __eou__ Yes , I am . I am from Taiwan . I came here to study political science . __eou__ How do you like it ? __eou__ I like it so far . But my English still needs work . __eou__ I want to study Mandarin and international relations . __eou__ Does the Chinese department here teach regular characters or simplified characters ? __eou__ They teach regular characters . __eou__ I see . I'm from Taiwan , so I know regular characters better than simplified . __eou__ You just said your English needs work , yes ? __eou__ Yes , that's true . Especially my writing . I think my papers aren't good enough . I make too many grammatical mistakes . __eou__ Well , I am very serious about learning Chinese.But for me the hard part now is pronunciation.You have the four tones in Chinese . It is very hard . Maybe , if you have time , maybe we could do a language exchange . __eou__ You mean you and I ? __eou__ Yes , why not ? I mean , if you come to this cafe often , maybe we could meet here and practice Chinese and English . __eou__ That sounds like a good idea . How often would you like to do it ? __eou__ Let's see ... My schedule right now is quite busy.But I think I could spend 90 minutes a week in language exchange . __eou__ How would we manage it though ? How would we spend the 90 minutes ? __eou__ First , we could spend 45 minutes working on your English writing.If you want , I could help you edit your papers.Or we could do English conversation . Whatever you want.And then the next 45 minutes you would help me with my Chinese . __eou__ Would I help you with writing ? __eou__ No . For me right now , the important thing is spoken Chinese . I need practice . So you could tutor me in speaking.We could use my textbook , and you could ask me questions.Then you could correct my mistakes . __eou__ I think it sounds like a good system . But when is it convenient to meet ? __eou__ Well , today is Monday.Actually , for me Monday at this time would be the best . I am free from now until 11 __eou__ Me too . In fact , I'm free until 1 __eou__ So if you want to meet at 10 __eou__ It sounds good . I will bring the papers I'm working on . __eou__ And I will bring my textbook and a tape recorder . I would like to record some things so I can practice on my own . __eou__ Let me give you my phone number . __eou__ Sure . I'll give you mine too . Then we can call if we have to cancel for some reason . __eou__
Our productivity has been down for more than six months now . I'm seriously considering pulling in an outside consultant to diagnose the cause of our problematic areas . I think we'd all benefit from an outsider's perspective . Sometimes we're just too closed to the problems to see the forest for the trees . __eou__ I think that's a good idea . You know I got a golfing buddy that runs a consultant firm . He's an expert in organizational comunication.He does't come cheap , but he's an expert in this field.Maybe he could help get things on track . __eou__ Do you have his card ? What's in his portfolio ? Which firm has he worked for in the past ? __eou__ He's done staff for Microsoft and Boeing . I think he's been involved with Siemens ' training evaluations as well . I'll get you his card , you can give him a call . __eou__
Mr Hughes ? Do you have a minute ? I would like to discuss something with you . __eou__ What can I do for you ? __eou__ I was wondering , I have heard many of my co-wokers that your knowledge and experience in international markets is phenomenal . Also , I ’ Ve heard the rumor that you speak fluent Japanese . Is that right ? __eou__ Yes , that ’ s right . I do speak decent Japanese . __eou__ Right now I ’ m working on a product launch project to open up our Asian market . We have several upcoming events to take place for the Japanese cities . We ’ ll be heading to Tokyo next month to get things started . What I would like to talk to you about is joining our team to help bring this project to completion . __eou__ Exactly what kind of help did you have in mind ? __eou__ We aer looking for someone who is familiar with the market and cultural issues to act as an advisor to our marketing staff . We would like to set up a partnership , where we can help each other . __eou__ So if I can help you as a consultant , what is in for me ? __eou__ We could give you an uncite office , as well as potential to develop your own contracts in Japan.At the same time , after helping with our project , we will be willing to split our profit with you . __eou__
Oh Gush ! The first day of my career is over . I can not breathe now after dealing with so many documents . But I heard the notice that our company will hold two-week staff training . __eou__ Stop fussing ! It is said that the training is important for our newcomers . And my company also informs me to attend the training next week . __eou__ But for me , the training is waste of my precious time . __eou__ I disagree with you . Companies usually make a workable and reasonable plan for the trainings , so as to improve new comers ' understanding of the company and its rules in short time . Through the training , we get to know many things , such as the corporate culture and spirit . Our newcomers can really grasp the essence of the company __eou__
Here are the leads from last week's exhibit as a trade show . There are about forty or so that are hot . You should contact them immediately , in the next twenty-four hours if you can . The rest are categorized according to potential and interest.You can see we've got our hot stack , our warm stack , our lukewarm , and our cold but not dead stack . __eou__ Haha ... please don't tell me you've got a dead stack . I hate making cold calls ... __eou__ Don't worry , most of the leads on mildly interested , if not strongly interested . We've just got to make sure the Hot ones are contacted right away . And even the contacts that for what ever reason aren't prepared to make an order now , they might be interested in the future . Please be conscanciouss about getting a hold of everyone of these leads . We've spent a big chunk of marketing budget to find these people . I don't want our investment to go down the drain . __eou__ Don't worry , I've gotchy covered . __eou__
Julie , what's on the tube ? __eou__ nothing but bench of commercials . These days the amount of commercials is amazing . __eou__ yeah . Maybe we can change to another channel . what about the sports channel ? Let's see if there's a game on . __eou__ okay . Nope , it's a replay of yesterday's soccer match between Brazil and Spain . __eou__ it was a good game , but not good enough to watch again . Keep surfing . __eou__ alright . Hmm , this movie is a rerun ... I don't know how many times I've seen this show ... Commercial again ... and a replay of the talk show ... oh no , this show is terrible , you don't wanna watch it . __eou__ oh , what is it ? __eou__ it's a total rip-off of an American reality show , but the imitation is unbearably clumsy . __eou__ oh , I know this kind of shows . Sometimes they really piss me off . If I wanted reality , I'd go outside . __eou__ yeah ... it seems what we have on TV now are either repeats , or commercials , or low-quality shows . There's really nothing to watch . __eou__ I don't get it . We have more than 100 channels and there's still nothing good on ! Maybe we should just turn off the TV , get outside , and do something real . __eou__ cool . __eou__
What does your company do exactly ? __eou__ We design and assemble a wide range of electric generators for hospitals , hotels anc small factories . We specialise in medium-sized generators but we're hoping to diversify into larger models next year . __eou__ And who do you sell to ? __eou__ We export to Eastern Europe and the Far East . The domestic market accounts for about 40 percent of our total sales . __eou__
I often sneeze after having a bad itch inside my nose . Sometimes this is accompanied by an itching throat . __eou__ Any other discomfort ? __eou__ Yes . Sometimes I can notice a constriction in the chest and shortness of breath after a fit of sneezing . And I often suffer from a running nose with a profuse watery discharge . __eou__ Does it occur seasonally or all year round ? __eou__ It has been seasonal during these past three years . __eou__ Are you sensitive to other things ? __eou__ Yes , things like seafood and penicillin-type drugs . __eou__ OK . Let me examine your nose . According to your case history and the examination , I believe that it's allergic rhinitis . __eou__ What useful treatment can you offer ? __eou__ I'll give you a series of specific skin tests . Then we'll know exactly what substances you're allergic to . Then I'll give you some causes of desensitization therapy . __eou__
Are there any special requirements on the project ? And shall we talk around it in details ? __eou__ Yes , there're some samples in our office and you can take some to study it . Besides , you see , in recent years , we've visited a diversity of factory buildings all over the world and we hope that our building is the perfect match of advanced technology and attractiveness . __eou__ That's a good idea . We can improve our technology to meet your special need . __eou__ And please let white color dominate . __eou__ OK ! I've noted it down . And any others ? __eou__ Oh ! I've almost forgot the location was transferred to the A county in the east of the city . __eou__ I'll tell them . __eou__ Well , the most important thing is that our company demand the quality be exactly the same as the sample which you'll take from the office on the third floor . __eou__ Please feel assured that we'll abide by our promise . And we'll do everything we can to ensure delivery . __eou__ Thanks a lot . And I believe I'll have a good time working with you . __eou__ I think so . Bye ! __eou__ Bye ! __eou__
Albert and I need a lot of things to furnish our house.But I don't know where the best place to shop is . Can you give me some advice ? __eou__ Sure , Carolyn . I'm happy to help you.What kinds of things do you need right now ? __eou__ Well , we have most of the furniture already.We mostly need kitchen utensils , bathroom accessories , cleaning and laundry accessories--things like that.And Albert wants to set up a little off __eou__ Well , as for Albert , he should go to an office supply store.There ' s a very good one called Office Depot . They have everything he will need.And their prices are good too . It's very convey __eou__ Can I write that down ? __eou__ Sure , it's spelled Office and then D - E - P - O - T.It ' s in the Yellow Pages . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ And as for the kitchen things , do you want very high quality ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I mean , do you want the best quality , or do you want good prices ? __eou__ Probably good prices . You know we will only be in America for about a year . __eou__ Then I suggest you go to K-Mart or Wal-Mart . __eou__ What are those stores ? __eou__ They are very large , discount department stores.That means their prices are very good.And you can find everything you need for the kitchen or bathroom . __eou__ Even silverware ? __eou__ Yes , everything.They don't have the most expensive brands , but their quality is usually decent.The main thing is , they have good prices , and they are very convenient . __eou__ I have a friend that said something about a place called Price Club.Do you know about that ? __eou__ I have never shopped there , but I think Price Club is a kind of membership store . __eou__ What does that mean ? __eou__ That means you have to pay a membership fee to shop there . I have heard they have very good prices on electronics . __eou__ Electronics ? __eou__ Yes . Like stereos and televisions . __eou__ How much is the membership fee ? __eou__ I'm not sure.But if you are only going to stay a year , I don't think Price Club is good to join.They have great deals occasionally.They are very good for people who like to buy new things all __eou__ I see . Thanks for these tips . We really need to buy a lot of little things . __eou__ I know how it is . Moving is very troublesome . __eou__
How was your self-help trip ? __eou__ Excellent . As soon as we landed , we boarded a bus to Disneyland . I love Mickey Mouse . Janet and I spent the entire first day going on all of the rides . __eou__ Didn't you feel any jet lag from the change in time zones ? __eou__ I felt fine . I must have been too excited to notice . __eou__ I've never been to Disneyland . I went to Universal Studios when I was fifteen . My parents took my brother Franco and I to Los Angeles and San Francisco.Wish you and Janet love each other more . __eou__
What do you consider to be your strong points ? __eou__ I think I ’ m tough not only physically but mentally . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ I have been playing football since high school . At present , I ’ m a member of a community football club . __eou__ Really ? Are you still playing ? __eou__ Yes . I practice every weekend with my teammates . __eou__ I see . You must be tough . __eou__ I never get tired . I think this comes from practicing football . __eou__ What do you consider to be your weak points ? __eou__ Frankly speaking , I ’ m a typical Chinese workaholic . I don ’ t mind working late at night . Due to that , I tend to leave the office late . __eou__ What kind of people are you reluctant to work with ? __eou__ So far I haven ’ t met any particular kind . However , I may rule out those who prefer chatting to working . __eou__ Do you prefer to work alone or as part of a team ? __eou__ It depends on the type of work . Usually I prefer to work alone , because I ’ m self-motivated . But I can work either way . If necessary , I don ’ t hesitate to join the team . __eou__
Sorry to bother you sir , but I have some bad news . __eou__ What is it ? __eou__ Well , the stock market just took a huge plunge and we ’ Ve lost a lot of money ! __eou__ What do you mean ? What happened ? __eou__ There are many factors that weigh in , but NASDAQ is down 200 points , the DOW JONES indicator also suffered ! Our portfolio is worth half of what it was worth points week ago . __eou__ How is this possible ? You are supposed to be talking to our stockbrokers and making sure that our securities and investments are safe and making a profitable return ! __eou__ I know sir ! We didn ’ t expect a bull market to become a bear market all of a sudden . On the other hand , you still have some high yield trash bonds and government bonds that will give us enough liquidity to cut our loses and reinvest in emerging markets . We could potentially make this tragedy work for us and make us think outside the box . __eou__ Do what you have to do ! One other thing , don ’ t tell the rest of the stockholders about this . If they find out , it ’ s the end of this company ! __eou__
The sun is up ! Time for all the campers to rise . Time to get paddling . __eou__ Oh , no ! No more paddling ! My arms are sore ! __eou__ Do not worry . Today will be easier . __eou__ Beth , what date is today ? __eou__ Today is Saturday . __eou__ What is the date today ? __eou__ Today is July 4th . __eou__ Oh , i almost forgot . Today is my mom's birthday . __eou__ Call her on my cell phone . Wish her “ Happy Birthday ! ” Tell her you are out exploring the great American wilderness . Tell her I said she is lucky to be born on Independence Day . __eou__ Thanks ! I will do that ! When is your birthday ? __eou__ It is December 25th . __eou__ Wow ! What a lucky girl ! Your birthday is on Christmas Day . __eou__ Yes , I am lucky . I was born on Christ ’ s birthday . Maybe that is why I usually go to church on Sundays . When is your birthday ? __eou__ April 2nd . I missed being a target of a lot of jokes by one day . I guess I am lucky , too ! __eou__ That is true ! Here , have some Granola for breakfast . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ After eating , we will take down our tent . Then we will pack everything into the canoe , We can shove off by 6 __eou__ I guess so . __eou__ How about going for swim around 10 __eou__ That should work out great . You are miracle worker ! You have got me awake and motivated . __eou__ Happy Independence Day ! __eou__
Hello . Nice to see you again . I heard you went into hospital for a few days to undergo surgery . I hope everything ’ s OK . __eou__ Yes , fine . I had something wrong with my stomach . I won ’ t go into detail , but it wasn ’ t serious . __eou__ I really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital . __eou__ I think most people are a little nervous about it . I was really very , very nervous just before I had the operation , but the anaesthetist gave me an anaesthetic and the next thing I remember was waking up after the operation . __eou__ It must have really hurt afterwards . __eou__ Well , the nurse game me plenty of painkillers , but it did feel uncomfortable . I wasn ’ t permitted to eat anything for 48 hours . That was the worse thing . __eou__ I bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital . __eou__ I certainly was ! However , the doctor gave me a list of food I couldn ’ t eat for another 72 hours , and steak was on the list ! __eou__ Is there any pain now ? __eou__ No , not at all . I stopped taking painkillers after a couple of days . __eou__ Did they take good care of you in the hospital ? __eou__ Oh , yes . The nurse were very kind , though they were strict about what I could drink . In the end , I just drank water and nothing else . Everyone was very professional and I actually enjoyed some aspects of my stay . __eou__
Hello , Mr . Wang . I am glad to meet you here at the fair . __eou__ Like wise . Take a seat , please . How about a cup of tea ? __eou__ Sure . Thank you . It seems your business is prosperous . There are many customers here . __eou__ Yes , it's not too bad . Our sales are going up year after year . And we still have a large potential production capacity . __eou__ Well , what do you think of choosing a commission representative or agent abroad to promote your sales ? __eou__ That's a good idea . So far , we have several agents abroad . __eou__ We are willing to be your agent in Thailand for hand-held tools . What do you think ? __eou__ That sounds good . __eou__ Then , what's your usual commission rate for your agents ? __eou__ Usually , we give a commission of 4 % to our agents . __eou__ 4 % is too low , I think . You see , we have a lot of work to do in sales promotion , such as advertising on radio or TV , printing booklets , leaflets , catalogues and so on . It all costs money , 4 % is not enough . __eou__ Don't worry . We'll allow you a higher commission rate if your sales score a substantial increase . __eou__ You mean to saya __eou__ It sounds OK . Then how do you pay the commission ? __eou__ We may deduct the commission from the invoice value directly or remit it to you after payment . __eou__ All right . If it's okay , we would like to sign an agency agreement with you immediately . __eou__ Think it over . We hope to keep a good business relationship with you . __eou__ Thank you for your help . __eou__
I love breathing fresh air in the suburb places , while sitting in the morning sunshine . __eou__ I can't agree more , honey . We need to get away from work from time to time . __eou__ Yeah , just return to nature and feel the thrills of its beauty . __eou__ We are nor alone here . So many other families ! __eou__ Sure . The sunny days of spring are ideal for outdoor gatherings . __eou__ Well , let's go over there and put a blanket on the lawn . __eou__ OK , you go back to our car and fetch the picnic stuff . __eou__ Oh , so heavy ! What have you put in here ? __eou__ Nothing special . Food , drinks , and Daniel's kangaroo toys . __eou__ Toys ? Why do we need toys for a picnic ? __eou__ He said he would like to be our tour director and he lined up many things to do . __eou__ Sure , then . May it really be a day of enjoyment . Other than that , we can also teach him something about science . __eou__ Science ? What are you talking about ? Forget about your science , OK ? It's a picnic ! __eou__ I mean we can inspire him for a deeper understanding of the natural world . __eou__ I can't agree on that . Just cut it out . Give him a break and don't spoil the day . __eou__ Well , OK . you are always right . __eou__
Tomorrow is Sunday . Let's go out and get some fresh air . __eou__ I know there is a beautiful farm in the countryside near Taipei . Are you interested in going there ? __eou__ why not ? I love animals and I love nature . __eou__ You can see many cows and horses there . lf you are brave enough , you can try horseback riding . it is fun . __eou__ sounds very interesting . I can't wait to go there . __eou__ Wow ! It is huge and you can do many activities here . __eou__ That is true . Some people go camping , some people pick fresh fruit , some people go boating and some people go grass skiing . __eou__ I never knew there were so many fun things to do on a farm . __eou__ Well , now you know . Let's go to the lake over there . Some people are fishing over there . I haven't had a chance to fish in a lake , I really want to try . __eou__ I think we need to buy some baits and borrow some fish poles first . __eou__ Yes . we can get what we need at the stands right by the lake . Who do you think will catch a big fish first ? __eou__ Of course . I will . __eou__ Wait and see . I want to try horseback riding after fishing . It looks very exciting and fun . __eou__ It is . However , you will suffer from muscle pain for many days you are a first-time rider . __eou__ No problem . It is always worth trying something new once in your life time . __eou__
It has just occurred to me that there is still another possibility to ensure a prompt delivery of the goods . __eou__ And that is ? __eou__ How about making Hong Kong the port of shipment instead of New York ? __eou__ I'm afraid we can't agree to that . We concluded the business with you here in Houston , and the goods you ordered are manufactured in New York . We wish to point out that all orders accepted by us are shipped from New York or Seattle . Hong Kong is out of the question . __eou__ It's like this . There are only one or two ships sailing a month from New York to Osaka , while sailings from Hong Kong are quite frequent . If shipment were effected from Hong Kong , we could receive the goods much earlier . __eou__ I see . You want to have your goods shipped from New York to Osaka via Hong Kong , where they can be transshipped . Is that the idea ? __eou__ Yes , exactly , because I want these goods on our market at the earliest possible date . __eou__ Your idea may be a good one , but the trouble is that there are risks of pilferage or damage to the goods during transshipment at Hong Kong . How about shipping them from Seattle instead of network ? You may choose either one as port of shipment . It makes no difference to us . There are more sailings from Seattle than from New York . __eou__ It sounds all right to me , but I will have to think about it . I'll give you a definite answer tomorrow . If I choose Seattle , will it be possible for you to ship the goods by the end of March ? __eou__ We'll try our best . Anyway , we assure you that shipment will be made not later than the first half of April . __eou__
Gosh , another stop.It seems the cars ahead of us have to stop every two minutes , It's no quicker than a bus . __eou__ That's true . During rush hours , taxis are just as quick as buses . __eou__ It was silly of me to have taken a taxi . __eou__ At least , it can free you from the crowd . By the way , do you come from China ? __eou__ No , from New Zealand , sir . I visited New Zealand and saw lots of overseas people there . __eou__ Wow , like America . It receives a great number of visitors every year . __eou__ The more the world becomes open , the more people become international ! __eou__
My god , it's such a lovely lake ! The lake has a water surface of 56 square kilometers . __eou__ No wonder it looks so huge . __eou__ We are now walking on what is in fact an island . Here we get one of the 10 sceneries of the West Lake , Autumn Moon over the Calm Lake . __eou__ Why is it called Autumn Moon over the Calm Lake ? __eou__ It's so named because in the pavilion over there the great poet Bai Buyi of the Tang Dynasty would take a rest after drinking a little too much , and watch the moon over the lake . __eou__ Very romantic . __eou__ Now let's board the boat and have a ride on the lake . __eou__ Sure ( They get on the boat ) . __eou__ Wang , what's that building over there ? It looks like some sort of a huge pavilion . __eou__ You are right . That's the Heart of Lake Pavilion , situated on an islet.It was built in 1552 and is the largest pavilion on the West Lake . Oh , here we are at the Little Yingzhou island . Let's get off the boat . Please watch your steps . __eou__
We have received your resume in answer to our ads . I would like to talk with you regarding your qualification for this position , OK ? __eou__ It is my honor to have this chance for this interview . Well , my major is commercial English . You know , and I am not only familiar with useful English expressions in business , but also learn some theories on this field . Besides , during my college learning period , I also attended some commercial activities to strive for the opportunity of practicing what I learned . __eou__ What is your greatest weakness ? __eou__ Well , I was a diligent student when I stayed in my college . I dislike meeting the deadline , when I am working on a project . I am always willing to complete it well ahead of the schedule . __eou__ What is the greatest disappointment in your life ? __eou__ Well , I lost my grandpa when I was only ten . I often recall the period when he fed me . __eou__ Well done ! Another question ! When will you start work , if you are hired ? __eou__ I will start my work at the beginning of next month . __eou__
What arrangement will you make about payment ? __eou__ We shall open an irrevocable L / C to cover our shipment from Shanghai to Hamburg . Is it at sight or after sight ? __eou__ At sight of course . __eou__ Some customers demand that 80 % of the credit amount be paid at sight , and the rest be paid after the machines are proved satisfactory on trial . __eou__ I am afraid that can't be done . We have never done business on such terms . __eou__ But such terms are quite common in the machinery trade . Other suppliers are offering better terms . Some even allow payment 60days after sight . __eou__ We ask for full payment at sight , because we guarantee 90 % mechanical efficiency for all our products . You don't have the same guarantee from other suppliers . The usual percentage is around 85 . __eou__ That's true . I'm eager to know if you could send some fitters to ensure good operation . __eou__ Yes . We usually send technicians abroad to offer after-sales service to our customers . __eou__ If you send fitters along with the machines to ensure that all the machines run properly , and if you provide after-sales service , we agree to make the payment in full . __eou__ Thank you . I am glad we have come to an agreement at last . __eou__
What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ Your secretary seems to think she is being harassed . __eou__ What ? You've got to be kidding me ! __eou__ I wish I were , but i am deadly serious . She said you invited her to dinner last week . __eou__ Of course I did . As recognition for a job well done . Once a month I invite the most productive employee to dinner . __eou__ Well , there is no problem there . But she seemed to think that you were angry when she refused , and that your motives are personal and not professional . __eou__ I think she's misinterpreted my intentions . What happens now ? __eou__ Our harassment policy requires that we have a meeting with the HR manager and Miss Brown . It's quite serious . You could be reprimanded , or even fired if we find evidence that you were pressuring __eou__ I understand that . But I hope that we can get to the bottom fo this and show Miss Brown that she misunderstood my reaction . __eou__ That's the purpose of the meeting . Sometimes a mediated conversation will straighten things out , and a little discussion and apology can calm the waters . __eou__
I just got a call from Mrs . Fitzgerald . See what your Willie has just done . __eou__ My Willie ? Why has he suddenly become my Willie ? __eou__ Because he takes after you , he's got into trouble again . __eou__ What did he do this time ? I remember last time he was painting her fence to repay her for breaking it , and he accidentally painted her cat . __eou__ That was last time . This time it's worse . __eou__ Ok , tell me . __eou__ Well , he was playing baseball with some friends ... __eou__ And the ball went through her window ? That's not as bad as last time . __eou__ True , but that's not all . The ball went through the window and hit the vase she has in her front window ... __eou__ Ok , that's probably expensive , but not that bad . __eou__ And then , ricocheted off her fish bowl . Mrs . Fitzgerald at the last minute dived and saved her fish . __eou__ At least the fish were saved . If that's the end of the damages , then everything isn't that bad . __eou__ Stop interrupting me . Finally , the ball flew through the air and knocked out Willie's school principal , who was having a cup of coffee with Mrs . Fitzgerald . __eou__ Hmm , that is bad . __eou__
Hi , Fanny . __eou__ Hi , Andy . __eou__ Are you feeling OK ? You sound a little tired this morning . __eou__ I did not sleep much last night . I really feel bad . It was a crazy night . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ I had a bad dream . I was walking alone in the graveyard , and suddenly all the ghosts jumped out of their graves . They began to chase me through the graveyard and shouted that they wanted my blood . __eou__ Oh , what a nightmare ! Then what happened ? __eou__ My mother woke me up . She had heard me crying out for help . __eou__ You have got a great mother . __eou__ I felt embarrased . After all , I am 18 years old . Mom gave me some chocolate cookies and a glass of milk . __eou__ That sounds good ! __eou__ Yeah , but i was afraid to fall back asleep . I am worrying about getting into the University of Michigan . __eou__ Me too . But I tell myself that if they don ’ t accept me , another school will . __eou__
Look , daddy is on again . Don't you think he is handsome ? __eou__ To some extent , he is . And what do you think we move to a better place ? I can't see him clearly from here . __eou__ The seats in the middle of this stadium are great , but they're already occupied by somebody else . __eou__ Oh , thank you for pointing that out . By the way , have you been following NBA for this season ? __eou__ Of course , tomorrow evening there will be a most exciting game . __eou__ Who plays who ? __eou__ Rockets vs Lakers . Yao Ming , my idol , will appear in front of several hundred million of the worldwide audience . __eou__ It's amazing . And when did he begin to play in the NBA ? __eou__ In 2002 . And since then he has attracted more attention than ever . __eou__ I can't consider you as a little kid any more . I know he is very tall . __eou__ Oh , you know something . He is 2.26 meters tall . But he is also nimble and skillful . __eou__ I also heard if a player has committed 5 fouls then he must be out of the game . __eou__ Yes , what's worse is he can't take any further part in the game . __eou__ That's really terrible . Oh , God , we forgot to cheer for Daddy . __eou__ Never mind . After all he is not so attractive as Yao Ming , right ? __eou__ You are always so naughty . __eou__
Now I know why I split up with Mike . We found we were simply not good for each other . __eou__ In what ways ? __eou__ Well , he is a typical Sagittarius guy , while I am a Cancer . We aren't really compatible __eou__ Ha-ha , so you believe in astrology ? __eou__ What's strange about that ! As a person born under the sign of Cancer , I am home-loving and wish for a peaceful family life . But according to astrology , Sagittarius guys are too adventurous and risk-taking.They seldom think of leading a settled and peaceful life . __eou__ Is that so ? I'm afraid it is too narrow-minded to judge people using astrology . It's all stereotypes ! __eou__ But in my case , the fact matches the theory . Mike is humorous , energetic , always as fresh as a daisy , but probably too ambitious . It frightens me ! __eou__ But as far as I remember , you two caught on like a house on fire when you first met . __eou__ Exactly . But later on , he cares more about his career than love . Work seems to be the better all , and all for him-so much that he doesn't even grudge sparing a day out with me . __eou__
... And now , let ’ s go to Kenny Williams for today ’ s weather forecast . __eou__ Thank you Bill , and good morning Salt Lake City ! __eou__ What ’ s the weather looking like today , Kenny ? __eou__ Well , it ’ s a bit of a mixed bag in Utah today . we ’ Ve got heavy cloud cover here in Northern Utah , and we ’ re calling for scattered showers throughout the day , with a day-time high of forty-five degrees.Now , if we move down to the south of the state , we can see that a cold front is moving in.We can expect clear skies , but it will be quite cold , with temperatures hovering around the thirty degree mark . __eou__ It ’ s a chilly day folks , so don ’ t forget your coats ! What about tomorrow Kenny ? Do you have good news for us ? __eou__ Well , it ’ ll be a rainy day for Northern Utah.we can expect some isolated downpours in the morning . Winds will be coming in from the North East , with gusts reaching twenty-three miles per hour . Salt Lake City can expect the rain to turn to sleet in the evening . Things are looking a bit better for the South.we ’ ll see cloudy skies with a chance of showers . Later in the day , we can expect partlycloudy skies , with a forecast high of thirty-eight degrees . __eou__ You heard it folks ! It ’ s gonna be a cold one ! __eou__ That ’ s right Bill . We will have more later on today on the six o ’ clock news . That ’ s the weather forecast for this morning . __eou__
I know that you are interested in our washers . __eou__ Yes , we are thinking of placing an order . However we would like to know what kinds of machines are available for export and in addition your sales terms , including mode of payment , discount and possible date of delivery . __eou__ We supply washers of all types and sizes . We have years of experience in the manufacture of washers . __eou__ We have read about this in your sales literature . Could you give us some idea of your prices ? __eou__ Our prices compare favorably with those offered by other manufactures either in Europe or anywhere else . Here are our latest price lists . You will see that our prices are very attractive . __eou__ Do you take special orders ? That is , do you make machines according to the specific requirements from clients ? __eou__ Sure , we do . __eou__ How long does it usually take you to make delivery ? __eou__ As a rule , we deliver all our orders within three months after receipt of relevant L / C . It takes longer , of course , for special orders . In no case would it take longer than six months . __eou__ Good . One more thing , we'd like you to quote us on CIF basis . __eou__ Okay . No problem . __eou__
hi , Betty.what ' s up ? __eou__ nothing special . how about you ? Are you used to the life here in the States ? __eou__ everything has been fine for the past several months . __eou__ great ! __eou__ well , I wish someone could talk to me about Western table manners __eou__ sounds interesting . Where did you get the idea ? __eou__ as you know , table manners in China are quite different from those of Westerners . __eou__ absolutely . that's because both of us have distinctive cultural features . __eou__ for example , in China , it's okay to talk while eating . However , you may regard it as rude . __eou__ yes . this must be a huge difference . __eou__ can you think of anything else ? __eou__ sure . We tend to think that the slower on eats , the more polite one seems . __eou__ I didn't know that before . __eou__ and we never sip or slurp the soup loudly . we quietly like little mouthfuls . __eou__ i got it . i'll bear it in mind . __eou__ don't worry . i'm sure our etiquette will become a natural part of your behavior as time goes by . __eou__ I hope so . __eou__
What's up ? You sound a little down in dumps . __eou__ I quarreled with my roommate last night . He is really stubborn . __eou__ Calm down ! Shouting won ’ t help ? __eou__ He is really outrageous . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ I went back home last night . You know tired as a dog , so I took a quick shower and went to bed . I couldn't fall asleep , because Brian was there in the living room , playing his stupid stereo so loud . I kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . He shouted at me . __eou__ What ? He can't do this to you . __eou__ Well , he did it anyway . Then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah ... you know . __eou__ What did you do ? __eou__ I shouted it back of course . __eou__ Hold it , Mike . You won't accomplish anything by hollering at him , right ? You worked it all up till now . Why not wait until you cool down a bit ? __eou__ What would you do if you were in my shoes ? __eou__ Just stay cool . You know . When you get back home tonight , tell him that you didn't mean to quarrel with him . __eou__ No way , Kate . I mean it's just not my fault . __eou__ I know . It wouldn't hurt much to say sorry first . And after that , you can casually mention the problem . I am sure he will cooperate . __eou__ I am too angry to do that . __eou__
Do you think chinese families have changed much in the last 50 years ? __eou__ I think families everywhere have changed a lot in the last 5 decades . __eou__ What do you think is the biggest change ? __eou__ Well , in the past , three or four generations would live together under the same roof . Nowadays , living in the same city as one's relatives is becoming rare . __eou__ That's true . You know , some husbands and wives don't even live in the same city any more . __eou__ Would you consider having your parents live with you when they get older ? __eou__ I guess I'm a bit old-fashioned . I'd rather have my parents live with me than live in a retirement room . __eou__ That's very respectable , but I could never live with my parents . I usually only see them at our christmas celebration — and that's enough ! __eou__ How about your other siblings ? Do they spend a lot of time with your parents ? __eou__ Two of my sisters still live at home , even though they have already graduated from university and have good jobs . They enjoy spending their free time with my parents . I guess in that respect , I'm the black sheep of the family . __eou__ I see . Do your parents ever ask you to come home to visit them more often ? __eou__ They're always asking me to come home , but I think our relationship is better if we keep a distance from each other . Whenever we see each other , all we do is fight . __eou__
We ’ Ve been over this a thousand times . The data is irrefutable ! Look , we ’ Ve done extensive research , built studies , and read the literature , and there is conclusive evidence to support my theory ! __eou__ Horowitz , I beg to differ . Even in your most recent study , the investigative approach was flawed ! You know as well as I do that the collection of data was not systematic , and there is a large margin of error . To draw a definitive conclusion based on that data would be misleading __eou__ That is preposterous ! __eou__ You are trying to single-handedly solve one of the world ’ s greatest mysteries , and yet you are oblivious to the fact that you are wrong ! __eou__ I am not wrong ! The chicken came first ! __eou__ No ! The egg came first ! __eou__
Bob , you're so lucky that you've come at the right time-the 2005 International Tourism Festival is around the corner . __eou__ We've heard about that festival before . It would be quite helpful if you could give us some highlights of the festival . __eou__ My pleasure . Well , the festival is going to start on the third Saturday of October , and covers over one hundred diverse programs in one month . __eou__ What do you think we can see during the festival ? __eou__ I don't know what to suggest . There're so many attractions , and they all sound interesting . One exciting program might be the Ten Thousand People Cycling round the Town . You can choose from the five routes that lead to different destinations . __eou__ I'd like to take the one that goes to the Wild Animal Park . __eou__ Then you can take Route No . 5 . Next I would suggest the International Dragon Boat Race where you can watch Lion Dance , Dragon Boat racing , and many other water shows . __eou__ Wow , must be interesting to watch dragon boats compete a-gainst one another on the city river . __eou__
Hey , Jane ... are you familiar with our company's insurance policies ? __eou__ Umm ... I think so . What's up ? __eou__ I've never really paid attention to the fine print of our insurance policies ... but it looks like I'm going to need to make a claim . __eou__ Really ? Are you OK ? __eou__ I have a slipped disc in my lower back and the doctor says surgery is probably the best option . Does our worker insurance cover this kind of thing ? __eou__ If the injury is workplace related I'm sure it's completely covered . __eou__ Hummum ... I think I'll have to talk to the doctor again about that.Anyway ... now that I'm going to have to make some claims , I think I'd better try and understand how the system works . Would you mind breaking it down for me ? __eou__ Sure . Basically we have two insurance policies for employees ... workman's compensation and medical insurance . The company pays the premiums for workman's compensation , and for a significant part of the medical coverage , but you pay part of that premium , too . __eou__ That's the charge for insurance I see on my pay slip each month , right ? __eou__ Yep . Every country in the world has a different system , but here we buy insurance from a private provider . __eou__ So workman's compensation is if I slip and break my arm while working in the office or on the job , right ? __eou__ That's right . The company pays for all your medical bills and there is also some financial compensation if you have to take days off to see doctors or spend time recuperating . __eou__
Cool camera . What are its features ? __eou__ It's loaded ! For example , it's got a 256 color , LCD screen that rotates 360 degrees , and switches to black and white in power save mode . Also , it has a low-light mode for night shooting and touch screen menu controls that are really convenient . __eou__ What about the quality of the pictures ? __eou__ Oh , it's the usual 5600x3200 resolution with 10.0 megapixels . It's got a 5xzoom , so from 28mm to 120mm the pictures look great ! I can change the resolution , too . __eou__ Wow ! What about the memory ? __eou__ It has a built-in hard-wired memory , but I like to use the 64MB media cards that come with it . I can download everything onto the hard drive and then edit and enhance with different software . It takes fantastic pictures that I can either print out or E-mail to my friends . __eou__
You seem really ticked off . What's up ? __eou__ Just get out of my face , would you ? __eou__ Chill out ! What's eating you , anyway ? __eou__ Sorry . I'm just that I think I blew the final and now my parents are going to get all bent out of shape . I like totally drew a blank on everything ! __eou__ Well , now you're really going to freak out when I tell you who aced it ... what's-her-face ... the one who always kisses up to the teacher . __eou__ Jennifer Davies ? Give me a break ! I can't stand her . She's such a dweeb ! How could she possibly ace it when she keeps cutting class all the time ? __eou__ She's the teacher's pet , that's why . Besides , he's so laid back he lets her get away with it . She just really rubs me the wrong way . And you know what ? I think she's got the hots for him , too . __eou__ Get out of here ! __eou__ I'm dead serious . Yesterday , before class starts , she walks up to Mr - Edward's desk and goes , ‘ Good morning , Jim . ’ __eou__ Oh , gag me ! She's totally gross ! __eou__
Are you excited about your trip next month ? __eou__ Yes and no . I can ' t wait to go to Europe , but at the same time I am terrified . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Well , I have acrophobia . I have a chronic fear of flying . __eou__ Oh really ? I have an uncle who is also terrified of flying . It ' s not that bad though , I mean , it is pretty scary to be in this big machine flying through the air at seven hundred miles per hour . I actually have arachnophobia . __eou__ You ' re scared of spiders ? I actually have two more phobias . Acrophobia and glossophobia . __eou__ I guess that explains why you are afraid of flying , but public speaking is not that bad . __eou__ Are you kidding ? When I get on stage , my palms start to sweat , I get really nervous and I can hardly speak . __eou__ Well , I must confess I am a bit claustrophobic . I hate being in an elevator for more than 5 seconds . __eou__ We are such weirdos right ? __eou__
Professor Wang , what is non-tariff barrier ? __eou__ Non-tariff barrier is another mean to restrict imports . __eou__ Can you give an example ? __eou__ For example , some countries restrict imports by quantitative restriction . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ This is used to protect local industries or to achieve certain political objectives . __eou__ Oh , Are there other means ? __eou__ Technical barriers are set for imported goods . __eou__ This is designed to exclude them from domestic market , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , some countries may use some of the unnecessary health rules to exclude foreign food . __eou__
What's holding us back on the plant expansion project ? We were supposed to see the specs on that ages ago.Why haven't I heard anything about it ? Did the whole project just vanish into thin air ? __eou__ No , sir . The plant expansion project has been delayed.There was a snag up in the fling process to get the necessary construction permits.It seems that the property we were slated to build on is also habitat for some endangered indigenous species . __eou__ You're joking , right ? No wonder we've been tied up with this project . I know the environmental impact statement will take forever to get approval if they've found anything endangered on the site . Are they positive there is evidence of endangered species actually living there ? __eou__ The environmental review board has a team on it now.Hopefully we'll know more by the end of the week . __eou__
Yes , madam ? Can I help you ? __eou__ Oh , yes , please . But you are just closing , aren't you ? __eou__ Well , yes , we are , madam . The shop shuts down in five minutes . __eou__ I shall not keep you long then . It was about some saucepans you had in your window last week . __eou__ Last week , madam ? I really can't remember which ones you mean . What were they like ? __eou__ Oh , they were lovely . Sort of imitation wood , dark brown color , country-style you know , and the lids , if I remember rightly , they had a sort of leaf pattern , or was it flowers ? __eou__ That's strange . I don't recognize any of the ones we had from that description . Are you sure they were in this shop ? __eou__ Oh , you must know the ones I mean . They were on sale , a real bargain . Reduced to a quarter of the original price . I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw them . __eou__ I am afraid the sales are over now , madam . And you know we all sold out of the saucepans . __eou__ I don't think you did , you know . My neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday . __eou__ Well , it's all new stock in the window now . __eou__ May I just have a look , to see if there is anything else ? __eou__ Eh , well , madam , as you know we are closing . __eou__ Yes , yes , I am sorry I won't keep you . It must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time . But they were such beautiful saucepans . I ’ d have bought them if I had made up my mind on the spot . __eou__ Perhaps madam , if you come back tomorrow , I could show you the whole range of kitchen ware . And there are still one or two things at the sale price . __eou__ Oh , look ! That was the one there . That is the sort of thing I was looking for . But it's not quite the color . __eou__ That might be the artificial lighting , madam . Of course , if you could come back in daylight , you might find it ’ s exactly what you are looking for . __eou__ There it is . That is the pattern ! The set behind you . Thank goodness , they haven't been sold . And thank you so much for being so patient with me . Yes , those are the ones . __eou__
Good morning . __eou__ Good morning . __eou__ What does the paper say ? __eou__ Nothing much — the same old stuff . A lot of bad news as usual . __eou__ Well , what ’ s the weather report ? __eou__ Sunny and mild today , cloudy and rainy tomorrow . __eou__ Did they find those bank robbers ? __eou__ Not yet . They were holding two men in Ohio , but they let them go . They weren ’ t the criminals after all . __eou__ What about the sports page ? What were the scores of last night ’ s games ? __eou__ Here ’ s the paper ; you can read them yourself . __eou__
What did you learn at the workshop you went to yesterday ? Do you think it was worth the investment to go ? __eou__ Yeah , I really got a lot of the session . The workshop topic was resolving personal problems . It was led by a professional human resources director . The teacher had a lot of experience , and I think we were all given a really good base to start with . __eou__ The workshop was only one afternoon long , do you really think you can learn that much in only a couple of hours ? __eou__ It depends on the topic , the teacher , and the way the course is set up . Yesterday , even though we only had a short time to discuss the issues , the workshop got us all thinking . We learned some very basic , but very useful methods of dealing with personnel issues . __eou__ Sounds like you really learned a lot . __eou__ I did ... I just hope I can implement all these great ideas that we shared . __eou__
Are the expressions of sight draft , time draft , usance draft and letter of credit adequate terms to express the different methods of payment ? __eou__ No . These terms need to be amplified . __eou__ What if the sale is made on the basis of sight draft ? __eou__ Then the shipping documents have to be attached . That way , both parties confirm the documents that will accompany the draft and constitute evidence of shipment in compliance with the contract terms . __eou__ Therefore , we must be very careful in building up clear expressions and complete understanding on both sides of trade . __eou__ Yes , that's very important . __eou__
OK , so are you ready to learn how to bake a cake ? __eou__ Almost , let me just put my apron on . __eou__ OK , so the first thing we are going to do is pre-heat the oven , that way we have it at the desired temperature once we finish preparing everything . Set it to three hundred and seventy five degrees Fahrenheit . __eou__ Got it . __eou__ No we are gonna make the batter . Take some butter and sugar and mix it lightly until you have a nice consistency . Then add some vanilla extract and eggs and continue mixing . __eou__ Do I have to use a whisk or can I use the electric mixer ? __eou__ Go ahead and use the mixer , but put it on medium speed . I'm gonna sift the flour and baking powder separately and then we can mix it with milk and the rest of the ingredients . __eou__ OK , so now we need a baking pan right ? __eou__ Yeah , but grease and flour it first so the cake won't stick to it when it bakes . __eou__ Done . So how long do we bake it for ? __eou__ We can leave it in there for about twenty five minutes . Then we let it cool for ten minutes before we remove the cake from the pan . __eou__ Wow ! This was a lot easier than I thought ! __eou__
Hello there , welcome to Wine World . Let me know if I can help you out at all . __eou__ Um , yes , please , I could really use some help . I'm going over to my boss'house for dinner tonight and don't know what kind of wine I should bring . __eou__ OK , do you know what kind of food will be served ? __eou__ Well , his wife is Japanese . He said she makes really good sushi . __eou__ Hmm , that's a bit of a challenge . Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine . Well , let's see . have to be a white wine , of course . __eou__ Why ? Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi ? __eou__ No , I don't think so . Sushi is a very delicately flavored food , and red wine would be a jarring contrast . You need a white wine , which has more subtle flavors , to complement the fish . __eou__ I see . So should I get a bottle of Chardonnay ? That's a white wine , right ? __eou__ Yes , Chardonnay is a white wine , but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet . Chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied whites , and tends to be a bit oaky . I'd suggest that you go for something brighter , like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand . __eou__ Sauvignon Blanc ? What's that ? __eou__ That's another varietal , or type of grape , just like Chardonnay . __eou__ Let's see . The label says it's got " attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp , mineral flavors and a bonedry finish . Serve chilled . " Oh , no , how long will it take to chill the wine ? I'm on my way to the dinner now . __eou__ It's OK , don't worry , we'll just choose a wine from the cooler . We don't have quite as extensive a selection over here , but ... this Rhone Valley white would be lovely . __eou__ All right . What varietal is that ? __eou__ Well , this is a French wine , so they don't always specify the varietal on the label . The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine . This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes , mostly Viognier , I'd guess . __eou__ And you think this is a good wine ? __eou__ Yes , this is one of our best-sellers . It's not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier , which means it's more approachable . It's light and crisp , with a bit of a vanilla aroma . __eou__ Perfect ! I'll take it ! __eou__
what do you hope to do when you finish university ? __eou__ I ’ d like to go into management . I ’ Ve applied for several jobs already and I ’ m hopeful that I ’ ll get some job offers . How about you ? __eou__ after I graduate , I have to do some more studies to pass exams to become a lawyer . I think I ’ Ve got a good chance of passing . There ’ s a possibility of getting a job with a law firm in London , provide __eou__ we both have to overcome several obstacles if we are to achieve our ambitions . __eou__ if life were easy , then we ’ d achieve our ambition quickly and then get bored . __eou__ unfortunately , it ’ s inevitable that some people are going to work hard yet not succeed . __eou__ that ’ s why ambition need to be realistic . You can ’ t achieve something that ’ s totally unrealistic . __eou__ as long as you plan carefully , most thing are possible . It ’ s always good to have a backup plan in case things go wrong . __eou__ I think it ’ s important to be successful in a field you are truly interested in , not something that other people force you to be interested it . __eou__ my father wanted me to become a doctor , but I knew it would be impossible for me to be successful in that field . __eou__ I hope my parents don ’ t try to interfere in my choice of career . __eou__
Good morning , sir . Are you Mr . Wang , the personnel manager ? __eou__ Good morning . Yes , I am . But I ’ m sorry I don ’ t think I know you . __eou__ No , you don ’ t . My name is Liu Lili . I got the information from the TV that your department wants to hire a clerk , who will work under you . I would like to apply for the job . __eou__ Oh , yes . We do have such a commercial . Sit down , please , Miss Liu . I ’ m glad to see you . Could you tell me about yourself first ? __eou__ OK . I ’ m 24 this year . I earned my college diploma from the Night College of Foreign Languages Institute in 2010 . My major is English . Recently I ’ Ve also earned my degree in Secretarial Technology . __eou__ Could you tell me about your work experience ? __eou__ Of course . I ’ Ve been working as an office clerk in the Textile Company since my graduation . I do a lot of things , such as typing , handling the daily correspondence , arranging meetings and so on . __eou__ Do you enjoy your work ? __eou__ To be frank , not very much , because I can ’ t use much what I ’ Ve learned in my work . I enjoy doing more challenging work . __eou__ Well , according to your experience , perhaps you could tell me what essential qualities a personnel department office clerk should maintain . __eou__ Of course . First of all , she must have a strong sense of responsibility . __eou__ Good . Go on , please . __eou__ She must be an honest person . __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ She must also be diligent and do a lot of things on her own initiative . __eou__ Good . The work includes keeping the files . Have you got any practical experience with that ? __eou__ Well , no . But I took related courses . I can gain experience quickly . I ’ m sure I can do the job well . __eou__
Shall we discuss the packing ? You know , a well-designed package helps sell the goods , so the products must not only be superior in quality , but also attractive in appearance . I'd like to see the sample of packing . __eou__ We have made a lot of improvement in packing . You are welcome to see the sample in the showroom . I think you will find the new packing beautiful and quite well-done . __eou__ Quite good . The beautiful design and bright color are just the European taste . How are you gonna pack these blouses ? __eou__ We are going to pack them in boxes with a colored picture of the blouse on it . Inside we ’ ll use a transparent poly bag for the blouse ready for the window show . You'll see that the blouses will appeal to the eye as well as to the purse . __eou__ Wonderful . __eou__
I'm so hungry ! I haven't late eaten all day ! __eou__ Take your mind off it . Look , Crys.This magazine is on China's top ten beauties ! __eou__ They're all so thin ! Her cheekbones are great . __eou__ She doesn't have an ounce of fat on her face . __eou__ The mag says she's 165 centimeters tall and 38 kilos .

Too much work . I hate to sweat . It's so gross . __eou__
Welcome back racing fans ! My name is Rick Fields and , as always , I am joined by my partner in crime , Bob Copeland . __eou__ We ’ re in the last stretch of this very exciting race , and Kimmi Rikknen is leading the pack with only four laps to go ! They are heading to turn three and Lewis Hamilton tries to pass Rikknen ! It ’ s a close one and , oh no ! Hamilton hits the wall ! __eou__ He came in too fast , jammed on the breaks and spun out . We have a yellow flag and the pace car is making its way onto the track . __eou__ The cleanup crew is towing the heavily damaged car and the green flag drops ! Rikknen is still in the lead with only two laps to go ! __eou__ Smoke is coming out of his car ! He seems to be having engine trouble ! He makes his way into the pit , and Fernando Alonso takes the lead ! __eou__ How unlucky for Rikknen , and this race is over ladies and gentlemen , Alonso takes the checkered flag ! __eou__
What's your little caper ? Come home so late ! We are all worried about you . __eou__ Oh , I am terribly sorry . But I was so captivated with the singer at the subway exit . So I forgot the time . __eou__ Singing ? At the subway exit ? Oh , it sounds like someone needs some money . __eou__ Oh , no , the guy was a musician who just sang . He played the guitar and sang so many cool pop songs . Many people were drawn to his music and there was no hat on the floor . He sang for appreciation , but not for money . __eou__ It is just pop song , you could have sung there too if you want it . __eou__ Oh , no , it was a kind of pop art . I like it but I couldn't do it that well . __eou__ Honey , just do it next time . Have you heard of the real art in the subway station in Russia ? __eou__ No , but tell me some . I am interested . __eou__ Many oil painting exhibitions are there . That is a kind of Museum Exhibition . __eou__ Are there many people there ? Do you think people actually like them ? __eou__ I am sure you will . There are some works , and some students who major in painting interpret the meaning for visitors . And people can enjoy the paintings while waiting for the train . __eou__ But I still prefer the pop music in the subway . __eou__ Both the pop music and the oil painting ate arts , but with different aesthetic values . __eou__ Dad , you talk well , but can you appreciate that kind of art ? __eou__ Not well enough , but I'm learning . __eou__
Welcome back , soccer fans . My name is Rick Fields and , as always , I am joined by my commentating wingman , Bob Copeland . __eou__ And we ’ re on the brink of soccer history today , as Ecuador and Brazil are tied one-one as we begin the second half of the 2022 World Cup ! __eou__ The ref calls the players for the kick off , and here we go ! Ecuador quickly passes the ball to the midfield , but , oath , it ’ s out of bounds . __eou__ That will be a throw in for Brazil . Adriano has the ball and makes a long pass to Robin , and the ref has called him offside . __eou__ No question about it . He was offside by a mile ! We have a goal kick for Ecuador . Edison Mendez heads it to Valencia , he shoots ! Deflected by the defender and we have a corner kick . __eou__ Delgado takes the corner . We have a foul ! Oh no , Did , the goalkeeper , has fouled the Ecuadorian player ! He gets a yellow card and that will be a penalty kick ! __eou__ This is the perfect opportunity for Ecuador to get ahead in this match and become World Champions ! He gets ready for the kick . He shoots ! and he ... __eou__
did you know that abortion is still illegal in many states in the USA ? __eou__ why ? I thought Americans were supposed to be more open than that . __eou__ well , for many religious people , they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers . __eou__ do you think most people in America believe that abortion is wrong ? __eou__ no , I think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions . __eou__ it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in America . __eou__ religious people blame it on pre-marital sex , not on abortion being illegal . __eou__ what do you think about abortion ? __eou__ I personally would never want to have one , but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself . __eou__ do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ? __eou__ I know this is going to sound sexist , but I don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children . __eou__ why not ? It's their children , too . __eou__ that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . Men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand . __eou__ that might be true , but I think men should have some kind of say in the matter . __eou__
Thank you for coming tonight , Mrs . Webber . As a teacher , it's great seeing the kid's parents assist our parent-teacher conference night . __eou__ Of course ! I am very interested to know how my child is doing and also get some insight from you as to how he can improve . __eou__ Well Allen is a great student . He is a hard worker and very well behaved , however he does struggle a bit with math . __eou__ I guess he gets that from me , I never did well in math when I was a kid . What can I do at home to compliment what he is learning in the classroom . __eou__ Well , it's important that you sit with him and review his homework assignments and help him with math . I would also recommend he stay after school twice a week for tutoring sessions . It will really help a lot . __eou__ Thanks a lot ! I will definitely do that . Is there anything else ? __eou__ Um ... yes . Here is a notice from our financial department , seems your child's Tumion is overdue . __eou__ Oh yes , I ... __eou__

It's perfect for you ! __eou__ Yeah ... I know . But I'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles ! __eou__ What kind of power struggles are you talking about ? __eou__ Basically , I think Tim is threatened by me . I'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career ! __eou__ So he talks about you behind your back ? __eou__ Yes . He's all nice and friendly to my face . But the second I turn around he stabs me in the back ! __eou__ I had a worker like that once . She was always taking credit for my ideas . __eou__ I should keep a better record of my correspondence with the clients so if necessary I can prove it was my effort . __eou__ My co-worker had a whole bunch of bad office habits . She liked to name-drop ... we would be in a meeting and she would say , yesterday I was chatting with Tom . She meant Tom Solomon ... our CEO . __eou__
When I was at school , I was quite good at track and field events . I was on the school team for the long jump , 100 and 200 meter sprints and the javelin . __eou__ Really ? I was quite good at the hurdles and the discus . __eou__ I wish that I were good at the discus , but I could rarely throw it in the right direction ! I was awful . With the hurdles , I could never jump over them ! __eou__ I thought you were good at the high jump ! __eou__ No , I was good at the long jump . I liked the sprints best . __eou__ Did you ever win any competitions ? __eou__ I was regional champion for the 100 and 200 meters . I usually did well in the dong jump competitions , but I couldn ’ t compete with kids from other schools in the javelin . How about you ? __eou__ I came second and third a few times in the regional championships , but I never won . Did you ever take part in the national championship for the sprinting events ? __eou__ Yes , I did , but I didn ’ t do very well . I made the final in both events , but came last . At least I made the final . I was very pleased with that . __eou__

I see by your resume that you have been working ? __eou__ Yes , I have worked for four years with a Canadian Company . __eou__ Tell me what you know about our company , please . __eou__ Well , Mark Smith , who was the first president , founded the company in Ottawa in 1955 . It has 1.5 billion dollars in capital.it employs 8,000 people , and it is the largest company in its field in Canada . __eou__ What do you know about our major products and our share of the market ? __eou__ Your company's products are mostly marketed in Canada and the United States , but particularly have sold very well here in China .

Anyhow , we'll contact you within this month . All right . Nice meeting you . Good-bye . __eou__ Nice meeting you , too . Good-bye . __eou__
I ’ Ve just looked over your resume and I must admit I am quite impressed . __eou__ Thank you . I ’ Ve worked pretty hard to be able to list those accomplishments . __eou__ You ’ Ve got plenty of training and experience . I wonder if you could tell me something about your goals . Where do you see yourself ten years from now ? __eou__ To be honest , I don ’ t plan in that much detail . My goals tend to be general ; I define success according to the job at hand . I see myself advancing as I succeed , but I don ’ t necessarily dwell on __eou__ interesting ! And how do you feel about decision-making ? Are you an independent thinker , or do you depend more on your superior for direction ? __eou__ That depends a bit on the problem at hand . There are certain situations in which a manager can give a general directive , and expect his employees to know how to take the initiative on the detail __eou__ Sounds good . Everyone is taking about teams these days . Can you describe your role as a member of a sales team ? __eou__ I see myself as an encourager . Of course , sales can be quite competitive and sometimes people in this field have a secret desire for others to fail . In my last job , each representative handled __eou__ So , your experience is as impressive in practice as it is on paper . __eou__
What else should we do now after the floors are done and after the furniture is in ? __eou__ We need to redo the curtains and paint all the walls and ceilings . __eou__ I'm the painter . You can be in charge of going to curtain shops to choose curtains . That will probably be pretty expensive too . Having good curtains made isn't cheap . __eou__ You mean we can't just buy curtains already made ? __eou__ Absolutely not . The windows must be measured , and then the curtains need to be made professionally . So that will take a while . Maybe a month or so . __eou__ While the curtains are being made , I can start having people look at the kitchen . I can't stand that old kitchen . I won't be able to cook there . I don't want to use that electric stove . __eou__ We need to find an interior decorating company to redecorate the kitchen . I believe in Portland there are shops that specialize in kitchen renovation . I will look in the Yellow Pages . I'd like a kitchen mostly in ivory and light green . __eou__ I agree . The colors must be soft and pleasant . You should feel comfortable when you cook our dinners . __eou__ Me ? Cook our dinners ? Hah ! You will be cooking , dear . You will cook . __eou__ No , I don't think so . I'll be too busy having tea in our new tea room . __eou__ Well , I suppose we'll have to hire a cook then . So you won't be able to afford any clothes next year . __eou__ And you'll have to sell your motorcycle . And your cameras . Right ? __eou__ Maybe I'll cook once or twice a week . How is that ? __eou__ Four times might be enough . Not once or twice . __eou__
May I help you , sir ? __eou__ Yes , I want to buy a VCR . __eou__ Well , we have many models to choose from here.Do you have a particular brand you want ? __eou__ No . I only want it to be a very good one . The best.It ' s a graduation gift for my son . __eou__ I see . And does your son have a VCR now ? __eou__ Well , he uses our VCR at home.But he's going to university in the Fall , so he needs his own VCR . __eou__ Does he watch a lot of movies ? __eou__ Yes , he sure does.In fact , he wants to become a movie producer himself.He wants to study film at the university . __eou__ I would like to make a suggestion then , sir . __eou__ Please do . __eou__ If your son wants to study film , probably he will start to collect movies himself . __eou__ Yes , I know that . So I want him to have a good VCR to use . __eou__ May I suggest you consider buying him a DVD player instead ? __eou__ DVD ? Isn't that like a CD ? __eou__ It is very similar . The technology is the same . __eou__ Why is a DVD better than a VCR ? __eou__ For one thing , sir , the quality of the image is usually better.That ' s because it's digital . __eou__ But isn't it more expensive ? __eou__ It is a little more expensive , sir.But there is one important advantage which your son might appreciate . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ If your son starts to buy video tapes , he can't keep them very long . __eou__ And why not ? __eou__ Video tape breaks down after fifteen years.So if he collects a lot of tapes , after fifteen years they will all start to rot . __eou__ Hmm . Is that true ? __eou__ Yes , it is , sir . __eou__ Well . And what about DVDs ? __eou__ This is the excellent thing about DVDs.If your son starts to collect DVDs , they will last forever . They will never rot . __eou__ Hmm . He might really appreciate that . I know he will start to collect movies at school . Especially if he studies film . __eou__ So let me show you some of our DVD players.In my opinion , DVD is the wave of the future . __eou__ Alright , please show me what you have . __eou__
People are funny . __eou__ They sure are . __eou__ Did you hear about the pilot ? __eou__ The one that stole a small plane ? __eou__ Yes , he stole a plane in Canada and flew into the U . S . __eou__ Did they catch him ? __eou__ Yes . After two U . S . fighter jets followed him for an hour , he landed on a highway . __eou__ Did he crash ? __eou__ No , he just landed the plane and walked to a restaurant . __eou__ Did the cops find out why he flew into the U . S . ? __eou__ His life sucked . He was hoping a fighter jet would shoot him down . __eou__ Poor guy . __eou__
Excuse me , sir . I am coming to apply for the position of accountant . __eou__ Oh , please sit down . What university did you graduate from ? __eou__ I graduated from Tianjin College of Commerce . __eou__ What was your major at college ? __eou__ My major was accounting . __eou__ Can you name some of the courses you completed in relation to accounting ? __eou__ Sure . I took such courses as accounting principles , commercial accounting , cost accounting , industrial accounting , electronic data processing accounting , and accounting involved in foreign capital enterprises . __eou__ What kind of work are you doing now ? __eou__ I'm engaged in accounting . __eou__ What are your responsibilities in your present work ? __eou__ My work involves various routine bookkeeping and basic accounting tasks including journal entries , verifying data and reconciling discrepancies , preparing detailed reports from raw data , and checking accounting documents for completeness , mathematical accuracy and consistency . __eou__ Are you familiar with the PRC Financial and Tax Regulations ? __eou__ I think so . __eou__ Can you tell me something about this balance sheet now ? __eou__ Of course . This balance sheet contains three major sections , that is , assets , liabilities and owner's equity . So , you see , the total current liabilities of your company are $ 3,372 , 000 , and the owner's equity is $ 5,400 , 000 . That means that the total assets , which is equal to the sum of the creditor's and the owner's equities , are $ 8,772 , 000 . __eou__ What's the creditor's equity ? __eou__ The creditor's equity is the same as liabilities . __eou__
Good afternoon ! Did you call for a plumber ? __eou__ Yes , yes I did . Please come in ! I ’ m so glad you came ! This old house is falling apart ! Come on into the bathroom . See , here , there ’ s water leaking everywhere ! __eou__ I see . Let me have a look . It seems that your toilet is clogged , and that ’ s why it won ’ t flush . Let me just get my plunger . No , that ’ s not working either . I suspect that there ’ s some sort of foreign object in the pipes that ‘ s causing a blockage . That ’ s what ’ s making your toilet overflow . __eou__ Oh , that must be because of my four-year-old daughter . She is always flushing things down the toilet . You know how kids are . __eou__ Yeah , I have a little one myself . Anyway , these water pipes are really rusty , so they also should be changed . Thatcould be causing water to not drain completely , that might lead to more problems in the future . I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn ’ t shutting off properly . I could have it all finished by today if it ’ s urgent . __eou__ That would be great ! Is it expensive ? __eou__ Let ’ s see ... I would say about eight hundred dollars . __eou__
Excuse me . Do you have a minute ? I'd like to tell you about the Bucky Card . __eou__ Well ... alright . I guess I have a minute . __eou__ Do you know about the Bucky Card ? __eou__ I've heard about it , but I don't really know about it . __eou__ The Bucky Card is a great way for you to save money while you have a good time here at school.It gives you discounts on all kinds of things . Movies , pizza , clothing , school supplies . __eou__ What about beer ? __eou__ The Card doesn't actually give you discounts on beer.But it will give you discounts on certain club cover charges.So if you want to see your favorite band at Amy's or Cosmo's Club , you get a discount on the entrance fee . __eou__ That's pretty cool . How much of a discount ? __eou__ Usually it's two dollars off the cover price . __eou__ And all these other things , pizza and movies for instance--how much of a discount do I get on that stuff ? __eou__ This pamphlet shows you what restaurants and movie theaters have discounts.And twice every semester we will send you a new issue of the pamphlet.The Bucky Card has just started.Every couple months we have new businesses joining our program.It ' s a great way for students to save money ! __eou__ Alright , alright . Let me look at that pamphlet.Hmm . Alessio's Pizza Parlor . That's cool . I go there all the time.And Cosmo's Club . And 4 - D records . Alright . How much does it cost ? __eou__ It costs only 19 dollars a year for a card . __eou__ Whoa ! That's expensive ! It should be cheaper . __eou__ But think of how much money you'll save ! You can use it for a year . __eou__ Yeah , maybe . Alright . Give me an application form . __eou__
Mr . Smith , I'm wondering whether you have found a way of considering my offer ? __eou__ I certainly have the will but I wonder if I've found the way . __eou__ You see . I made what I consider to be a reasonable offerbased upon the rise in production costs and the continued fall in the exchange rate of Australian Dollar to U . S . Dollar . __eou__ Let me say something about the falling Australian Dollar . We're both hurt by the rising U . S . Dollar . We will have to pay more Renminbi for U . S . Dollar to buy wool from you . __eou__ I understand . __eou__ Do you ? Then you can see that we have one wish that is to conclude this transaction in a way that will satisfy both sides . What can you do to help ? __eou__ I think the best way I can do is to reduce our price by 2 % and I should think we could conclude a deal at $ 98 . __eou__ All right . I accept this reduced offer at $ 98 per metric ton FOB stowed . The other terms and conditions shall remain the same as those in the previous agreement . Now will you draft the agreement or shall I ? __eou__ Your legal department is very good at these things . We can trust them with the drafting of the agreement . __eou__ Ok . Then well bring it over to you tomorrow morning . You'll sign it first , so it will only need my signature . Is that agreeable to you ? __eou__ Very agreeable , Mr . Smith . It will only take me a minute to sign it and send it back to you . __eou__ Good . Let's shake hands on this successful transaction . __eou__
Your tree looks beautiful . Do you decorate it this way every year ? __eou__ Yes , it's a family tradition dating back to my childhood . We use the same lights and ornaments , but of course we have a new tree each year.The children made some of these decorations . Here , you can hang this on one of those high branches . __eou__ Well , everything seems to be just about ready . Now all we need is snow.Do you exchange the presents in the morning ? __eou__ Oh , yes . The kids are too excited to wait . After we clean up the mess all the empty boxes and the wrapping paper we have a big breakfast . Then the kids have the whole day to play with their new toys . __eou__ And we'll have a great turkey dinner at around four o'clock . My brother and his family will be joining us . I look forward to meeting them . Well , it's late , so I'll say good night . I'll see you early tomorrow , so I can share your Christmas morning.Good night ! __eou__
Don't you feel a little strange taking the place of your old boss after he was demoted ? __eou__ Yes , at first I felt very awkward . After Bill was demoted and then resigned , it was kind of like somebody died ! I mean the atmosphere in the office was like a funeral parlor or something . And then I was afraid people would look at me as a traitor for filling in his spot when the management asked me to ... __eou__ Did they mutiny ? __eou__ Thankful , no . I guess everyone understands the opportunity I had to step into a leadership role is so great for my career . I'm really moving up the ladder now that I'm considered a supervisor . After a couple weeks , it was like nothing happened . __eou__ It is a really good chance for you to get more exposure at work . supervisors get to take the credit for all the hard work of the people under them . __eou__ Yeah , and they also take the blame , that's what happened to my old boss ... __eou__
Tell me about yourself and your past experience . __eou__ I have worked as an executive secretary for 5 years , first for trading companies , and now I am working for a trust company . I interact well with peers , clients , administrators and bosses . I thrive on challenge and work well in high-stress environments . __eou__ How are your typing and shorthand skills ? __eou__ I can type 100 Chinese words a minute and take dictation in English at 150 words a minute . __eou__ Can you operate computers skillfully ? __eou__ Yes , I can . I have received some special training in computers . Besides I am good at operating common office machines , such as fax machines and duplicating machines . __eou__ Sometimes we are very busy and need to work overtime . How do you feel about that ? __eou__ That's all right . But could you tell me how often and how many hours I should work overtime ? __eou__ It just depends . If we have important visiting delegations , you have to stay with us . It's not unusual . __eou__ Mr . Smith , I's like to ask you a question . __eou__ OK , please . __eou__ What specific duties would I perform if I am hired ? __eou__ Nothing different from a secretary's common responsibilities . However , you know , our company is an international trade-oriented company , can you handle English papers and write English correspondence ? __eou__ Yes . I specialized in English secretary studies at college and that's one of the main parts of my present job . __eou__ What are your salary expectations ? __eou__ I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . Maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position . __eou__ The starting monthly salary would be ¥ 2,000 , with rises after the half year according to your competence . __eou__ I think it's acceptable and I really like the job . And when can I know the decision ? __eou__ We'll inform you of our final decision by early July . Do you have any other questions ? __eou__ No . Thank you for the time . __eou__
Did you watch TV last night , Rose ? __eou__ Yeah . I saw a science program . It was quite interesting . __eou__ What was it about ? __eou__ Mars . Scientists say there might be water on it . __eou__ If so , we may live there someday . __eou__ I hope so . Did you know the US successfully sent two robotic explorers to Mars last month ? __eou__ Sure . I heard about this on the TV . On January 3rd , 2004 , Explorer Spirit landed near the so-called Guser Crater . And three weeks later , Spirit's twin explorer , Opportunity , landed on Meridian Planum named by scientists . __eou__ Yes . Both have sent back pictures of the planet . And the latter did a better job . __eou__
You like movies ? __eou__ Yeah , I think it's the best way to relax . __eou__ What type do you like the best ? __eou__ Really it depends on my mood . When I am sad or depressed , I like comedies . If I'm feeling good , I'll watch almost anything . __eou__ I see . I generally like movies to help calm me down . I think a sign of a good movie is the ability to bring you into the story as if you were part of it . __eou__ Yeah , unfortunately , nowadays directors are often more interested in making money than making a good film . __eou__ True . The movie industry is becoming more and more commercial . You see a lot of expensive movies with little artistic value . I generally think those made in the forties are of higher quality on the average than movies today . You can name a lot of classics from that decade . __eou__ Yeah , many of my all-time-favorites were made in the forties . They've already stood the test of time and will stay with us for a long time . __eou__ I'm totally with you on that . __eou__
Come back . You haven't paid yet . __eou__ May , just let him go . __eou__ But he took some newspaper away without paying . __eou__ I know . __eou__ Why ? You make me confused . __eou__ He lives nearby and he would just glance at the newspaper headlines , read the political sections and return them later . __eou__ Why does he have such a privilege ? __eou__ He used to be a hero during the war time and everyone respect him . __eou__ I see . Does he live by himself ? __eou__ Yes , he has no children and his wife passed away when he was in the battle . __eou__ He must be lonely ? __eou__ I bet . But he is always busy telling the children stories . __eou__ How respectable ! __eou__
I can't believe you wear jeans to the office ! Are you trying to lose your job ? __eou__ Of course not . I'm just observing casual day . On Fridays , the company doesn't require us to wear formal business attire . __eou__ Wow ! Nobody told me about that . Won't the relaxed dress code damage the company image ? __eou__ We don't think so . Casual days are becoming more common , and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes . __eou__ I guess it lets people express their individual tastes . But won't some people abuse it ? __eou__ Not really . Besides , there is a separate dress code for casual day . People can't just wear whatever they want . __eou__ It seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity . __eou__ Believe it or not , it has the opposite effect . Employees are actually more productive on casual days . __eou__
So , tell me , what makes you think we should give you a raise ? __eou__ I've got several good reasons . I've been here several years , my work has proven to be good , and I've noticed that people in comparable jobs get paid more than I do . __eou__ Salaries are confidential , how do you know how much money these " other people " make ? __eou__ Well , I've noticed all the new cars around here , for one thing . __eou__ Those are company cars provided to the sales staff for their business trips . Also , some employees receive sales commissions . So good salesmen will naturally earn more . __eou__ That's understandable . Well , rather than comparing my salary with someone else's , perhaps we could talk about my job performance . Surely you've noticed the extra hours I've put in recently ? __eou__ I see your point . However , it might be hard to get a raise approved . Profits were down last quarter , and the whole company is tightening its belt , so anything that affects the annual budget __eou__ That would be very good of you , Mr . White . __eou__
Have you ever tried shopping online ? __eou__ No , never . I prefer to actually see and touch what I'm buying before I pay for it , especially for clothes and shoes . __eou__ That's right . Seeing is believing . __eou__ I've heard some friends say when they get the article , it's quite different from what they see on the website advertisement . __eou__ That happens . Without close quality examination , we may encounter fraud , and the e-shop may suddenly disappear . __eou__ What's more , it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password . __eou__ It's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem . Paying online is much safer than before , but I still have the feeling that it's not safe enough . __eou__ I can't agree more . that's why I only do street shopping . __eou__ Me too . Sometimes I surf online shops to check some related information , and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping . __eou__ That's a good idea . __eou__
It's my first visit to Prague , I'll be here for three days for a conference , then I have a day on my own to do some sightseeing before I head back home . What do you suggest I see when I'm here ? __eou__ There are many interesting places you should be sure to see . One problem is transportation , however . Because the city is very old , the roads are narrow and congested . If you only have three or four days to visit , you don't want to spend them waiting in traffic in a cab . I suggest you take the subway . __eou__ The subway ? But is there a subway station next to my hotel ? I have to go between the conference center and the hotel several times a day ... __eou__ No worries , there's a subway station at the conference center itself , and a shuttle from your hotel to the conference center that takes only 5 minutes . When you do your personal sightseeing , you can first take the shuttle to the conference center , then hop on the metro . __eou__ Is it expensive to ride on the underground ? __eou__ You can get a daily pass that will allow you to travel unlimited for the whole day for about 6 dollars . Otherwise , you can pay by trip , which is about 50 cents to 2 dollars each trip , depending on how far you go . __eou__ Is it easy to get lost ? __eou__ No , no ... . it's very hard to get lost . There are two lines , one that goes in a circle , the other that is straight . If you get lost , there are always subway attendants that can help you find your way . __eou__
Hi , Tony . Haven ’ t seen you for a long time . How have you been ? __eou__ OK , I ’ Ve been looking for a job for days , and I haven ’ t found one yet . It's so hard finding work these days . Have you had any luck ? __eou__ Yes , I've got a job , a waiter's job in a restaurant . __eou__ Are you well paid ? __eou__ Well , $ 10 per hour , but I can keep the tips . That comes to roughly $ 80 every evening __eou__ Not bad . __eou__ Actually , there's still another opening . If you are interested , you ’ ll surely get it . __eou__ That ’ s great ! I ’ ll go there right now and speak with the boss . __eou__ There ’ s no rush . You can see him tomorrow . I ’ Ve told him about you . He promised to give you the job . __eou__ That was nice of you , Susan . Thanks a lot . __eou__ Think nothing of it , Tony . I ’ m sure you ’ d do the same for me . __eou__ Could you tell me a bit more about the work there ? I mean , those dos and don'ts . I am a green hand , you know . __eou__ First of all , you must be punctual . You should be there before 6 p . m . so that you will have half an hour for preparation changing clothes and things like that . Then , remember you should smile . Smile to your customers all the time . Never pull a long face even If you feel awful that day . Anything else ? Oh , yes . Never argue with your boss . Learn to say ' Yes , sir . ' __eou__ Be a yes-man , you mean ? __eou__ You may put it that way if you like . Don ’ t worry . You ’ ll have no problem . __eou__ I hope not . __eou__
Thank you.Steven.That was the most magnificent meal I've had abroad.You ' ll have to let me reciprocate the next time you're in Beijing . __eou__ Don't worry about it , Lin.That ' s no big deal.You know , Americans appreciate China's rich culinary culture . Just excuse me for a second while I check the number here and figure out how much to give the waiter.Hmm , by the way , what do you do about tipping in China ? __eou__ We don't . __eou__ No tipping ? Now that's what I call a civilized system . __eou__ At hotels and some restaurants they add a service charge to the bill , but other than that , tipping isn't customary . __eou__ What about cab drivers and porters ? __eou__ In a cab you just pay what it says on the meter . I generally tip hotel porters 10 yuan per bag , but in first-class hotels they're instructed not to accept gratuities . __eou__ You'd have a revolution on your hands if you tried to introduce that sort of system here . __eou__
For our lunch meeting with the investors , do we have to make a reservation at the restaurant or do we just show up ? __eou__ Usually for lunch , we don't have to reserve a table , they should allow walk-ins . But to be on the safe side , I'll order a table for half-past twelve . Will that suit your schedule ? __eou__ I've arranged to meet them at the restaurant at twelve . Can you make the reservation a little earlier ? If we start earlier , it will give us more time for a longer lunch . __eou__ Are you planning on treating the investors to a full-course meal ? __eou__ Yes , we'll start with appetizers , follow with a soup and salad course , then main dishes of prime rib or cordon bleu chicken , and finish up with a delicious rich dessert of some sort . __eou__ That'll be pretty heavy for a mid-day meal , don't you think ? __eou__ As along as we stay away from anything alcoholic , we should be okay . __eou__ With your prime rib and chicken choices , you'd better hope nobody's vegetarian . __eou__ We can make some special arrangement if we need to . After all , it's the company who is footing the bill . __eou__
I remember you said that you like China because it has cheap beers . __eou__ Yes , unbelievably cheap . Carlsborg is less than $ 1 . __eou__ Why do you drink ? I mean , where does drinking get you ? __eou__ It's fashionable . __eou__ Come on , you don't even know that blinds following is a sign of immaturity . __eou__ Mary , it's not about the blind following . What matter is I enjoy in drinking . It's like when you get off of work . You're so tired . You need to get relaxed . You can't just turn on the TV and keep watch the programs until you fall asleep . You need to make your after work time more fun . __eou__ How ? By drinking ? __eou__ Drinking is just part of it . I mean , you have a bunch of friends coming by and having fun . You drink and talk . And the more you drink , the more you talk . It makes me so relaxed . __eou__ When did you begin to drink ? __eou__ It's a long time ago . When I first went to a bar to pick up girls there , I saw the most beautiful girl sitting and sipping a coke . Then I went up to her and said ' can I buy you a drink ? ' __eou__ And then ? __eou__ Then I talked to her and got her number . You know what ? When you don't know what to say ? Just drink . __eou__ So you get drunk every day ? __eou__
Hello Michael . __eou__ Hello Todd . __eou__ We're going to talk about Australia . Or your going to talk about Australia . So first of all how any people live in Australia ? __eou__ Australia ? Oh , there's about twenty million people in Australia right now . A little bit under , but close to twenty . __eou__ OK . What are the biggest cities ? __eou__ The biggest city ? The biggest city is Sydney , then it's followed by Melbourne and then Brisbane and then I think it's Perth . But most of the big cities are on the East Coast of Australia . And Perth is on the west coast , but sort of of out there by itself . __eou__ OK . Um , if you had to live in one place where would you live ? __eou__ I like Brisbane . I had my teenage years in Brisbane , growing up in Brisbane , um or maybe Sidney because it is a big city , but Brisbane has got the gold coast and the sunshine . __eou__ Oh , nice . Actually , what is the capital city of Australia ? __eou__ Ah , Canberra is the capital city . But is not the biggest city . Sydney is the biggest city . Canberra was made sort of by the politicians so Sydney wouldn't get to crowded . It's a separate territory . __eou__
How many people are there in your family ? __eou__ There are 15 people in my family . __eou__ What did you say ? How many ? __eou__ 15 people . __eou__ Wow . That is a very big family . Do you all live together ? __eou__ Of course we do ! My father's parents , Mum , Dad , three unmarried aunts , two uncles , my two brothers , my three sisters and me . __eou__ But you don't live at home anymore . __eou__ Right , but that's where my heart is . But you're right , now there are only 14 living at home . __eou__ My goodness ! Your family must live in a huge house . __eou__ Yes . My family lives in rural Korea , near Pusan . We have a huge house.The first floor of the house is a part-time private school.In the afternoon , students come for special tutoring in biology , Englis __eou__ Wow ! you grew up in a school ! No wonder your English is excellent ! __eou__ My aunts and uncles are all teachers . __eou__ You are so lucky ! __eou__ I guess so . While growing up , I read hundreds of interesting English storybooks every year . __eou__ That's what i did in America . I was reading all the time . I was never a big TV watcher . TV wastes time . __eou__ I agree . Reading for fun is why all the English students at our family school have excellent English . All the students read 800 easy storybooks during their second year of studying English . __eou__ 800 books ? I'm impressed ! __eou__ My aunts studied in the American universities.They say that extensive reading for fun is the most effective way to improve your English.That ' s what they learn here in America . __eou__
what do you do when you see a homeless person on the streets begging for money ? __eou__ I never really give them money because I don't want to contribute to their addictions . __eou__ homeless youth can easily become involved with drugs and prostitution . Do you do anything to help them ? __eou__ I usually ask them if they want some food and then give them something to eat . I figure that if they're homeless , they're probably hungry . __eou__ that's a good idea . Do they usually accept the food ? __eou__ almost always . However , sometimes they get mad at me for not giving them any cash . __eou__ it's sad how more and more young people are sleeping on the streets in London now . __eou__ the cost of living in London is just too high for most people . __eou__ it's true . The economy is in a bit of mess at the moment . __eou__ did you know that few people can pay the rent on minimum wage , let alone pay for food and other living costs ? __eou__ there just isn't enough affordable housing to go around . If only the housing cost would drop , fewer people would be in financial trouble . __eou__ added to that is the high unemployment rate right now . __eou__ something's got to change---and it's got to happen soon . __eou__ politicians like to ignore the problems of the working class . They like to focus on making life easier for the upper class . __eou__ I can only hope that one day they will change . __eou__
Last week , we had a performance review on all the staff in our department in last quarter . Stevens , can you provide more information about the performance review ? __eou__ Yes , sir . Most of us had positive review in last quarter . Take Fred and David for examples . Both of them try their best to achieve the best . Their progress is distinct , especially in last quarter . __eou__ They are popular in and out of our department . Fred is easygoing , while David is cautious in working . __eou__ All these say a lot for their characters . __eou__ So , I want to recommend them for a raise . Fred is promoted to be the assistant of manager in marketing department and David to be director of office . __eou__
OK , folks , let's get to work . We need to come up with some ideas for the new essentials perfume campaign . This is a really big contract and we are under a lot of pressure here to impress the client . __eou__ Well , Let's get down to business ( shall we ? ) Now is probably a good time to start our discussion , the main purpose of this meeting is to talk about the benefits and disadvantages of our new project . __eou__ The reason I have called this meeting is to review a proposal we have received from our international division in Hong Kong . The agenda for this meeting is as follows , first , a presentation of the new proposal by Mr . Black . Second , an analysis by Ms . Nielson . Finally , a discussion about whether or not to implement this proposal . __eou__
Confronted with difficult questions in an interview , the job-hunters mostly will be at a loss about what to do . __eou__ Usually , you cannot prepare for these questions in advance and have to depend on your immediate performance . __eou__ Still , there are some rules to follow . __eou__ In this case , you should first keep calm and normal to the face . __eou__ Don't get nervous and freaked out . __eou__ Formulate a satisfactory answer based on your specific situation . __eou__ There should be neither too much silence nor hasty answers __eou__ Try to show the best of yourself with decent words and manners . __eou__ Don't be discouraged even when confronted with negative questions __eou__ You should admit your weakness frankly . __eou__ Anyway , what really matters is that you have tried your best . __eou__ You must have confidence in yourself . __eou__
My friend Emily recently lost 18 pounds . __eou__ Oh , really ? __eou__ The point is that she has been persuading me to lose weight too . __eou__ Well , it's a good thing for you . __eou__ Good ? Yes , it's good for her but not for me . You see , she tells me that I'll feel better about myself if I slim down . She keeps giving me newspaper clippings about the latest miracle diet and insists that I join a health club , as she has . __eou__ So you don't think you are fat and need to lose weight ? __eou__ I just can't bear it that Emily made me feel like a baby who always pigs out on junk food . __eou__ junk food is not good for your health . Too much of it will make you fat . __eou__ But junk food is so easy . It requires no silverware or plates , no rigid mealtimes , no pleases and thank yous . __eou__ Ok , but junk food has many disadvantages . As junk food contains high amount of oil and fat , you'll feel sleepy , but not be able to concentrate when you have a lot of it . __eou__ Yes , but life without chips , ice cream and coca cola is boring . __eou__ Let me see . You could exercise more to keep fit . __eou__ Well , that sounds better than giving it up . __eou__
So that concludes the introduction . Now let's move to the first part of my talk , which is about 2006 fiscal year marketing plan . So first , right off the bat , When looking at the marketing plan , tell me some of the goals that we had set this year to begin with ... __eou__ We wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also , in line with that goal , redo our image ... __eou__ That's correct . If you remember , we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets . Now , when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals , there are three things to consider . First , the original condition of the market , second , our marketing numbers from the previous year , and third , our final sales figures for this year . Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts . If you look at the overhead , you'll see a graph ... The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005 , the red line is the sales in 2006 ... As you can see , our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with , but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year . On the other hand , you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket . __eou__
Well , Yuri , tell me about it . __eou__ I'm sorry I can't bring better news , sir . The site is a disaster . __eou__ That's what I was afraid of . __eou__ It is not only the earthquake , sir . But the mudslides.Much of the north half of the site has been covered over by mud . __eou__ Mud ? But Ivan told me there were no mudslides in that district . I thought all the mudslides were down in Chichitango . __eou__ That's what we thought , sir . That's what the news reported.But there was one little mudslide in our district too . Right above our site . __eou__ Oh , that's terrible ! What bad luck ! I wish we had never come to this country.But , if it isn't the strikes and the revolutionaries , it's the earthquakes.Our operations here are finished ! __eou__ I'm sorry , sir . __eou__ It's not your fault , Yuri.But tell me . When will Ivan be able to get out there ? __eou__ Well , it took me about nine hours to get back here by car.If Ivan leaves tonight , I think he should be there by tomorrow lunch . __eou__ Good . I want an estimate of damages as soon as possible . __eou__ But sir ... __eou__ Yes , Yuri ? __eou__ I wouldn't recommend sending Ivan now.Especially not at night . The roads aren't safe . __eou__ Has the earthquake damaged the bridges too ? __eou__ No , sir . The bridges are fine.But I've heard rumors that the revolutionaries are coming down from the mountains.There has been fighting , sir . __eou__ Are you serious ? Fighting ? But I didn't hear anything on the news . __eou__ You know the government controls the press here , sir . They don't want it reported . __eou__ Oh , this is terrible , Yuri . Terrible ! So we can't even assess the damages . How can we do business in this country ? Either we're buried under mud , or we're in danger of getting kidnapped.No , I can't believe this mess ! __eou__ I'm sorry , sir . __eou__ You don't have to keep saying that , Yuri . It's not your fault.But me--I'm the one who should be sorry.It was me who suggested operations here in the first place ! Oh , what can we do ? __eou__
Hey Sarah , are you all right ? You look upset . __eou__ As a matter of fact , I am a bit upset . I just came out of a meeting and it didn't go very well . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ No one would listen to any of my suggestions . Instead , they just kept arguing with each other . __eou__ Who was chairing the meeting ? __eou__ Bob . __eou__ Well , I can tell you from experience that Bob might come off a little strong sometimes . __eou__ That's exactly what happened ! He kept interrupting everyone with his own suggestions and did not want to hear what others had to say . Then he expected everyone to agree with him . __eou__ What was the meeting about ? __eou__ We were trying to come up with ideas to streamline the office's workflow to make it more efficient . __eou__ It's ironic that the meeting was anything but efficient . __eou__ Exactly . I had tons of ideas that I wanted to share , but they just wouldn't let me finish . What should I have done to get my point across ? __eou__ You have to keep things short and sweet . When you get a chance to speak , try not to get into too many unnecessary details . __eou__ Short and sweet ? But what if I have to explain something complicated ? __eou__ You can always bring up the main points during the meeting and speak to those who are directly involved after the meeting . Not everyone needs to know all that information . __eou__ That's a good idea , I think I will try that at the next meeting . __eou__
How time flies ! We have been in Beijing for almost 4 years . __eou__ yes , I can still recall the days when we were all seniors at college . I asked you whether you would go back to your hometown or not . __eou__ yeah , feels like yesterday . Now I ’ m almost settled down here . We ’ re planning to buy an apartment and tie the knot . __eou__ congratulations ! I hope when you hold the wedding ceremony , I ’ m still residing in Beijing . __eou__ thank you . Is your company going to move to other cities ? __eou__ no , I ’ m planning to quit this job and go back to work in my hometown after the spring festival . __eou__ why is that ? __eou__ well , I still can ’ t adjust to the fast pace of city life . __eou__ yeah , the hustle and bustle is really difficult to handle . __eou__ that ’ s right . I work extremely hard , and try my best to adapt to the lifestyle here , but I don ’ t feel any sense of belonging here . __eou__ I understand your position . Perhaps it ’ s time to stop floating and go back to where you belong . You ’ ll feel much better with your family around . __eou__ yeah , I think so . __eou__
Is this the Friendship Hospital ? Please send an ambulance to 68 Hu Nan Road . __eou__ Is it urgent ? Our ambulances are not enough to meet every call . __eou__ Of course . It's urgent . I think the partie nt is suffering from acute appendicitis . He may die if not treated in time . __eou__ All right , we'll come right away . __eou__ ( after a while ... ) Where's the patient ? __eou__ He's there in the room . He's very ill . __eou__ Don't worry . We'll put him in the stretcher . You are coming with us ? Step in please . __eou__ Carry him into the emergency ward . Here we are . __eou__ Help the patient bathe and change his clothes , nurse . Then bring him into the operating room . __eou__ ( after a while ... ) I'm his guide . What's the trouble with him , doctor __eou__ He had appendicitis , but is all right now that it was removed . He'll have to rest for a few weeks to recover . __eou__ May I send food for him ? __eou__ No , outside food is not permitted . __eou__ Can I come round to see him tomorrow ? __eou__ Yes . But first you must observe the visiting hours , It's from 2 to 5 p . m . By the way , consult the nurse before you enter the ward . __eou__ Yes . Thank you . __eou__ By the way , you can bring some flowers . __eou__ OK . __eou__ Don't worry about him . __eou__ When could I take care of him ? __eou__ Our nurse can take good care of him . __eou__
Professor Wang looks so handsome today . He is wearing a light brown suit and a pink tie . __eou__ He always wears an extremely becoming suit with tie . __eou__ He ’ s quite particular about what he wears , especially about his ties . He gets different tie each day . __eou__ A light brown suit and a pink tie today , and a light blue shirt and a blue tie yesterday . A perfect match ! __eou__ The tie is necessary for man . It makes you look so attractive in a super tie . __eou__ Match is important ; well , the way of tying is also important . __eou__ My father dose not know how to tie a tie , for he often wears a cravat . __eou__ My father wears a tie every day , but he can ’ t do it himself . My mother helps him with his tie every morning . __eou__ You mother is not only a patient mother but also a gentle wife . __eou__
How do you think the transport system in our city could be improved ? __eou__ I think that the public transport system could be made simpler . I never know where the bus routes actually go . The routes seem to twist and turn rather than going roughly in a straight line . __eou__ I think we just need to build more roads . Then there would be more space for cars to drive and we ’ d have fewer traffic jams . __eou__ If we built more roads , people would just fill them with cars again . I think we should discourage people from using their cars . __eou__ How would you do that ? __eou__ I think we should do a few things at once . Improving public transport would encourage people to use that . If we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre , they won ’ t use their cars as much . __eou__ I don ’ t know . I think it ’ s unfair to make drivers pay more money . They already pay a lot of tax-petrol tax , for example . __eou__ I think that they should pay more tax . Look at the damage they cause to the environment and people ’ s health by discharging all those exhaust fumes . __eou__ The air would certainly be cleaner if there were fewer cars being used in the city . The problem is that people will see it as reducing their freedom . It well be unpopular . __eou__ That ’ s a good point . Car owners will probably be against it , but people who use public transport will be in favor of it . __eou__
The environment varies greatly because of difference in language , customs and traditions . __eou__ Yes . This gap can be filled by export market research before exporting . __eou__ But the importance of the export research is often neglected by the managers . __eou__ That's right . They do not appreciate its value and consider it to be a luxury . __eou__ Therefore , when enterprises are spending a lot of money in trying to penetrate a new market , they should research whether their products can be sold at high enough a price and in a satisfactory amount . __eou__ Exactly ! __eou__
Hello Mr . Jones , please have a seat . Thank you for coming in today . I have read your resume . You completed University in England ? __eou__ Yes , I went to Cambridge . After graduation , I started right away into the advertising industry . Later , I made a bit of a switch to focus on marketing research . __eou__ So , what experience do you have ? __eou__ I have ten years marketing experience . This includes both entry level and management positions . In my last position , I worked my way up to being director of the marking department . __eou__ I can see that from your resume.Your last position was marketing director for a pharmaceutical company , is that right ? Later , why did you decide to leave your former post ? __eou__ I felt after five years in one place , I was ready for something new . I would like to have a job that is challenging , something that I can see and do new things every day . I loved many things about my former job , and I left with amiable feelings on both sides . I was just ready for something new . __eou__ I see . Do you want to work full-time or part-time ? __eou__ I would rather work full-time . __eou__ I'll make note of that . Now , what are your salary expectations ? __eou__ I am willing to negotiate , but I expect at least $ 40,000 a year . __eou__
Good evening Ms . Jackson . Fancy meeting ’ you here . __eou__ Hi , Clyde . This is my friend , Wen . She's visiting from UCLA . __eou__ Clyde Smith . Pleasure to meet you . May I treat you ladies to dinner ? __eou__ OK ! I was just tellin ’ Wen about African-American food . __eou__ You weren't going to tell her about chitterlings and hog maws , were you ? Well , my Creole ancestors never ate that stuff . We have refined French tastes . __eou__ Hey ! That “ stuff ” is my grandma's cooking , and it's good ! __eou__
My disposable contact lenses . They're great for camping ! __eou__ Cool ! Each contact comes in its own saline solution ? __eou__ Yep . They're prescription contacts with UV protection . __eou__ Wow ! How high-class ... a new pair for each day ... __eou__ You just pop'em in in the morning , take them out at night , and then throw them away . No cleaning ! __eou__ Cool . So are you near-sighted or far-sighted ? __eou__ Near sighted . __eou__
What does Human Resources Department do ? __eou__ Hiring , firing , training , insurances , benefits , retirement plans , salary , vacation . __eou__ They take care of a lot of things . __eou__ But most of time , they provide assistances . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Say if the Engineering Department wants to hire a person , they will request HR to find candidates . __eou__ Yes ? __eou__ The Engineering Manager and his team will interview the candidates . HR will also be involved with the interview , but basically arranging the schedule and explaining the benefits . __eou__ OK . __eou__ Then the Engineering Manager will choose the candidate . __eou__ I see . __eou__
Here's our sample room . __eou__ You've got a large collection of sample foodstuffs here . __eou__ Yes . We are exporting a wide range of foodstuffs to many countries . And the demand is getting greater and greater.By the way , which items are you interested in ? __eou__ I'm particularly interested in shortbreads . Do you have some samples you could show me ? __eou__ Yes . This way , please . Our shortbread is in a variety of flavors , such as almond , walnut , lotus seed , etc . And different packaging has different weights . We can make packages within a reasonable range of any size you require . __eou__ The small sizes are more marketable than the large ones for us . I wonder if Your pastry tastes better . __eou__ You are welcome to have a try . Here it is . Ours is of prime quality . __eou__ Oh , it's delicious ... __eou__
John , I'd like to see you in my office for a minute . __eou__ Yes , sir , I'll be there in just a moment . __eou__ John , I have been watching you . I've been paying attention to you over the last quarter and I'm impressed . You've done a tremendous job in tackling some difficult accounts . I just want to let you to know , after this month's performance reviews , I'm recommending you for promotion . __eou__ Gosh sir , thank you , sir ! I had no idea there were any positions opening up in our department . __eou__ Well , it's not going to be in our department . I've recommended you for an interdepartmental transfer . There's supervisory spot opening up in financial . I'm turning your name in for it . __eou__ Management ? Wow , I had no idea I could move so quickly from entry level to managerial staff . __eou__ You've earned it . __eou__
Veronica ! Veronica ! Veronica ! Are you OK ? __eou__ Steven ! What ’ s going on ! Who were those guys ? I didn ’ t know you have a gun ! What ’ s going on ! __eou__ I will come clean as soon as we get to safety , OK ? For now , you have to trust me , please ! I would never do anything to hurt you . __eou__ Steven , I ... __eou__ I haven ’ t been completely honest with you Veronica , I ’ m sorry . I ’ m not a fireman . I ’ m not even from the United States . I ’ m a spy for the Indian government . __eou__ What ? Why didn ’ t you tell me before ? What are you doing here ? __eou__ When I was a young boy , I used to play cricket my father back in my hometown of Hyderabad . It was a peaceful town , and my father was a renowned chemist . One day , he was approached by members of the CIA , claiming that my father had made the discovery of the millennium in his small lab back at the university where he taught bio-chemistry . I never saw him again . I vowed to discover the whereabouts of my father and consequently joined the Indian Intelligence Bureau . __eou__ What does that have to do with those men shooting at us ? Most importantly , why did you lie to me ! __eou__ I ’ m sorry , I wasn ’ t supposed to meet you . I wasn ’ t supposed to fall in love with you , but you have to believe me when I tell you that what I feel for you is real . __eou__ I can ’ t believe this ! Why are all these things happening to me ! I can ’ t take it anymore ! Let me out of the car ! __eou__ Veronica , wait ! __eou__
Do you remember John from head office ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Have you heard what happened to him ? __eou__ No , what ? __eou__ He had his car stolen . Actually he was kidnapped while he was in the car . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , apparently , he was just getting into his car-he'd parked it in one of those underground multi-story things-he was just getting in and suddenly three guys with guns opened the back doors of the car and got in . __eou__ Crikey . Where did this happen ? __eou__ In Taichung , I think . __eou__ Oh , right , I hear they have a lot of this kind of problem down there . __eou__ Really ? Well , anyway , they pointed their guns at him and said , you know , keep calm and drive out . ... we don't want to hurt you ... we just want your car . __eou__ So what happened ? __eou__ Well , he drove out , and when he got to the booth to pay the attendant , he pretended to have an epileptic fit , you know , to scare the thieves away . The attendant was no help at all , even though the guys were holding guns in plain view , he did nothing . __eou__ That's terrible . __eou__ Yes , makes you think , doesn't it ? __eou__ So what happened next ? __eou__ Well , he kept on pretending to have a fit , so they freaked out and just ran away . __eou__ Well , he sure was lucky . __eou__ I'll say . __eou__
Lucy , what are your priorities when buying a car ? __eou__ I guess the first thing is the price , the second is the size , and of course the color will play a role too . But I have to be honest . It is our today ’ s responsibility to take care about our environment . Therefore , I will also pay attention to the fuel consumption of the car . You know , the rise in gasoline prices is huge . So I would rather to consider a smaller car with smaller engine . For which I can also save some tax . Last of the list , I also consider the safety . __eou__ What about the environmental factors ? __eou__ Well , I do prefer the lower emission cars as long as it doesn ’ t cost much . Some environmentally-friendly cars are really expensive . __eou__ Sure they are . Some hi-tech devices are built in to make sure they pollute less . Some of these green cars have not become standard . So the production costs are still high . But anyway , we should make efforts to start with . __eou__
Last night I looked for my Indian classmate Barbara . I found her sitting with her legs crossed and quietly practicing . __eou__ Needless to say , it must be Indian Yoga . __eou__ Mary , you say something about it . __eou__ Tracing back , Yoga has a very long history . It was originated before India had approved Yoga and these documents were arranged and written according to the contents passed by mouth to mouth . In other words , Yoga is passed down from ancient times , which cannot be recalled . __eou__
What kind of document is an invoice ? __eou__ It's a document from the seller to the buyer . It contains full particulars of the goods sold , such as quantity , quality , price , forwarding particulars , and terms of payment . __eou__ How many kinds of foreign invoices are there ? __eou__ Four . They are Loco invoice , FOB invoice , CIF invoice and Franco invoice . __eou__ What does the price in different kinds of invoices include ? __eou__ By Loco invoice , the price includes only the cost of goods at the warehouse of the seller . By FOB invoice , the price includes the cost before the cargo is delivered . By CIF invoice , the price includes all the expenses of cost freight and insurance . The price in Franco invoice includes all expenses to destination . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__
Every honored guests , welcome to Hang Thou . Now we are visiting Tiger-running Spring . __eou__ How can we relate tiger to this spot , Miss Zhang ? __eou__ Its name originates from a legend that two tigers run here and made a hole , and then a spring gushed out from it . __eou__ How ignorant I am ! __eou__ The Longing Tea and the Tiger-running Spring water are always considered as the “ Two Wonders in West Lake . ” __eou__ I know that tea . It smells fragrant . __eou__ That's right . All my guests , attention please . We will have half an hour to visit the spring and take photos . And next spot will be the Moon Reflected in Three Pools . __eou__ Janice , David , come here . We take some photos here . I can't imagine how beautiful it is ! __eou__
Wow ! It's hot today ! Do you want to get an ice cream cone ? __eou__ No Let's go to an ice cream parlor ! They have way more flavors to choose from there . I feel like having something special like Neapolitan ice cream . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ It's three different flavors mixed together . Chocolate , strawberry and something green with candied fruit . __eou__ Do they have ice cream bars . frozen yogurt or frozen chocolate mousse ? __eou__ Absolutely ! They also have real Italian Galatian and French sorbets . They do a great baked Alaska . __eou__ Maybe a vanilla ice cream milkshake would be good . What's your favorite flavor ? __eou__ Well ... l like the traditional flavors like rum raisin , butter pecan . maple walnut , strawberry , chocolate and vanilla . But now there are some new flavors from Asia like green tea and durian . __eou__ God ! Even talking about it makes me feel like l'm gaining weight ! __eou__ That's OK . We can go jogging , after we eat ! __eou__
more and more Chinese are marrying foreigners . __eou__ that's true . But I have a low opinion of those women who go out with foreigners . __eou__ oh , why ? __eou__ I think some Chinese wone marry foreigners for money while others just want to live abroad . There is no true love between them . __eou__ I wouldn't say that's totally true . I've met many happy intercultural couples . __eou__ well , then why aren't there many East-West couples where the man is a Chinese and the woman is a Westerner ? __eou__ I guess it's because the Chinese women are more attractive to Western men . __eou__ or because they are less attractive to to Chinese men . __eou__ what do you mean ? __eou__ you know , usually the woman is in her thirties and she is a left girl . __eou__ a left girl ? What's that ? __eou__ they're called that because they're left behind on the shelf . They're also known by their three H's---high diploma , high salary , and high degree . and they're also known as the three S's — single , __eou__ you have a point here , but I believe some mixed marriages are based on true love . __eou__ that ' for sure but very few . __eou__
What is your greatest strength ? __eou__ I think I am very good at planning . I manage my time well so that I can always get things done on time . __eou__ What is your weakness ? __eou__ I always give each job my best efforts , so when others are not pulling their weight , I am frustrated . __eou__ What is your greatest accomplishment ? __eou__ I got the Scientific Research Prize from the Gansu government for my achievements in the Northwest Regional Economy Development Research Project . __eou__ Can you work under pressure ? __eou__ Working under pressure is exciting and challenging . I don ’ t mind . In fact , I am very efficient when certain pressure is exerted on the work . __eou__ What are the problems you have encountered in your job and how do you solve them ? __eou__ There was a time when both the clerical assistant and the secretary resigned at the same time . I then had to handle their work temporarily . The workload was incredibly heavy . So I started to set priorities for the jobs and hired part-time staff to handle routine work . Finally , I managed to keep the operation smooth until we found someone to fill the vacancy . __eou__ How do you deal with those who you think are difficult to work with ? __eou__ I stick to my principles and keep to the rules . Sometimes , they just lack enthusiasm and I get them involved with something constructive . Some of them change their attitude later . __eou__
Have you had a chance to look over the contract ? __eou__ Yes . I've read it carefully . __eou__ And do you have any questions ? __eou__ No . But the contract stipulates that I will teach 22 hours a week.Will you have thatmany classes for me right away ? __eou__ No , probably not . For the first two weeks you may teach 10 or 15 hours . __eou__ But my salary will be 1100 dollars a month.Will you pay me that much for the first month ? Because , I mean , I won't be working so many hours . __eou__ I understand . That's why I didn't write the date on the contract.For the first two weeks , we will pay you according to the hours you teach.When you have 22 hours of classes , then the contract will take effect.Is that alright with you ? __eou__ Oh , so I don't sign the contract today . Is that right ? __eou__ I don't want you to misunderstand , Miss Briggs.We are very serious about hiring you . We want you to teach for us.We usually do contracts this way because it is more convenient . __eou__ I can accept that . __eou__ Good . And your benefits will begin immediately . __eou__ Even my health insurance ? __eou__ Yes . We will apply for your health insurance tomorrow.And your free membership in the club starts today if you like . __eou__ I have a few questions about the free membership . __eou__ What would you like to know ? __eou__ Is my membership the same as paying club members ? I mean , can I get discounts at club hotels ? __eou__ Absolutely . The only difference is in the restaurant and bar vouchers . __eou__ What are bar vouchers ? __eou__ Paying club members get around 300 dollars a year in restaurant vouchers.The vouchers can be used in the restaurant or the lounge.But we don't offer vouchers to employees . __eou__ But according to the contract , employees get a discount in the restaurant . __eou__ That's right . So in a way , it is cheaper for you than for the members.You get more benefits than they do . __eou__ So , for now , you want me to keep a copy of the contract.But we won't sign it yet . That right ? __eou__ Yes . I've prepared the contract just so that you understand everything.So that you understand the terms . __eou__ I understand.And according to the terms on the contract , I am happy to accept this job . I look forward to it . __eou__ I'm very pleased . We look forward to having you here , Miss Briggs . __eou__
What schools have you attended ? __eou__ I finished Young Primary School in 1998 , and entered Xi ’ an Middle School that same September . I graduated from there in July of 2004 , and that September I entered Wuhan University , where I'm studying now . __eou__ How do you think the education you have received will contribute to your work in this company ? __eou__ I think I have a good understanding of fundamentals in the areas your company deals with , and I can go on from here to build up the specific skills and knowledge I need to do my job well . __eou__ Your graduation thesis was on Medical Application of Laser , right ? What were your conclusions ? __eou__ Yes . I did some work on that , and I found out some really interesting things about the conductivity of liquid helium . I was sure I had a great discovery until my teacher told me the same discovery already made twenty years ago . I think the most important thing , I learnt though , was the importance of keeping good records . __eou__
So , got any more ideas for the website ? __eou__ Well , since we're collecting gifts instead of red envelopes , I made a " for guests only " gift chat room . __eou__ But we registered at Macy's . People can just buy gifts there . __eou__ The Taiwanese won't have time to buy gifts in America . The chat room is more convenient . __eou__ You're right . They can discuss what to get and avoid buying the same things . __eou__ Or discuss what gifts they could buy together . __eou__ Any other ideas ? __eou__ We can also put a guest book on the website for people to sign and write comments . __eou__ And we were going to make a collage for each of us using our baby pictures ... __eou__ Yeah , that will be the best part . Jack hasn't seen yours yet , right ? __eou__ No . He has no idea what a fat little pig I was ! __eou__

I'd be very willing to help you with that . __eou__ Thanks . I really appreciate it.In fact , I do need a letter of recommendation for this scholarship . __eou__ What kind of scholarship is it ? __eou__ It's an undergraduate scholarship offered by the American Minority Students Scholarship Association . I'm eligible for it because I'm Asian American . __eou__ Fine . I know about that scholarship.You have to be a student in your junior year , and you have to have a grade point average of 3.7 or higher . __eou__ I'm a junior now , and my GPA is 3.92 . __eou__ Excellent . So you'll have a good chance of getting it . __eou__ Well , I hope so . The competition is probably pretty heavy.And they want a writing sample too . __eou__ Do you have an essay you want to send them ? __eou__ No , they want a special essay . I must write an essay on a particular question they pose . __eou__ What is the question ? __eou__ They give applicants a topic.The topic is , The Place of Ethnic Minorities in a Democratic Society.My essay must be three pages typed and double-spaced . __eou__ That's a pretty short essay . __eou__ Yes , but I need to write it by next week . __eou__ Good luck . I'm sure you will do a good job . __eou__ I came here today to talk to you because ... Well , I need to ask two favors . __eou__ Sure . What are they ? __eou__ First , I need a letter of recommendation . __eou__ I'd be happy to write one for you . __eou__ And second ... Well , I'm not sure if it's normal . __eou__ What is it ? Do you want me to read your essay ? __eou__ Yes , if you could . I mean , if you could read it to make sure there are no mistakes.Or maybe you'd have some suggestions . __eou__ Of course I could read it . That's no problem .

I'm very grateful . __eou__ Don't mention it . I'm always willing to help good students . __eou__
Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I need to apply for a parking permit . __eou__ Are you a professor ? __eou__ What ? Are you kidding ? I'm only 22 years old ! __eou__ Yes , I am kidding.But don't you know only professors and students with disabilitiescan apply for parking permits ? __eou__ Yes , I know . I have a disability.My hip was broken last year . And I can't walk well . __eou__ Oh , I'm sorry . I didn't know . __eou__ It's alright . You didn't see me walk to the desk . __eou__ Here is the application form . I also need to see your student ID and your permission letter from the university . __eou__ My permission letter ? __eou__ Yes , the letter that certifies you have a disability.And it must certify your disability entitles you to a parking place . __eou__ I was told I should have the letter sent directly to your office . __eou__ Yes .

Where are you going to play this weekend ? __eou__ I have not given it much thought . Do you have any good suggestions ? __eou__ I want to spend two days in the mountains with friends . The city is too noisy . Do you know Tangle Temple ? __eou__ I have been there . It is in the middle of the mountains . It is not noisy there and you have to be a vegetarian . __eou__ Do you want to climb the mountain with us ? __eou__ Does it have enough lodging ? __eou__ No problem . The temple is quite large . __eou__ There are many ancient pine trees there . It is especially quiet at night . It is wonderful to listen to the monks chanting while listening to the soothing sound of the winds in the pine trees . __eou__ I'm getting a little excited now . What clothes should I wear ? __eou__ Take some thick clothes with you . It is rather cold there at night . If you wear the T-shirt you're wearing now , you will become a ' popsicle ' . __eou__ Anything else I should bring ? __eou__ If you like taking pictures , you may bring a camera with you . __eou__ Needless to say . __eou__
Catherine , have you ever seen the movie Fast Food Nation ? __eou__ Yes , I remember it was inspired by a New York Times best-seller of the same name . __eou__ It's very thought-provoking , isn't it ? __eou__ Exactly . It reveals the dark side of the all-American meal . __eou__ So what do you think of the American fast food culture ? __eou__ I think America really deserves the name of " fast food nation - as people can find McDonald ' s , KFC and Pizza Hut almost all over the States . __eou__ And everyone knows that Americans ' favorite food is the hamburger , isn't it ? __eou__ Sure . You see , Tom , fast food is a lifestyle that craves convenience . People just don't care whether it is healthy or not . __eou__ But I think some healthy menu options are also served at fast food restaurants .. __eou__ What are they ? __eou__ Such as fat-free milk , whole-wheat rolls and fish sandwich . __eou__ They're much better __eou__ But I'm not sure if they're well-rcceived . __eou__ That's the point . People usually don't have much time to think about it when they have a on-the-go meal . __eou__ Well , Americans may need to find a way to make the most of their fast foods . __eou__ I suppose so . __eou__
May , could you bring this note to Professor Li for me today ? __eou__ Sure , no problem . Asking for leave again ? You have been absent from class five times this semester . __eou__ I know . But attending Miss Li's class is just waste of time . No more than one third of her students will go to her class . __eou__ I agree that Miss Li doesn't teach so well . Most students either sleep or do other things in her class . __eou__ Yeah , my boyfriend plays the video game every time in class with me . Or I chat with my friends through text messages . __eou__ Fortunately her class is just an elective course , not as important as compulsory courses . __eou__ Right , so we must spare some time to attend selective courses . __eou__ But isn't it too impolite to be absent ? __eou__ What can I do ? I have things to do in Students ' Government . __eou__ Oh , I thought you just gave an excuse on this note . __eou__ Sometimes I will try various excuses . But this is my last time asking for leave . Or I will have a bad record . __eou__ Yeah , besides , your credit will be deducted . That is kind of serious . __eou__ I have been absented from many classes this semester just because of my work in the Students ' Government . __eou__ You can't write with one hand and draw with the other . __eou__ I am thinking about quitting my job in the student government . But before that , I must do my job . Bye . Don't forget about that note . __eou__ You can count on me . __eou__
Bruno's . __eou__ Hi , I'm calling from Nika Corporation . We would like to hold a business lunch at the restaurant . __eou__ Oh , certainly . I'm Linda , the Manager . I can help you with that . How many will there be in your party ? __eou__ There will be about 18 people . __eou__ Okay . For a party that size , we have a separate banquet room in the back . __eou__ Is there an extra charge to reserve the room ? __eou__ No , as long as you can guarantee at least 15 guests , there is no extra charge . __eou__ That's great . I'd like to go ahead and reserve the room , then , for Friday , December 2 , at around noon . This is a retirement party and we'd like to bring a cake for the guest of honor and some bottles of champagne . Will that be acceptable ? __eou__ The cake is no problem at all , but we do charge a corkage fee of $ 15 a bottle for any alcohol not purchased from the restaurant . __eou__ Oh , that's fine . __eou__ Great . I have the banquet room reserved for a lunch on for Nika Corporation on the 2nd of December . May I have your name and contact information ? __eou__ Sure . I'm J McQuillin and my number is 323-555-6840 , extension 42 . __eou__ Thanks , Mr . McQuillin . I'll give you a call a week in advance to confirm the arrangements . __eou__ Sounds good . Thanks for your help . __eou__ Thank you for choosing Bruno's . We look forward to seeing you on the 2nd . __eou__
Good morning . I ’ d like to ask some questions about your insurance policies . __eou__ Of course . Please sit down . How can I help you ? __eou__ I bought a house recently and would like to insure it and its content . __eou__ I see . Here ’ s a pamphlet about our home insurance policy . We ’ Ve named our policy ” umbrella ” . May I ask how much you paid for your home and where you live ? These are the two main thing that decide how much your premiums are . __eou__ I understand . I live in the Oakfield area and paid $ 100,000 for my home . __eou__ Let me just check that on my computer . Oakfield is a low risk area , so your premiums will probably be around $ 100 a month . The other thing to take into account is deductibles . __eou__ In this pamphlet it says that the minimum amount for deductibles is $ 2000 . what does that mean exactly ? __eou__ It means That the first $ 2000 of any claim you make must be paid by you . The insurance policy covers any amount above that , up to the agreed limit . __eou__ Oh , I see . That ’ s fine . What is the advantage of having higher deductibles ? __eou__ If you have higher deductibles , your premium are lower , because you will pay more of the claim and we will pay less . __eou__ It seems that I should do some calculations before deciding . I presume that the insurance period can be for as long as we agree . __eou__ We initially sign one-year policies with our policyholders . These are renewable after the first year . __eou__ If I have a claim , how long does it take to make a settlement ? I ’ Ve heard that with some insurance companies , it can take months . __eou__ That is of great concern to out clients . We aim to satisfy all claims within a month , but we can ’ t guarantee that __eou__
It's time to leave the office for the night . Firstly I log off my computer , then I set the electronic security system . __eou__ That's pretty advanced . __eou__ Now I'll quickly send a short message to my wife and take the elevator down to the basement . __eou__ Is that where you park ? __eou__ Yes , the car park is under constant video surveillance , so my car is quite safe . Please get in . __eou__ Thank you . Where is your key ? __eou__ There's no need , I have keyless entry , and the steering wheel recognizes my finger prints before starting the car . Now , we can look at the navigation system to find the best route home . __eou__ That's amazing , it even shows all the roads that are congested at the moment . __eou__ Using GPS I can rely on this to direct me home . Now I just need to find my E-Card to automatically open the gate and we can drive out . __eou__ Pretty soon cars will be driving themselves . __eou__ Maybe , but in the meantime why not help me find the remote control for my garage door ? __eou__ Here it is , and here we are . __eou__ When I turn off my home alarm , the house will automatically tum on the lights and set the climate to a comfortable level . __eou__ I have to get home , but I don't need all of this fancy technology , I think I'll just walk . __eou__
These things are always oooo boring . Heard any gossip ? Anybody making the big bucks ? __eou__ Rich struck it rich in advertising . And he and Cath got married and just had a child . __eou__ That's no news . Those two were high school sweethearts anyway . __eou__ Teresa Jones got a boob job . __eou__ Uh , I can see that . And Erica Falls has lost a lot of weight . __eou__ I've got something . You saw Taylor Smith ? Looks terrible , doesn't he ? I heard he ... __eou__
I think the government needs a radical plan to improve things . The government just talks , but in the long run , nothing is done to improve the economy . __eou__ That's right . They always talk about a need for new , progressive tactics , but they haven't done anything to stimulate new jobs . __eou__ Well , income taxes were decreased last year in hope to give the economy a boost , but I think it's backfired . The immediate effect of the tax reduction was to cause inflation to rise . __eou__ The worst part is that the inflation hurts the poor more than the rich . It also leads to more unemployment in the long run . I don't know what a good solution would be to make the economy more vibrant again ... __eou__ I have a good solution ... We need some new blood ! We should get rid of this president and boat in some new leaders ! __eou__
What do you reading , Linda ? __eou__ I'm reading a novel , The mill on the floss , written by the famous novelist gorge alias . __eou__ What's it about ? __eou__ It's meanly about relationship between a brother and a sister , who live in the mill on the river floss . It describe there are childhood and disputes cause them to separate , the book ends with them ha __eou__ Is it difficult to understand ? __eou__ Not really , i would consider it easy . __eou__ Besides novels , any other types literary works that you indulgence . __eou__ I really like short stories . __eou__ Have you read anything else besides literature ? __eou__ Certainly I have . I like to read books on vary subjects , and i can read everything I can get my hands on in my spare time . I don't want to idle away and waste my time . __eou__ I agree . People who don't read are no better often people who can't read . I also agree that books are like food for the mind . __eou__
Did you hear about car accident on Spring Road yesterday ? __eou__ Yes , I did . I heard that they took both drivers to hospital . One needed surgery . __eou__ Yes . I heard he had a few broken bones too , but that the doctors have set the fractures without any problems . __eou__ The second driver was luckier . He had a concussion and needed some stitches for his head wound . __eou__ Yes . He was released from hospital yesterday evening . The other man could be there for weeks . __eou__ I understand that he ’ s connected to a heart monitor and breathing apparatus . His condition can ’ t be very good . __eou__ The hospital announced this morning that his condition is poor but stable . What does that mean ? __eou__ It means he ’ s really badly injured , but he will almost certainly survive . __eou__ His family will be pleased to hear that . They must have been so worried . __eou__
You know we went great lengths to promote the sales of your products . Through our continuous effort , consumers tend to accept your product . So , there will be a potential market for your product in this area , and would you let us act as your agent ? __eou__ We appreciate your efforts in promoting the sale of our clothes in the market of this city . But according to our record , your annual turnover is not too big , so I think it is premature for us to discuss the question of agency . __eou__ If that's the case , we can talk about it first . What's your concept of a big amount ? __eou__ I mean to double the amount for your sales this year at least . __eou__ I'm afraid that's too much for us . __eou__ We know you have done a good job in building up these exports for us . However , our company has the regulation for the agency . __eou__ All right , we accept the challenge . What about the commission ? You know , we usually get a 20 % commission of the amount on every deal . __eou__ I am sorry to say that it's a little higher . Our agents in other areas usually get a 3 % to 6 % commission . __eou__ You may have known that we have competitors from South Korea and other countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to have the market investigation and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in newspaper and TV programs . A 20 % commission will not leave us much . __eou__ Our price is worked out according to the costing . A 20 % commission means an increase in our price . So , I'm afraid we have to decline your proposal of acting as our sole agent . __eou__ Oh , that's pitiful . __eou__
I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks . __eou__ Yes , Mr . Bergeron . You mentioned that in your letter . To tell you the truth , your proposal surprised us . __eou__ Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market . __eou__ Do you sell direct to shops ? __eou__ Yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen . __eou__ Do you keep a stock of these things ? __eou__ In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents . Generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . We are paid for our service , of course . __eou__ That is , your commission . __eou__ Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal . __eou__ Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission . __eou__ The European market is not familiar with your products . You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs . A 10 % commission will not leave us much . __eou__ According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ? __eou__ We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with . __eou__ We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . But our suggestion to you , Mr . Bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ... __eou__ Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ? __eou__ Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10 % commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect . __eou__ Oh , that's just too bad . I intended to make great efforts in selling your products . __eou__ Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details . __eou__ Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ? __eou__ Oh , yes . We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction . __eou__ All right , but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair . And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency . __eou__ Very good . We will discuss the matter again at the next Fair . __eou__
Did you hear the news ? Two of our major suppliers , Murphy Music and U-Tunes are merging ! If they are conglomerated into one company into one company , it would have some serious affects on our market strategy . __eou__ Are you sure ? Who told you that ? I highly doubt that they would take the step to merge into one company ... They're supposed to be bitter enemies , the strictest of competitors.It must be a rumor.It can't be true . __eou__ I read it myself on the financial page.They ' re really going to join together . U-Tunes was bought out by Murphy's , they will take over the company as of next month . __eou__ The competition must have been too stiff for U-Tunes.Otherwise why would they allow themselves to be taken over by their sworn enemy ? __eou__ I guess they must have figured it would be easier to merge than to keep up the cutthroat competition.If you can't beat'em , join'em . __eou__
do you remember where you were for the terrorist attacks on 9-11 ? __eou__ yes , I was in my apartment in Beijing . Where were you ? __eou__ I was at home with my parents in New York City . __eou__ really ? Did you see the hijacked planes crash into and destroy the twin towers ? __eou__ I didn't see the crash itself , but I did see the smoke and everything afterwards from my parents ' apartment building . __eou__ that must have been horrible . Did you go out at all that day to see what was going on ? __eou__ no , we decided to stay in our apartment . With all the buses out of service and the underground trains at a halt , many people had no choice but to walk home . It was utter chaos . __eou__ did you know anyone who worked in the World Trade Center ? __eou__ yes , my uncle's firm had an office in one of the towers . __eou__ did he survive ? __eou__ unfortunately , he wasn't able to evacuate in time . He ended up dying in the tower . __eou__ I'm sorry . That must have really been a nightmarish day for you and your family . __eou__ it was . The hijackers didn't have any respect for human life not even their own . __eou__ terrorist acts are deliberate and deadly and can affect every walk of life . __eou__
Hello , Mr . Brown . How are you today ? __eou__ I ’ m very well , thank you . __eou__ that ’ s good to hear . Shall we get started ? I see from your application form that you ’ Ve worked as a maintenance man for over 7 years . __eou__ yes , that ’ s true . __eou__ what kind of work did you do ? __eou__ I fixed many kinds of machine tools such as milling machines , grinders , welders , etc . I also repaired other things such as vacuums , toilets , locks , etc . I also did some electrical work . I took some courses about electrical systems . __eou__ That ’ s good . What kind of electrical work did you do ? __eou__ I took care of commercial and residential coolers and heaters . I fixed many kinds of power failure problems . Some co-workers and I even rewired part of a building . __eou__ well , your work experience sounds good for the job we have open . Now tell me about the best job you ’ Ve ever had , please . __eou__ the best job ? What do you mean ? __eou__ like the job you feel the most proud of . __eou__ I think my favorite job so far was when I worked for Linaria . It was hard work but the people on my job crew were great to work with . We really worked as a team . I enjoy working with those people . __eou__ Tell me something about a time when you did something well , something you feel proud of . __eou__ I fixed a big problem with a machine and saved a lot of money for the factory . I got bonus for it . __eou__ that ’ s great . No wonder you feel proud of that . Now let me ask you another question . __eou__ Go ahead , please . __eou__ in all the jobs you ’ Ve had , what was it you disliked the most ? __eou__ wow , this question is hard to answer . I don ’ t think I ’ Ve ever had a job that I really disliked . But I dislike work that is monotonous , always the same from day to day . I like to move around and do different things . __eou__ all right . Do you have any questions ? __eou__ no . I can ’ t think of any right now . __eou__ you ’ ll hear from us by the end of this week . __eou__ thank you very much . I ’ m looking forward to hearing from you about this job . __eou__
Which of the steps are you focusing on in brandgrowth Awareness , understanding , acceptance , or loyalty ? __eou__ We're working on different steps in different areas.For example , our Colbert line is thriving in American markets , we've already reached the loyalty stage.In Asia , however , it's a different story.Most people haven't even heard of Colbert , so we're working on awareness through a lot of product launches and related activities . __eou__ What are you doing to increase understanding in the European sector ? __eou__ Understanding comes from product differentiation.We get that through product demonstration , literature , expert testimonials , and the like . __eou__
Okay , here are the graphs and figures for this month's sales . Let's review them all together . __eou__ This first one , I have a question ... This graph is marking the sales performance for our line of hair products , right ? Can this line be right ? It looks like our sales plummeted . I can't believe we did that poorly ... If I remember correctly , sales went down slightly , but not as dramatically as the graph shows . __eou__ I think you are looking at the wrong line . The rapid drop in sales wasn't our hair products . You are correct , the hair product sales decreased slightly , but not dramatically . The one that didn't do so hot this month was the cleaning products . I think there was a problem in the marketing plan . Some people were offended by our advertisements for the cleaning products , but it was already too late to mitigate the damage , so our mistake shows up in the sales . __eou__ Well , the good news is the new industrial cleaning products really took off . Look how the sales have shot up over the last two weeks . __eou__ That is our one major success . If you look at the other graphs , you can see that most of the other product lines remained steady with little increase . __eou__ At lease they stayed the same . That's better than dropping . __eou__
Hey , John ! I haven ’ t seen you in ages ! What ’ s new ? What have you been up to ? __eou__ Pete ! Nice to see you Well , on top the norm , you know , wife and kids and work , I ’ Ve actually gotten into doing some trading . __eou__ Trading ? You , big guy ? What are you trading ? __eou__ Currencies . __eou__ Currencies ? As in Euros , Dollars , Pounds and Rupees ? __eou__ It ’ s called Forex . Foreign Exchange . The great thing about it is that I don ’ t have to invest a huge amount . I put in a margin deposit and then I can buy and sell up to 100 times that much ! __eou__ I don ’ t understand . You ’ re buying and selling money ? __eou__ You got it ! Just last night I made USD 150 ! __eou__ Last night ? __eou__ Yeah ! It ’ s a 24 hour market ! I had bought some RIB earlier at a low asking price but last night it appreciated drastically so I made a split second decision and sold all my RIB at an amazing bid ! I ’ __eou__ You ’ re kidding ! I ’ m on ! Where do I sign up ? __eou__
Do you know how happy I am ? The Ant Kingdom is a perfect world with colorful fairy tales . It seems like the air is fresh here . __eou__ Just kids like that . __eou__ Come on baby , stop trying to pretend like a man . If you go there , you are sure to like them . __eou__ Hurry up ! Hurry up ! What lovely caterpillars are over there ! __eou__ I said you are sure to like them . There is the Grand Parade Of Ants Carnival in a few minutes in the square . You will experience a dream of fantasy . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ All kinds of insects dress themselves up . They drive straight their own Flower Cars along the Parade Avenue of Ants Kingdom . __eou__ That's splendid . Can you take three pictures of me with them ? __eou__ I thought you had grown out of such child practices . __eou__ Cut it out . Look at my smile , and it seems like the flowers in the spring . Right ? __eou__ Gross ! __eou__ Hurry up ! The smile is frozen on my face . __eou__
Look at this headline - Elvis Baby Born on Spacecraft . Where do these tabloids get such crazy stories ? __eou__ I ’ Ve often wondered the same thing . I also wonder who reads them . Then I realize that I ’ m standing here reading them myself . __eou__ It looks as though everyone in line reads them , or at least looks at the headlines . __eou__ I think we picked the right line . This one seems to be moving more quickly than the others . __eou__ Maybe our checker is faster at scanning the food . __eou__ I ’ m glad . We have only about twenty things here , and I ’ m in a hurry to get home . __eou__
I ’ m so frustrated ! __eou__ what ’ s wrong , Jim ? __eou__ I called the electronics shop to find out what time they close , and it took me twenty minutes to get what I wanted ! __eou__ Twenty minutes just to find out what their business hours are ? __eou__ yes.They have some sort of digital receptionist.So when I called in , a machine told me to push a button for the department I wanted to be transferred to . __eou__ Oh , I hate getting voicemail instead of a person.What did you do ? __eou__ I just kept pushing buttons . I was transferred to customer service , but there a machine told me to choose between technical help , warranty information , or price information . __eou__ Couldn ’ d you choose to be transferred to a real person ? __eou__ Eventually I did get to a real person . I found out the closing time , but by then the store had already closed ! __eou__
Have you heard anything about Markweed Inc . ? They have called me back for interview , and I'm considering taking a job with them . __eou__ Well , to start with , Markweed Inc . has a reputation for being one of the best employers in the field . __eou__ The best ... huh ? With so many companies out there , how did they establish themselves in such a solid position on top ? __eou__ First of all , they have an excellent benefits package for all employees , even the maintenance staff have health and dental coverage . __eou__ Really ? What about the pay rate ? Are the wages pretty high ? __eou__ From what I hear , they are very reasonable . A lot of the prestige the company has built is because they have attacked some high profile employees with their incentives . __eou__ Well , what about the work environment ? Not every one is motivated solely by money . __eou__ It's a great place to work . They give you fair pay and benefits , and a lot of room to grow . I think if they off you a job , you should definitely take it . __eou__
Excuse me.May I see the manager of your store ? __eou__ I am the manager.Can I help you ? __eou__ Oh , great , I saw a job ad outside your store . I am interested in the job advertised . I am coming to see if there is any opportunity available for me . __eou__ All right.Take a seat , please.Would you like to be a shop assistant or a cashier ? __eou__ I can do the work of shop assistant and I worked part time in a small department store during my summer vocation last year . __eou__ So now do you want a full-time job or part-time job ? __eou__ At present , both are OK for me.What do you need most , then ? __eou__ Now we really need some part-time workers.You see , our full-time staff knocks off at five pm , but now we hope to extend the hours to eight pm.We need some part-time shop assistants to work 3 hours a day from five pm to eight pm.But I am not sure if you are qualified for the job.Since most of our customers are foreign , competence of good communication in English is necessary here . __eou__ I think I can . I have been learning English for almost 5 years and especially I am fluent at speaking English.Also , I have made some foreigners friends during the experience of learning English . __eou__ That is fine . I think you have the qualifications needed for the job , so I will let you have the job.Does the work schedule suit you ? __eou__ It quite suits me . I am free in the evening these days , I will have no difficulty starting at five pm . __eou__ Good.There is only thing to be settled.Ten RIB an hour is the maximum we can pay you.Is the rate of pay acceptable to you ? __eou__ It seems reasonable.By the way , I can get my earning raised with a excellent performance , can't I ? __eou__ Sure.You will get more if you can invite more customers with your good service . __eou__ I see . I will try my best to do the job well . __eou__ That is good of you to say so.When can you start working ? __eou__ How about next monday ? __eou__ Ok.Let ' s make is next Monday . I n the end , you need to fill out the application form . __eou__ Thank you for your kindness , ma'am . See you next Monday . __eou__
I think I should join a fitness centre . I am getting a little fat and I'm totally out of shape . Even a quick walk of a few hundred metres leaves me out of breath . __eou__ I'm afraid you are beginning to look a little overweight . You really need to stop smoking . That's the main reason you're unhealthy . __eou__ I guess you're right . I've tried stopping , but I just can't seem to quit . __eou__ Why don't you try smoking one cigarette less each day ? How many do you smoke each day now ? __eou__ I smoke around 30 each day . __eou__ Ok . So for one month , reduce the number you smoke by one a day . At the end of the month , you'll have quit . You should also buy a tracksuit and go jogging every morning . You don't need to jog far . __eou__ If I do a few exercises at home , like crunches , I'll soon deal with this waistline . __eou__ Be careful when you go jogging . Don't put yourself under too much stress . You're still a smoker shouldn't do too much exercises in your condition . __eou__ I'll join a fitness centre . I'm sure they'll be able to give me more advice . There's one near my office , so I can go before and after work . I don't want to go jogging in the street , so I'll use a treadmill . __eou__ Good idea . Remember to eat healthily too . The trainers at the fitness centre will be able to advise you on your diet . __eou__
Guess what came in the mail today ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ My acceptance letter to Yale ! __eou__ Wow ! Congratulation ! When do classes start ? __eou__ Freshman orientation is the last week of august , but I want to go two weeks before that to get settled in . __eou__ You ’ re so lucky ! Do you have to do many things before you leave ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ ll be very busy ! I have to get a visa , buy a plane ticket , and pack my things . But first , I want to register for classes . __eou__ When can you do that ? __eou__ Well , they sent me their prospectus , so I can start looking now . do you want to help me decide which classed to take ? __eou__ Sure . What can you choose from ? __eou__ Well , I have to take all the fundamental course , plus a few from my major . __eou__ What is your major ? __eou__ I hope to major in English literature , but the admissions counselor told me that many people change their major many times in their first year , so we ’ ll see . __eou__ What are the fundamental course ? __eou__ In order to graduate , every student must take a certain amount of classes in history , math , English , philosophy , science and art . __eou__ Interesting . That ’ s very different from the Chinese education system . __eou__ Yes , it is . It ’ s also very different from the British education system . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ oh , sure . In British , students don ’ t have to take the foundation course . __eou__ why not ? __eou__ maybe because they think they know everything already ! ha ha . __eou__
Have you declared your income and are you prepared to pay tax ? __eou__ Not yet . I don't know how to fill out the form . What is the tax-free allowance for supporting a dependent ? __eou__ I don't really know . Why not ask the accountant or the lawyer of the law firm ? They will tell you which is subject or not subject to taxation . He can even help you avoid paying tax legally . __eou__ If I don't pay my taxes , would the tax officials discover it ? __eou__ Certainly . No one who evades tax can escape from their detection.They ' ll check your income through computers . You'd better make a declaration to the tax authorities as soon as possible . If you fail to meet the deadline , you will be fined . __eou__
A funny thing happened to me the other day . __eou__ Oh , yes ? __eou__ I was just thinking about someone I went to school with , this boy I was quite friendly with in third grade . We used to hang out together - he lived next door - but then my parents moved and I changed schools and never saw him again . __eou__ Mmm . __eou__ Well , I was walking down Nan Jing Dong Lu ( Nan-Jing E . Rd . ) during my lunch break thinking about this boy-I have no idea why I was thinking about him . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes . And suddenly I heard someone call my name . I turned around and there was this man looking at me . I didn't recognize him at all , but he obviously knew who I was . __eou__ Oh , yeah , that's embarrassing when that happens . __eou__ You got it . Well , he walked up to me and said my name again and then I realized it was the boy I had been thinking about , the one from third grade ! __eou__
What was the party like last night , Jean ? __eou__ Not bad at all , thanks . There were one or two interesting people there.Why couldn't you come ? __eou__ Well , I couldn't get away from work early . And when . I got home I had a headache , so I had to go straight to bed . But I was over-tired , because I wasn't able to get to sleep for hours . __eou__ What a shame . Why didn't you take a sleeping pill ? __eou__ I don't like them . I used to take them when I had to work overtime , you know . __eou__ How many did you use to take ? __eou__ Three every night . __eou__ Good heavens . Why did you take so many ? __eou__ Because I was under a terrible strain . The doctor saidthey weren't very strong . Anyway , I used to feel awful the next morning . __eou__ I'm sure you did . __eou__ The doctor said I had to be careful . __eou__ He was quite right . __eou__ So I stopped drinking coffee late at night instead . __eou__
You've got a beautiful singing voice ! __eou__ It's this high-tech equipment that doctors my voice a little . Actually , i am tone-deaf . __eou__ Come on , You hit the high notes perfectly ! __eou__ Well , the echo and the stereo system helped a lot . And i know that song very well , so , i didn't need to pay attention to the subtitles which helped as well . __eou__ You're too modest . Pass me the catalogue ! I'd like to see which song to choose.Wow , this place has a large selection of songs . I dont know which to choose ! __eou__ Pick the one that you always sing in the shower . __eou__ Funny.Oh , i like this song . It's by one of my favorite singers . __eou__ Read me the index number ! __eou__ 1021.It ' s a duet ! Come on , Pick the mic and sing along ! __eou__ No . I need a rest ! __eou__
I think we have everything in the contract . Shall we sign it ? __eou__ Wait a minute . I think we have missed an important point . We should include an arbitration clause in the contract . __eou__ I believe we can solve disputes through an amicable negotiation . __eou__ I hope so . too . But I still think the provision of arbitration is of great importance to both of us . __eou__ All right . I agree with you . But where do we hold arbitration ? __eou__ I suggest the arbitration be held in a third country . __eou__ It sounds reasonable . The clause should be like this - any disputes arising from the execution of this contract shall be settled in a friendly way . If no settlement can be reached through consul - nation and conciliation , the disputes shall be submitted for arbitration by a mutually nominated arbitrator . The arbitrator's decision on the dispute is final and binding on the both parties . __eou__ Ok . __eou__
Peter , I hope you will accept my quotation for the air freshener . __eou__ I wish I could place a monthly order for a minimum of 50 cases , introducing your goods to my customers , but your price , $ 100 for a case , is too high in this highly competitive market . __eou__ I have cut the price the minimum . You know our freshener is a patent product , different from other kinds of fresheners . We could not have quitted it at such a low price if it were not for your past large orders . This price , actually , leaves us with a very small profit . __eou__ People here desire medium-priced air freshener only . Please carefully consider my proposal , which will lead to a larger business between us . __eou__ The low price I'm offering you is as low as I can go . __eou__ Then , I am sorry to say I must regretfully decline your offer and seek quotations for the other suppliers . __eou__ I'm sorry , Peter . I hope you'll continue to approach us on other occasions if you cannot accept our offer now . __eou__ Yes . I'll welcome other opportunities to do business with you . __eou__
What are you reading about in that science magazine ? __eou__ There are several interesting articles on recent scientific breakthroughs . I just finished reading one about cloning . __eou__ I ’ m not sure I like the idea of that . I don ’ t want people copying me or other people . It could be very confusing . __eou__ According to the article , you have no real need to worry . Research nowadays is focussing on cloning parts of a human body to replace damaged or lost parts , not on recreating a whole human . __eou__ In the future , that could be possible . __eou__ In this article , scientists say that if you took the genes from someone and tried to create a copy of a person , there ’ s no guarantee that the copy would look or act like the original ! __eou__ Really ? What else have you discovered ? __eou__ I read about how scientists are using material from plants and animals to create new medicines . For example , an animal be immune to disease that affects human . So , scientists find out why it ’ s immune __eou__ That ’ s great , because it uses natural materials rather than ones that scientists make themselves . I prefer natural remedies to man-made ones . __eou__
The performance is amazing . I'm curious about how they did it . I mean the way they sing . __eou__ They must have practiced a lot . The perseverance has made them they are today . __eou__ So cool . Someone gave me this flier at the exit . What's it about ? __eou__ Let me have a look . Well , it lists some shows that will be on next week . __eou__ Oh , tell me about it . Anything interesting ? __eou__ Hmm ... Oh , this one , ' The Drunken Beauty ' . This is a real classic . __eou__ ' The Drunken Beauty ' ? It's funny that we have ' Sleeping Beauty ' in my country . Anyway , what's it about ? Is the beauty a drunkard ? __eou__ Of course not . She was said to be the most beautiful woman in her time and that made her become the queen . They play was famous for its singing and dancing . __eou__ Sure , people do that when they are drunk . What about the actress ? __eou__ She is an opera star in China . Her teacher's teacher is Mei Landfang . __eou__ Oh , I've heard about him before . He even created a special dance of sleeve shaking . __eou__ You are such an expert on it . I don't know that . __eou__ You know , interest is the best teacher . __eou__ So , want me to book the tickets again ? __eou__ Please do that . I can't wait to come back again . The performance must be really amazing . __eou__ We can do that if you like . Maybe next weekend . __eou__ That will be great . __eou__
Diana , in your opinion , which is more important , IQ or EQ ? __eou__ Why are you asking me the strange question , Jerry ? __eou__ I watched the movie Forrest Gump last night . And the question just lined in my mind . __eou__ Well . I think IQ matters more . But it won't work without EQ . __eou__ Why ? You seem pretty sure about it . __eou__ Because an intellectual mind can only be a beneficial thing in life . __eou__ But IQ is decided at birth.One can't expect to make a lot of improvement in it . __eou__ That's why people's achievement varies greatly . __eou__ That ' s true , but what if one comes across some difficulties . He must rely on his EQ to deal with them . __eou__ Yes , Jerry , can you share your understanding of EQ ? __eou__ I think it is independent of IQ and plays a prominent role in deciding the way we live our lives . __eou__ Quite right . Have you noticed that a high IQ is not a must for one's success ? __eou__ Just as Forrest ? __eou__ Yes , his IQ is high enough for him to embrace the success as long as he can manage his EQ . __eou__ I got it . __eou__
Hey , what sort of drinks do you want ? Gatorade or water ? __eou__ Gatorade . It ’ s rich in Vitamin and it gives us energy and vitality . __eou__ Yes , that ’ s the exact thing we need . One for each . __eou__ What should we do , now with Jack out of the game ? __eou__ We should choose from the backups . __eou__ That ’ s right . Spraining the ankle and breaking the leg are the common things during the match . __eou__ That ’ s why we should learn to protect ourselves . Otherwise , the game is not worth the candle . __eou__ That ’ s for sure . During the back court , we should change the position we played . __eou__ Yes , I played shooting guard , I like shooting and you ’ ll play inside , OK ? __eou__ I agree with you . I think we ’ ll play much better than before . __eou__ Wow , the cheer-section is coming . The music is so fantastic . __eou__ Yeah , look how passionate they are ! Are they professional ? __eou__ Well , you should ask your friend . You know I ’ m not the boss . Just kidding . __eou__ Oops ! I almost forget about it . Do you see the girl in the middle of the first line ? __eou__ Yeah , what ’ s up ? __eou__ Don ’ t you think she looks like your daughter ? __eou__ I also have a doubt . Oh , kill me softly , she is May . __eou__
Excuse me , have you got any laundry ? The laundryman is here to collect it . __eou__ Yes , I have . Here are my blouse , coats and stockings . __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ Oh , yes . My husband also has some laundry . This is his suit and here is his pajamas . __eou__ Are they to be dry-cleaned ? __eou__ Oh , no . Only the suit and coat are to be dry-cleaned . I want to have my blouse tomorrow evening . And I'd like the collar and cuffs starched . __eou__ Yes , but not too stiff , right ? __eou__ Exactly . Is it possible to have my overcoat dry-cleaned , too ? __eou__ There are a few spots on it . I am afraid you will not have it tomorrow . Dry-cleaning usually takes three days . __eou__ Oh , no . I also need this tomorrow evening . __eou__ In that case , I suppose I could ask the dry-cleaner to clean up the spots for the moment , and have it well pressed . You might get it back on time then . __eou__ That's a good idea . __eou__ By the way , a cotton came off your shirt you gave me the day before yesterday . __eou__ Yes , I noticed it yet . __eou__ The laundry has sewed on a new button for you . __eou__ Oh , thanks a lot . __eou__ I am afraid the new one is not exactly the same as the others . __eou__ Never mind , it doesn't matter . __eou__ If you have any more laundry , please just leave it in the laundry bag behind the bathroom door . The laundryman comes to collect it every morning . __eou__
You say your products are aimed at the green consumer . In what ways are they environmentally-friendly ? __eou__ We produce household cleaning products - detergents and so on . They are all phosphate-free , which minimises damage to the environment . __eou__ What about the packaging ? __eou__ We try to use as little packaging as possible . Also , all our bottles are made of recyclable plastic and we use recycled fibre in our boxes . That's what our customers want . __eou__
Who was the best teacher that you ever had ? __eou__ That would have to be Miss Baymler , my fourth grade teacher . __eou__ What was she like ? __eou__ She was patient , kind , fun , smart , caring , and yet strict , too . I really learned a lot from her . __eou__ What kind of things did you learn ? __eou__ She taught us that you can do anything that you want to do . __eou__ Anything ? Do you really believe that we can do anything ? __eou__ If you really want to do something and you work hard at it , I believe you can do it . __eou__ You said she was strict . Did she have a lot of rules ? __eou__ She had some rules that helped us to feel comfortable . For example , the students had to treat each other with respect , or they would be disciplined . __eou__ I see . She sounds like she really cared about her students . __eou__ Yes . She treated us all fairly . She don ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets . __eou__ Really ? Doesn ’ t every teacher have a teacher ’ s pet ? __eou__ Well . To be honest , I usually sucked up to teachers because I wanted them to give me good grades . However , Miss Baymler didn ’ t treat me any differently . She really didn ’ t have any teacher ’ s pets . __eou__ Do you know what she is doing now ? __eou__ As a matter of fact , I do . After she taught our class , she got married and moved to another city . Then , she started writing children ’ s book . __eou__ Have you ever read one of the books ? __eou__ Of course ! Both children and adults enjoy her books . __eou__ Why don ’ t you recommend one to me ? __eou__ ok ! I ’ ll bring one to you next time . __eou__
What is your strongest trait ? __eou__ Adaptability and sense of humor . __eou__ How would your friends or colleagues describe you ? __eou__ ( Pause a few seconds ) They say Mr . Chen is an honest , hardworking and responsible man who deeply cares for his family and friends . __eou__ What personality traits do you admire ? __eou__ Honest , flexible and easy-going . __eou__ What leadership qualities did you develop as an administrative personnel ? __eou__ I feel that learning how to motivate people and to work together as a team will be the major goal of my leadership . __eou__ How do you normally handle criticism ? __eou__ Silence is golden . Just don't say anything ; otherwise the situation could become worse . I do , however , accept constructive criticism . __eou__ What do you find frustrating in a work situation ? __eou__ Sometimes , the narrow-minded people make me frustrated . __eou__ How do you handle your conflict with your colleagues in your work ? __eou__ I will try to present my ideas in a more clear and civilized manner in order to get my points across . __eou__ To secure employment hopefully with your company . __eou__ How long would you like to stay with this company ? __eou__ I will stay as long as I can continue to learn and to grow in my field . __eou__
Good game ? __eou__ Not bad . But too hot for me today . __eou__ Yes , I know . Kind of hard to concentrate , isn't it ? __eou__ Absolutely . Who were you playing with ? __eou__ Oh , just on my own . I just joined , so I don't really have any partners . __eou__ Really ? Oh , well , in that case we should play together some time . What's your handicap ? __eou__ 16 . Yours ? __eou__ No kidding ! I'm 16 , too . We should definitely play together some time . My name's Bob . __eou__ Jane . Nice to meet you . __eou__ Me too . So , do you like the course ? __eou__ Yes , it's fine . However , I personally think the fairways between the greens are a bit too long , especially for such a hot climate . Don't they have carts ? __eou__ Well , they used to , but they got rid of them because of environmental concerns . __eou__ Oh , that's good . I guess the caddies were pleased . __eou__ Actually , in my opinion , the carts were better because you don't have to tip them . __eou__ Yes , but look at it this way , getting rid of the carts probably gives more work to local people , which is a good thing , right ? __eou__ Possibly , but I still miss them ! What bothers me is that the heat makes the caddies ' life quite hard . One member's caddy fainted last week ! __eou__ How awful , poor guy . __eou__ Right . Luckily it was on the eighteen hole , quite near the clubhouse , so he didn't have far to carry him . __eou__ Oh , my God , you're kidding me ! He carried him back ? __eou__ Yup . __eou__
Where did you get all these barney tour pamphlets ? __eou__ I took them from a travel agency . Look at those nice pictures , lash forest , palm fringed , white sand beaches , crystal blue ocean , they ’ re breath-taking . It is like paradise on earth . __eou__ That ’ s why it ’ s become a very popular holiday destination these years . Someone told me the service there is very good too . Are you planning to spend the holiday there ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ m thinking about signing up for a tour in the travel agency . Their next tour starts the same time as my holiday does next month . __eou__ How many days is the tour ? __eou__ 10 days . When I get back , I still have two days to go before work . Isn ’ t that great ? __eou__ That ’ s a perfect plan . Enjoy yourself . __eou__
I'm pleased to meet you again , Mrs . King . __eou__ Pleased to see you , too , Mr . Brown . __eou__ You've had a good trip , I hope . __eou__ Yes , a very pleasant journey , thank you . __eou__ It's been a full two years since we last saw each other . __eou__ So it is , I've come again to renew our sole agency agreement for another 2 years . __eou__ We shall be pleased to talk the matter over with you . You've done very well in fulfilling the agreement . __eou__ I'm glad you're satisfied with our work . I can assure you we've spared no effort and spent quite a sum of money in pushing the sales of your products . __eou__ Yes , we appreciate your efforts in pushing the sales of our pianos . We can see you are experienced in this particular line . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ But I think the annual sale of 300 pianos for a sole distributorship in Canada is rather conservative . After all , you sold around 400 pieces there last year . You can sell more this year according to the marketing conditions at your end . __eou__ That is the result of our hard work . Well , what annual quantity would you suggest for the new agreement then ? __eou__ 500 pieces . __eou__ No , no . That's too big a number to be acceptable . Let's put it at 450 pieces . And we'll strive to sell more , of course . We wish to add another clause . For every 50 pieces sold in excess of the quota , we'll get 1 % more in commission for our efforts . __eou__ All right , let's fix it at 450 pieces then . And for every additional 50 pianos sold , we'll give you 1 % higher commission . __eou__ I suppose all the other terms remain unchanged . __eou__ We would like to make a specific mention of one more point . As our sole distributor , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own . __eou__ No , certainly not . That's a reasonable restriction . __eou__ Another thing is that every six months we would like to receive from you a detailed report on current market conditions and the users comments on our products . __eou__ Yes , we've already prepared one . I've brought it with me . I'll put it forward when we talk with the manufacturers tomorrow . __eou__ Good , that's all then . __eou__ Good . __eou__
You ’ re not going to believe what happened today . You ’ Ve got to promise to keep it to yourself . __eou__ Sure , what gives ? __eou__ Today Mr . Leo threw Sally out of class ! __eou__ On the level ? __eou__ I ’ ll say . I knew Sally would finally show her true colors . When she got her final test results back from Mr . Leo , she started yelling at him . You should have heard her . I ’ Ve never seen anyone get so upset before . To make a long story short , it seems that Mr . Leo failed her because he caught her cheating . __eou__ That ’ s no laughing matter . That means she ’ ll have to take the whole course again . I can ’ t believe she ’ s going to have to start from the beginning . __eou__ It serves her right ! __eou__
Bang ? ! Bang ! Bang ! What are the Kings doing at seven o ’ clock on Sunday morning ? __eou__ Well , Mr . King is singing . __eou__ Yes , but what ’ s the banging noise ? __eou__ He ’ s standing on a ladder and banging some nails into the wall with a hammer . Now he ’ s hanging some strong strings on the nails . __eou__ And what ’ s Mrs . King doing ? __eou__ She ’ s bringing something pink for Mr . King to drink . Now she ’ s putting it ... OK . __eou__ What ’ s happening ? __eou__ The ladder ’ s falling ? __eou__ What ’ s Mr . King doing ? __eou__ He ’ s hanging from the string . He ’ s holding onto the string with his fingers and shouting to Mrs . King . __eou__ And is she helping him ? __eou__ No , she ’ s running toward our house . That ’ s her ringing the bell . __eou__ Well , I ’ m not going to answer it . I ’ m sleeping . __eou__
Mike , come and look at this painting of shrimp ! It is so simple yet so vivid ! __eou__ Yeah . It is incredible ! Is it the work of Qi Bakshi ? __eou__ Yes , it is . How do you know that ? __eou__ Well , Qi is famous all over the world , isn ’ t he ? Besides I am quite interested in Chinese painting . __eou__ Cool ! What kind of Chinese painting do you prefer , free sketch or claborate-style painting ? __eou__ I prefer free sketch , especially the landscape paintings . I can always feel peace and harmony from those landscape paintings . __eou__ That's true . Chinese art stresses the harmony between man and nature , which is an important part of China's traditional culture . __eou__ I love this art exhibition ! __eou__ So do I . Let ’ s go to other areas to see what they have got , shall we ? __eou__ OK . __eou__
Did you see the picture of the guy on the front page of the newspaper this morning ? __eou__ No . I haven't had a chance to read the paper yet . __eou__ you've got to see it . It's an unbelievable picture ! __eou__ What's so interesting about it ? __eou__ Well , this guy fell asleep on the sofa and when he woke up , half his face had been bitten off ! __eou__ What ? How did that happen ? __eou__ They think his dog was trying to wake him up and couldn't , so ended up biting him in his face . __eou__ Wow . What does his look like now ? __eou__ It looks pretty frightening . He doesn't have any lips , so all you can see are his gums and teeth . Most of his nose and chin are missing too . __eou__ What did he look like before his dog bit his face off ? __eou__ He was actually quite handsome . What a shame . __eou__ What's he going to do now ? __eou__ It said that he's hoping to get a face transplant , but until then , he's looking forward to Halloween so he isn't the only one wearing a mask . __eou__
Please sit down . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ From reading over your resume , I assume your English is quite good . Have you had any experience in the writing field ? __eou__ No , I haven ’ t had any professional experience , but I have always been interested in creative writing . __eou__ Have you ever had a foreign instructor in English composition ? __eou__ Yes , my college teacher was an Australian . She was also our adviser on our English language newspaper . I was the editor for two years . __eou__ That ’ s very interesting . Tell me what you did exactly . __eou__ Well , I planned the layout of the newspaper and then I assigned various articles and columns to other students to write . I wrote the editorial each time . __eou__ What is your aim in going into the field of journalism ? __eou__ To be frank with you , I would like nothing better than to be an overseas reporter some day . __eou__ That can be a rough job , you know . __eou__ Yes , I know that . But I like adventure and excitement in my writing . __eou__ Well , working in an editorial office may not be exciting enough for you . What do you think ? __eou__ I would be glad to do routine work sometimes , if I could be assured of making advancements in the future . __eou__ I think this type of position would be a very good start for you . I am quite sure we can work something out for you , but I cannot give you a definite answer today . We will let you know within just a few days . __eou__ Fine . Thank you very much . __eou__
Hey , Ray , what are you doing right now ? __eou__ Not much . Joann . Do you want to hang out ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I ’ m at home myself right now with nothing much to do . __eou__ Me , too . What would you like to do ? __eou__ Well , we could go to a movie . Have you see Shrek 2 ? __eou__ I have , actually . How about the movie , Million Dollar Baby with Clint Eastwood ? __eou__ Hmm ... I ’ Ve seen that , too . We could go for a walk in the park . __eou__ We could , but it looks like it ’ s going to rain soon . __eou__ I guess that ’ s out . Why don ’ t we go shopping ? __eou__ I ’ d really rather not . I ’ ll be too tempted to buy something that I can ’ t afford ! __eou__ Ok . I guess we ’ d be not do that , either , then . What do you want to do ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . Do you want to go bowling at the new bowling alley on 1st street ? __eou__ I would like to , but I injured my wrist last weekend . __eou__ Let ’ s see . Do you want to go to a bar and sing some karaoke ? __eou__ That sounds interesting , but I can ’ t drink alcohol with the medicine I ’ m taking . __eou__ Doesn ’ t sound like that ’ s be fun , then . Do you want to come here ? __eou__ I don ’ t have a car . __eou__ Goodness , we ’ re not having much luck here , are we ? __eou__ No . do you have a car ? __eou__ No , but I could take the bus . __eou__ Oh , good . Why don ’ t you take the bus to mine and we could play Mah Tiang ? __eou__ That sounds great ! Have you eaten ? __eou__ Not yet . I ’ ll cook dinner and have it ready by the time you get here . __eou__ Perfect . Are you prepared to give me all your money ? __eou__ Huh ? We are going to play for money , aren ’ t we ? __eou__ Oh , right . I suppose so . As long as you promise to lose ! __eou__ Hey ... as long as I ’ m not alone on a Saturday night , I don ’ t really care what I do ! __eou__ See you soon . __eou__ Bye ! __eou__
Hey , Terry , have all the players got here ? __eou__ Yeah , most of them have arrived . Don't worry . There are still 20 minutes left before the match . __eou__ OK . By the way , the stadium is terrific . __eou__ Of course . It's a newly-built one . __eou__ We are lucky to play in a new stadium . __eou__ Hurry up , Benjamin ! Pass the ball to me . I'm good at shooting . __eou__ Look out . Catch the ball . You should dunk besides the three-point line . __eou__ Oh , God ! I didn't touch anybody . How can I commit a foul ? __eou__ Just calm down . It's just a turnover . Make up your mind and we can shoot well . __eou__ Yes , I got it . Come on , Benjamin , don't let him get into the paint . __eou__ No problem , I once played a 2 - meter-high player successfully . __eou__ Really ? You must be ... __eou__ But that game he dunked over me for 13 times . __eou__ That's interesting . Let's hurry up , we should beat them in the first half . __eou__ Oh , look , what's happened to Jack ? He sat down . __eou__ He may be injured . Yes , come on , call the team doctor . __eou__
That was really a nightmare ! __eou__ Honey , what's up ? __eou__ I was stuck between 15th and 16th floors in the elevator . __eou__ Oh , really ? I know that telephone signal must have been shielded in the elevator shaft , so what did you do then ? __eou__ I pressed the emergency button ! And then I stayed in the elevator waiting for the rescue . __eou__ Did you panic at the time ? __eou__ A little bit , but I know that the elevator isn't enclosed . at least I wouldn't be smothered there . __eou__ Was there anyone else with you ? __eou__ Of course , there are 6 other people in the elevator ; they were so scared that someone even started crying . __eou__ So you mean that you were the only brave one there ? __eou__ Yes . I have to call the property management . __eou__ For what ? Complaining about what happened in the elevator ? __eou__ Yes . They should check the elevator regularly . I have to give them something to remember about , and they should also equip fire extinguishers in the building . __eou__ That was just an accident . you are worried too much about it . I think the property management will check the elevator and improve their service from now on . __eou__ I know what you mean , but I'd better remind them again , and also remind them to repair the button in the elevator for the disabled people . That has brought the disabled people lots of inconvenience . __eou__
Do you know the highest mountain in the world ? __eou__ Yes . It is Everest , also called Zhumulangma in China . It is 8,844 . 43 meters above the sea level . __eou__ Wow ! That must be really awesome to stand on the top of the mountain to overlook the earth . __eou__ Actually , it is impossible because the mountain is covered with snow all year around . And is has heavy fog for most of the time . __eou__ Have people set foot on its peak ? __eou__ Yes , it has been conquered by many people in history . __eou__
Hello Gina ! We've spoken so many times on the phone but's it's so good to finally meet you in person ! __eou__ Hello sir . Good to meet you , too . __eou__ Oh , please don't call me sir . Just call me Jason . __eou__ Ok , Jason . So how was the flight ? __eou__ Pretty good . There was a bit of turbulence while we were over the Pacific Ocean but it wasn't too bad . The worst thing was the guy behind me . He snored all through the night ! __eou__ Really ? But you were in first class ! Nobody woke that guy up ? __eou__ The stewardess said it's not company policy to wake people up for any reason . __eou__ That's terrible ! So you didn't get any sleep ? __eou__ Not much ... but that's ok ... I'm a night owl anyway . __eou__ So , aside from visiting our factory and offices , are there any other things you want to accomplish while you're in China ? __eou__ I'd love to squeeze in a trip to the Great Wall . __eou__ That's not a problem . We can have a company car take you there . It's only about a two hour drive . __eou__
So who does he think he is , anyway , I can't believe the way that my boss has been ordering everyone around lately , I mean , it's now like he is the CEO , or anything . __eou__ Um ... Actually I am guessing you didn't get the MEMO . Your boss was selected to fill the vacancy in the CEO slot . He actually is the CEO now , or will be , as soon as the official press releases and hoopla is done with . __eou__ Yikes ! you are joking , right ? I can't believe it . No wonder he is so stressed and bossy lately . I thought he was just being ostentatious by giving orders to people and all the different departments . What big shoes to fill ! __eou__ No kidding ! When the last CEO left , we were worried about the future of the company . __eou__ What does a CEO do anyway ? I know the CEO makes the most money in the company , but what does he actually do ? __eou__ He is responsible to the board of directors for everything that happens in the company . He or she must give leadership to all company officers , as CEO is also responsible for providing the guidance of philosophy of the company , and acting as official representative , or face of the company . __eou__ Must be one smart guy . __eou__
I think I'm going to go home . __eou__ Why ? We just got here . __eou__ I know , but it's 12 __eou__ 12 __eou__ Three or four o'clock ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I never stay out that late . That's too late . __eou__ But why is it too late ? It's Saturday night.You have nothing to do tomorrow . Why not stay out and drink with us ? __eou__ Were you so wild when you were still in Taipei , Sharon ? __eou__ Yes , I was . And I like living here.People know how to party here . In Taipei , some people know how to party.But here , everyone does . __eou__ What is that they're doing on the couch ? __eou__ They're smoking pot . Don't worry about it . __eou__ Pot ? Isn't that marijuana ? __eou__ Yes , it is . __eou__ But , Sharon , that's illegal ! The police could come , and we could go to jail . __eou__ Don't worry about it . It is true that pot is illegal in America.But the laws aren't as strict as in Taiwan.If people are arrested , and they have a little pot in their possession , they don't go to jail . They just have to pay a fine . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I didn't know you had such wild friends . Do you smoke marijuana too ? __eou__ I tried it a couple times . But I don't like it . I like alcohol better.Don ' t worry about them , though . If you don't want to smoke pot , you don't have to . __eou__ I don't want to . __eou__ That's alright . But you really should have another drink.People will probably start dancing soon . __eou__ I don't know if I can drink more . I already had two drinks . __eou__ You had two drinks at nine o'clock . C'mon , Ann , you are in an American university now ! You have to learn how to drink . __eou__ I thought a university was for studying . __eou__ It is . We study hard all week.And then , on the weekend , we party hard . That's the best way to live . __eou__ Alright . I'll have another drink . __eou__
We should keep Frank at arm's length . __eou__ Yeah . He's known as a sly dog . He's done many people in . __eou__ He hits below the belt . __eou__ And he may cash in on people whenever chances are provided . __eou__
It was really hard for our parents to save money when they were young . __eou__ Most people were living form hand to mouth . How could they ? __eou__ Yeah . They simply had no extra money to save up or for other things . __eou__ Fortunately , things are changing these years . __eou__
Hello , Fred . What are you doing ? __eou__ I'm doing the business online . __eou__ Can you tell me the concept of e-commerce ? Now , many people mentioned the word , ' e-commerce ' , in front of me . __eou__ E-commerce , or Electronic Commerce is the practice of purchasing and selling products or services over the Internet . __eou__ What kinds of channels can you use in e-commerce ? __eou__ We can complete a trade by email , electronic data interchange and smart cards , and so on . __eou__ What are the benefits of e-commerce ? __eou__ Firstly , it can overcome the geographic limitation . And secondly , e-commerce can lower the internal costs . And thirdly , people like us , can also open stores on Internet . __eou__ How things have changed now ! __eou__
Mr . Lee , all ready to check out ? We ’ Ve already prepared your bill , and housekeeping has done a quick check of the room . How will you be paying ? __eou__ I ’ d like to use my Master Card , if I could . Hey , wait a minute ! This is a bit more than I expected . Why is it so high ? __eou__ The bill is itemized , so take some time to look through it and make sure we ’ Ve charged you for the correct services . Most of your extra charges were for phone calls and room service . __eou__ What ’ s this here – “ house stock ” ? __eou__ That ’ s the mini-bar . Each day we check what ’ s missing and restock it . The items you consume are put on your bill . __eou__ I had no idea – and look at these charges for movies ! __eou__ Those are for pay-per-view movies . Each time you selected a movie , the entertainment system prompted you to confirm that you really wanted it , right ? __eou__ Yes , that ’ s right . But I had no idea I would be charged for all this . Thank goodness my company will let me reimburse all this . __eou__
The tea smells good . What tea is it ? __eou__ It's a special green tea named Longing Tea from Zhejiang province . __eou__ What's special about it except its pleasant smell ? __eou__ You can see that it keeps the original color of the tea leaves very well . __eou__ They must have some special methods to do this during the process . __eou__ Probably . I love green tea . It's one of my daily necessities . __eou__ Then , do you have “ tea time ” every day ? I mean , do you drink tea at a settled time ? __eou__ Not really . But I really love to have after-meal tea . __eou__ What's the advantage about tea ? __eou__ There are a lot of them . In hot or warm days , tea helps to dispel the heat and brings on an instant cool with a feeling of relaxation . Moreover , the tea leaves contain a number of chemicals which are good for people's health . __eou__ Does that mean the stronger the better ? __eou__ No . Constant drinking of over-strong tea would do harm to people's health . So don't make your tea too strong . __eou__ Got it . What's the proper time for tea ? __eou__ It's fine for most time of the day . But don't have tea before bedtime . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ It will give rise to occasional insomnia . OK , let's enjoy the tea before it gets cold . __eou__
Hello Mrs Parker , how have you been ? __eou__ Hello Dr Peters . Just fine thank you . Ricky and I are here for his vaccines . __eou__ Very well . Let's see , according to his vaccination record , Ricky has received his Polio , Tetanus and Hepatitis B shots . He is 14 months old , so he is due for Hepatitis A , Chickenpox and Measles shots . __eou__ What about Rubella and Mumps ? __eou__ Well , I can only give him these for now , and after a couple of weeks I can administer the rest . __eou__ OK , great . Doctor , I think I also may need a Tetanus booster . Last time I got it was maybe fifteen years ago ! __eou__ We will check our records and I'll have the nurse administer and the booster as well . Now , please hold Ricky's arm tight , this may sting a little . __eou__
I really do like this dining set.But I just don't know . I don't know if I can do a good job with it . __eou__ It really isn't hard , sir . You just have to follow the instructions . __eou__ What instructions ? __eou__ We will give you a detailed instruction manual if you buy the table . __eou__ I see . But can I understand the instructions ? I'm a foreigner , you know . __eou__ Don't worry about that . Your English seems very good.And our instruction manuals are very clearly written . It's easy ! __eou__ Could you tell me now some of the things I need to do ? __eou__ Of course.First , you must sand the furniture . You sand it to make the wood smooth.You start with heavy-grade sandpaper . Then , you move to finer-grade sandpaper . __eou__ Do I have to sand every inch of the table ? __eou__ The better you sand it , the better the finish will be . __eou__ Alright . __eou__ Then , after you sand it , you use tack cloth to wipe off any dust or sawdust . __eou__ Sawdust ? __eou__ Yes , sawdust is the tiny particles of wood.You could call it wood dust . You must wipe it off.The wood should be very clean before you put the varnish on . __eou__ That makes sense . __eou__ Then you apply the varnish , which is very easy . It is like painting . __eou__ And I can choose any color ? __eou__ Yes , we have many colors to choose from , sir . __eou__ And after the varnish ? __eou__ After the varnish dries for 24 hours , you can put another coat of varnish on . Or you can put the finish on.The finish is hard and clear . It goes on top of the varnish . __eou__ And then ? __eou__ Well , when the finish is dry , the table is done . __eou__ It all sounds very complicated . __eou__ It only sounds complicated . It's really very easy . A lot of people here in America finish their own furniture.It ' s a good way to save some money . And a lot of people even enjoy it . __eou__ Well , I will look around your shop some more . I need to think about it . __eou__ Alright , sir . __eou__
Mom , this is your third bowl of rice ! __eou__ I know but I have no choice . My stomach just keeps crying for more and more . __eou__ Why ? I never saw you eat so much before . __eou__ I've been going to the gym these days . The exercise makes me hungry all the time . __eou__ So your stomach is the one that actually gets a lot of work-out . __eou__ Don't pull my leg . __eou__ This way you'll probably put on more weight . Will you give up ? __eou__ Surely not . I can feel the results . I'm starting to feel different now . __eou__ Then how are you gonna deal with the problem of getting extra weight ? __eou__ I'm planning to meet my personal trainer to have the work-out plan fixed . __eou__ Oh , I've got an idea . Why don't you ask Dad to go with you ? He badly needs some exercise . __eou__ Your father is a bit too timid . He even doesn't know how to introduce himself . __eou__ He can just say , I'm Benjamin . I'm new and shy . __eou__ Girl , don't make fun of your Daddy . But I can introduce him to my personal trainer . Maybe one day he will be a fitness freak instead of a cough potato . __eou__ Who knows ! __eou__
With tomorrow being Labor Day and all , I think it would be a nice gesture to let all the members of laboring staff leave work an hour early . What do you say ? __eou__ What ! That sounds perfectly ridiculous ! Labour Day is a holiday for everyone , not just laboring staff ... and we get a whole day off tomorrow anyway , so what's the point of an extra hour tonight ? __eou__ Well , we all get Labour Day off as a holiday , the real purpose of the holiday is to remember all the people who do manual or other hard labor . It's to celebrate those who work doing what other people might not be willing to do . I think we ought to do something in honor of the common worker . __eou__ So if we did allow the laboring force to go home early , how many people are we talking about ? __eou__ In our company , the loborial force makes up 60 % of our workers . We'd just be letting slightly over half the folks out a little early . __eou__
( A stranger stops to help ) Everything OK ? __eou__ No ! My tour bus got a speeding ticket not ten minutes ago . Now my engine is on fire ! __eou__ I think that's just steam . Your engine's overheated . __eou__ Do you know a lot about cars ? __eou__ A little bit . I'll take a look if you want me to . __eou__ Please . Thank you so much for stopping . __eou__ Yeah , she's hot . Radiator's leaking . Looks like you were running her pretty hard . __eou__ That must have been just before I got the speeding ticket . __eou__ Did you have an accident recently ... Hey , wait a second ! I know this car ! __eou__ You do ? __eou__ I ran into it a couple of weeks ago . What do you know ? Name's Hal . __eou__ I'm Akimbo . Nice to meet you , I guess . __eou__ Boy , I'm sure sorry about your car . Hey , Akimbo , I wonder if you'd like to make a deal ? __eou__ What kind of deal ? __eou__ I'd like to give you cash for the damage to your car . __eou__ You don't want your insurance company to pay for it ? __eou__ I'd rather not . They'll raise my rates . It'll cost me more in the long run . __eou__ If you give me cash , do you care if I don't fix the car ? __eou__ Hell , I don't care . Just don'T submit a report to your insurancecompany . __eou__ It's a deal , Hal . Thanks again for stopping to help . And thanks for smashing my car ! __eou__
Mom , can we get cable TV or a satellite dish ? __eou__ It costs money , dear . What ’ s wrong with the regular television stations ? __eou__ The shows are dull and they ’ re too many advertisements . __eou__ Well , you already watch too much TV instead of doing your homework , anyway . __eou__ There ’ re educational stations too . I could learn while I watched TV . __eou__ Well , that ’ s true , but you ’ d probably only watch cartoons and action movies . __eou__ No I wouldn ’ t ... can ’ t we get cable ? Everybody has cable . __eou__ Well , if everybody jumped off a bridge , would you jump too ? __eou__ Mom ! ! ! Please . All my friends have had it for years . __eou__ Get new friends . __eou__ Why are you always so mean ? __eou__ Because you ’ d end up spoiled rotten if I wasn ’ t . __eou__ I could help pay for it . __eou__ Let ’ s see how your grades are this semester , and maybe I ’ ll talk to your father about it . __eou__ O . K . Thanks , Mom ! __eou__
do you like cooking , Julia ? __eou__ I really enjoy it , especially when it ends up tasting good ! __eou__ how often do you usually cook ? __eou__ I usually make a few salads for lunch throughout the week and I make dinner about 6 times a week . __eou__ that's a lot of cooking . You must save a lot of money by eating at home so much . __eou__ I do . If you cook at home , you can eat healthy food cheaply . __eou__ what kind of dishes do you usually make ? __eou__ I almost always make either a beef roast or a chicken roast with asparagus , parsnips , peas , carrots and potatoes on Sundays . __eou__ do you make a lot of traditional British food ? __eou__ aside from the Sunday roast , we usually eat dangers and mash , toad-in-the-hole , or fish'n chips once a week . __eou__ how about spicy food ? __eou__ my family loves spicy food . We often eat Chinese , Thai , Indian , or Mexican food when we're in the mood for spice . __eou__ what's your favorite dish to make ? __eou__ I absolutely love making mousaka , which is a Greek dish with eggplant . But it takes a lot of time , so I don ’ t often make it . __eou__
What sport do you like the most ? __eou__ I like baseball the best . __eou__ Me too . Did you play when you were a kid ? __eou__ Yeah . I played until I graduated from high school . __eou__ What position did you play ? __eou__ I think I tried every position , but the last few years , I played third base . __eou__ I hate third base . It's scary when the ball is coming at you so fast . __eou__ It was scary at first , but after awhile , I got used to it . If you have fast reflexes , then it's not really a problem . What position did you play ? __eou__ I played outfield . I hated the infield because I never figured out all the bounces . __eou__ I wish I could play again , but there isn't much opportunities around here . __eou__ I'm on a softball league . It's not fast pitch , but it's still fun . You wanna join our group ? __eou__ When do you guys play ? __eou__ We play either Tuesdays or Thursdays . __eou__ Sounds pretty fun . I'll come out and join you next time . __eou__
I am having a hard time at my job . __eou__ What's wrong , Julia ? __eou__ My colleagues quickly get promotions , while I always get sidelined . I don't know what to do anymore . __eou__ Don't give up so soon . __eou__ But I don't know what else I can do . I am willing to work hard . Sometimes I make mistakes and the boss is not happy . __eou__ Mistakes are just a lessons to learn from . __eou__ Tell that to my boss . __eou__ Do you know Abraham Lincoln ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ He grew up poor in Kentucky and barely had a year of schooling , but he went on to become the President of United States . __eou__ He was also assassinated because of his views . __eou__ He is known as American's greatest president . Do you know why ? Because he fought against slavery and secession at a time in history where others were too afraid to do anything . He succeeded because of his ambition and generous spirit . __eou__ Well , if he can become president , then I can at least get a promotion . __eou__ That's the spirit . Never give up on your dream . __eou__
Have you applied for you visa to go to study in the united states yet ? __eou__ Yes , I have . I handed in my application form two weeks ago and I ’ m going for an interview next week . __eou__ Good luck ! I ’ Ve heard it ’ s very difficult to get a visa to go to the united states . __eou__ The application form are quite complicated . It took me a few hours to fill it out . The hardest thing was getting all the necessary documents . That took almost two weeks . __eou__ What kind of documents did you need to present ? __eou__ I had to show document relating to my financial status and of course my education , because I want a student visa . __eou__ Why do you think so many people have their applications rejected ? __eou__ I think that they don ’ t complete the forms correctly or they don ’ t include all the required documents . The embassy is very strict about it . You have to be quite careful . __eou__ Why are they stricter with Chinese people than with other nationalities ? __eou__ That ’ s simple . Many people break the rules regarding their visa conditions . __eou__
We are interested in some precision machine tools . We have some inquires on hand . __eou__ That's fine . We can supply all kinds of precision machine tools . Our products are much admired in the world market and enjoy a wide acceptance in modern industry . __eou__ Can I have a look at your catalogue and the corresponding technical data ? __eou__ Why , of course . Here are some that will show you our latest development . You may select which ever you need . __eou__ I think our users have the impression that your prices are always much too high , compared with those of other supplies . __eou__ Excuse me . It's true that our products do cost slightly more than the other makers , but It's only due to our technological superiority . __eou__ Your products may have certain advantages , but your prices are too stiff . __eou__ If you give us your inquiry , I shall go very carefully into the price and try my best to put you on the best of the terms . __eou__ OK , I'll come back to discuss it to some details after our users have studied your catalogues and price list . __eou__ Yes , surely . We hope to do some substantial business with you . __eou__
Good morning , and welcome to Live Tech . It is my honor to make this presentation for you . Let me begin by explaining some of our digital cameras ' selling points . You will see immediately that they are very stylish , but what you can't see is the cutting-edge technology inside . All of our cameras are light , compact , and easy to use . __eou__ Can I take a look at one of those ? __eou__ Be my guest . Live Tech's digital cameras combine point-and-shoot simplicity with the ability to easily turn pictures into great-looking prints . Furthermore , it allows users to transfer pictures to a computer while the camera recharges . __eou__ Can I take a picture of you ? Seeing is believing . __eou__ Sure , Just push the button , like ... __eou__ I think I can figure this out . Let's see if this works as advertised . Say ' cheese ! ' __eou__ I think you will find these are the best digital cameras on the market today . __eou__ I think the quality of the photos will speak for themselves . __eou__
Tell me , Mr . Han . What do you suggest if we establish long term business relations ? __eou__ Surely it's a sound idea , Mr . Joey . But I have a few questions for you first . __eou__ I am all ears . __eou__ First , can I know something about your financial situations ? __eou__ Sure . As for our financial situation , you can inquire about them in the national bank . They handle all our financial documents . __eou__ Thank you . And how is your business in the clothing business circle ? __eou__ A very good question . It's very honorable for me to tell you that our business relations cover all over the world and they all have very good business reputation . __eou__ Then what do you deal with ? __eou__ We deal with kid's clothing , women's clothing , and men's clothing . You name it we deal with it . __eou__ That's nice . They provided us with convenient choice . __eou__ As for the regular customers , we have some favorable terms for them . __eou__ I'd like to hear that . __eou__ For the substantial regular customers , we offer 5 % commissions . __eou__ That sounds attractive , all right , how about that we sign a one year contract ? __eou__ Fabulous . I will get the contract ready shortly . __eou__
Hi I came in on flight 513 . Everyone else took their luggage off the conveyor belt , but mine didn ’ t seem to be there . __eou__ Let me check the computer . Uh-oh , Looks like your luggage is on its way to Paris . __eou__ You ’ re kidding . What am I going to do ? __eou__ Well , we can give you this lovely shaving kit and call you the minute your luggage arrives here . Just leave us a contact number . __eou__ You can reach me at 13661306917 . __eou__ Thank you . I am terribly sorry about this . It very rarely happens . We do have a sophisticated tracking system , so I know we will find it soon . But we apologize for the inconvenience . __eou__ That ’ s ok . There wasn ’ t anything important in there anyway . The shaving kit more than makes up for my lost luggage . __eou__ Wow ! I have been working here for 15 years and you ’ re the first person to accept a lost luggage situation cheerfully . __eou__ I ’ Ve had a lot worse problems than this traveling so it ’ s really no big deal . __eou__
Ahhchooo ! __eou__ You've been sneezing a lot lately . Are you sick or something ? __eou__ No . Every spring time around April , I'm stricken with allergies . __eou__ I never have seasonal allergies . __eou__ Consider yourself lucky . __eou__ What are all the symptoms ? __eou__ Well , as you just saw , I sneeze a lot . Also , my nose becomes very runny , my throat sometimes itches , and my eyes start to water . __eou__ That doesn't sound good . __eou__ No , it's not . So you don't have any type of allergies ? __eou__ Well , I have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol . It runs in the family . __eou__ Everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol . __eou__ I get it pretty bad . My whole face turns red , including my ears . My eyes become bloodshot , and I start to itch all over my body . __eou__ That's pretty bad . __eou__ But that doesn't stop me from drinking . Ahahah . __eou__
Who's that ? __eou__ Saint Jude-he's the saint of lost causes . Like my cousin , Anna , who can't stop getting pregnant . She's a lost cause . __eou__ Is that your cousin in the back ? __eou__ Yep . She's always got a bun in the oven . She was pregnant before marriage-a real sin in the Catholic Church . __eou__ What about birth control pills ? Don't they work on Italians ? __eou__ Ha-ha . Birth control and abortion are four-letter words in my family . __eou__ And I heard that Italian men have very active libidos . __eou__
We're in big trouble , Jason . Nick is beating us by a long shot . __eou__ Impossible ! Well , I'm not giving up yet . It's not over till the fat lady sings ! __eou__ OK , comeback kid . Here's you last question.How many times did Robin Williams win the Oscar for Best Actor ? __eou__ Hmm . Let's see ... there was Good Morning , Vietnam , Dead Poet's Society , The Fisher King ... Three , right ? __eou__ Nope , sorry ! Actually , Robin Williams has never won an Oscar for Best Actor--only for Best Supporting Actor ! __eou__
Tell me about yourself and your past experience . __eou__ For the past 3 years , I have been working in China East Airlines Corporation Limited . I'm very tolerant of people and have been told that this is one of my strengths . I feel I have a lot to offer as a team member . __eou__ Why are you interested in this occupation ? __eou__ It's always been my dream to be a stewardess . And I like travelling to different places . __eou__ What do you think is the chief characteristic for a stewardess ? __eou__ Well , a stewardess should be friendly , courteous , patient and treat passengers kindly and politely . __eou__ Do you get angry easily ? __eou__ No , I know how to control my temper . __eou__ If a passenger had a accident , what would you do ? __eou__ I would give him or her basic first aid and ask my partner to call for assistance at the same time . __eou__ If you are hired , when can you start work ? __eou__ I can begin to work right away because I am out of work now . __eou__ What are your salary expectations ? __eou__ I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . I'd like to postpone that discussion until later . Maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position and how your commission structure works . __eou__
Come in , please . __eou__ Good morning ! I am Anna Lu . I've come for an interview which was arranged . __eou__ Oh , I see . I am Jack White , Personnel Manager . Take a seat , please . __eou__ Glad to meet you , Mr . White . __eou__ Miss Lu , have you got any experience in restaurant service ? __eou__ Yes . Since I entered college , I have been working at a fast food restaurant as a part-time waitress . __eou__ For how long ? __eou__ 3 years . __eou__ Our restaurant receives a lot of foreign customers . Can you serve them in English ? __eou__ That's why I applied for this job . Now I am studying Hotel English in my college , and I am quite familiar with the western courtesy and restaurant etiquette . I am sure my public relation skills will leave a strong impression on your customers . __eou__ You must know our working hours are very long and overtime work is frequent . __eou__ I don't mind that . __eou__ I think I will give you a 3 months ’ trial . The salary for this period is 800 yuan a month with no bonus . After that period if we both feel satisfied , a formal contract would be signed . __eou__ When am I supposed to start working ? __eou__ Next monday . Bring your resume and diploma with you . __eou__ Yes , I will . Thank you , Mr . White . Goodbye ! __eou__ Goodbye ! __eou__
Have you decided what you are going to take next semester ? __eou__ Well , I'm an English major , you know.So I came here to make sure I'm taking the right things . __eou__ Good . I think it's a good idea . Our department should require meetings like this . __eou__ I want to finish my degree in four years.So I don't want to forget to take classes I need . I have a friend who has to stay in college another year.She didn't know until recently . There were some classes she needed to take to graduate.She didn't know about them . __eou__ Yes , that happens . __eou__ I brought my transcript from my first year.Here . And here is the list of courses I plan to take in the fall . __eou__ Alright . Good . I see you've already taken six credits of your breadth requirements.You have one botany class and one chemistry class . And political science.So that's nine credits . Did you take English Composition 201 ? __eou__ No , I don't need to . I took Advanced Placement English in high school.So I'm not required to take composition . __eou__ Excellent . I see you have the 18th century poetry class for next semester.And the modern novel class . You haven't taken a Shakespeare class yet . __eou__ No , I thought I would take it later . __eou__ Actually , I recommend you take Shakespeare sooner rather than later . __eou__ Well , I suppose I could cross out the 18th century poetry class . I have to see when the Shakespeare class meets . __eou__ Let me look at the timetable.Shakespeare meets Monday , Wednesday and Friday at 11 __eou__ I can take it then . I have that time slot free . __eou__ Good . I recommend it . Shakespeare is of course enormously important.We want our students to take the class as soon as they can.And Professor Friedman is an excellent teacher . __eou__ I'll take it then . __eou__ Tell me , Lisa , what made you decide to be an English major ? __eou__ I want to be an English professor in the future . I love studying literature , and I want to teach it . __eou__ Really ? That's great to know . __eou__ That's the reason I want to finish my B . A . in four years.Because I know I will be in school a long time . I want to start the M . A . and Ph . D . program as soon as possible . __eou__
Wasn't that a great flick ? I was on the edge of my seat through the whole movie . __eou__ I would say it was a typical run-of-the-mill Hollywood thriller . __eou__ Well , I'm no movie expert , but those special effects were impressive by any standards . __eou__ Special effects ? Baloney ! That movie was made on a shoestring budget . They've been using trick photography like that for years __eou__ Okay . But you have to admit that it was an exciting story , especially with that surprise ending . __eou__ You should read the book . The original story is much better and has a different twist at the end . __eou__ Oh , really ? How does the book end ? __eou__ Read it yourself and find out ! __eou__
My friend finally dumped her boyfriend , and she's sworn she's going to abstain until she finds the right man to marry . __eou__ After going through an episode like that I'm not surprised . How's her headspace ? __eou__ She's doing great , she's getting her confidence back , and her self-esteem , has improved drastically.She ' s very happy . __eou__ I'm proud of you for standing by her . I think you've helped make a big difference in her life . __eou__ Do you have any plans for next Sunday evening ? __eou__ No , why ? __eou__ My friend , who had the mishap , wants to take us to dinner to show her gratitude for helping her . __eou__ She doesn't need to do that , I didn't do anything . __eou__ She feels you gave me the freedom to be able to assist her and she appreciates that . Come on , Let's indulge her . __eou__
Hi Amanda , how are you ? I've missed working with you and the whole gang since my transfer last week . __eou__ We've missed you too . The office just isn't the same without you . How is your new job ? __eou__ It's great . I really get to focus on what I like to do and everyone has been very nice and welcoming . However , I'm having a small problem with my new colleagues . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ Well , three people are celebrating their birthdays this month and the policy here is for everyone to contribute ten dollars to a card and cake for each person . __eou__ Wow , so you'll be out thirty dollars on your first week at work ! __eou__ I know . It is a lot of money and I haven't gotten to know any of the people celebrating their birthdays well enough yet . At our old department , it was only three dollars for each birthday and there were only ten of us . __eou__ Well , every department is different . You wouldn't want your new co-workers to think you're a Grinch , right ? __eou__ What is that ? __eou__ A Grinch is a person who spoils the mood at a happy occasion by being selfish or unenthusiastic . You know - a party proper . __eou__ I definitely don't want to be that ! But , I still think it's unreasonable for them to ask me for such a big sum of money when we don't know each other very well . What should I do ? __eou__
Hi there , I'm Steve Saunders.What ' s your name ? __eou__ I'm Patti Whitney.Isn ' t this convention great ? __eou__ Yes it is , better than I expected it would be.The presenters have been first rate.Is this the first conference you've been to ? __eou__ No , I've been coming for the last 3 years.Each year keeps getting better.Where are you from ? __eou__ I'm from Long Island , New York.What about yourself ? __eou__ I'm from the other side of the coast--Los Angeles . __eou__ Wow . I really like California ... the weather there is much better than the East Coast . __eou__ Have you been to California ? __eou__ Just once.Quite a few years ago we took the kids to Disneyland on our vacation.They had a blast . __eou__ How many kids do you have ? __eou__ Two , a boy and a girl.They ’ re already grown now . __eou__ Well , California ’ s changed over the last little while.You should come back out sometime . __eou__
This is our Submission of Tender which includes the information about volume of the project , the cost and so on . __eou__ OK ! We'll see it . __eou__ What kind of guarantee are you going to provide for us ? __eou__ We can provide you with standby letter of credit established by Bank of China . __eou__ Should we pay earnest money ? __eou__ Yes , you are supposed to pay it on time . If you don't furnish a tender bond on time , your tender will not be considered . Besides , you also should provide derailed engineering of the good . __eou__ Where do we submit the tender ? __eou__ To our office which is on the third floor . __eou__ Oh , I see . By the way , is tender-opening done publicly ? __eou__ Yes . All the bidders will be invited to join us to supervise the tender-opening . __eou__ And are the prices stated in the US dollar ? __eou__ Yes , so far as we know , in the field , your company has lots of experience and we hope you will consider the tender seriously . __eou__ OK ! We will . Bye ! __eou__ Bye ! __eou__
Let ’ s play a little game . I ’ ll describe someone and you try to guess who it is . __eou__ Ok . I ’ m really bored at the moment . __eou__ Ok . This man is tall and slim . He ’ s got blue eyes and curly brown hair . __eou__ Does he have a moustache or a beard ? __eou__ Good question . Yes , he has a moustache , but no beard . __eou__ Sounds like Mike , is it ? __eou__ Yes , it is . You describe someone we both know . __eou__ Right . She ’ s not very tall and she ’ s quite plump . She ’ s got blonder hair , but I don ’ t know what color her eyes are . __eou__ Is she attractive ? I don ’ t think I know anyone like that . __eou__ Well , I don't find her attractive , but I'm sure you will disagree . __eou__ I like slim girls , so I doubt I would find a plump girl attractive . You ’ ll have to give me some more information . __eou__ She ’ s got tiny feet and wears really unfashionable shoes . In fact , she wears unfashionable clothes too . __eou__ This doesn ’ t sound like anyone I know . I give up . Teel me who she is . __eou__ She ’ s your mother ! __eou__ How embarrassing ! I don ’ t even recognize a description of my own mother ! How important do you think appearance is ? __eou__ I think that unfortunately it ’ s more important than a person ’ s character . Advertising and stuff tells us that we have to be attractive . I think it ’ s wrong , but that ’ s the way the world is now . __eou__ I ’ m afraid you ’ re right . I chose my girlfriend because she has a wonderful personality . __eou__ Well , you certainly didn ’ t choose her because of her looks ! Hey , I was joking ! Don ’ t hit me ! __eou__
Wow , the view from the peak is so grand ! __eou__ Look , most of the maple leaves have turned red . __eou__ Did you ever see this kind of beautiful scene ? __eou__ Of course , my father used to take me to Kiang Shan or somewhere like that as a child . __eou__ But my father did not . He didn't have much time . __eou__ Honey , I'm sorry . I promise you , this summer vacation , I will take you to Huang-Shan Mountains . It is more beautiful and magnificent . __eou__ Really ? It's a deal . Have you ever been there ? __eou__ Yes , I went there five years ago . You were still a baby at that time . __eou__ It really gets me interested . Is it higher than Kiang Shan ? __eou__ Surely . You can enjoy the beauty of numerous streams and waterfalls . The sea of clouds has a fairy tale beauty . __eou__ Can I see the rainbow ? __eou__ That depends . If you are lucky , you can see a vivid rainbow across over two peaks . __eou__
Excuse me . Can you tell me how to get started using these machines ? __eou__ Of course . Are you a new member here ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Welcome . My name is Johnson . __eou__ Nice to meet you . __eou__ Do you have any experience using weights ? __eou__ No , I don't . So I need some help . __eou__ Well , first it is important to go through a good stretch.You must warm up properly so that you don't hurt yourself on the machines . __eou__ Yes , I know that.Derek just led me through the warm up in the aerobics room.So I'm ready , I think . I can start using the machines . __eou__ Alright . Great . Then we must get a card for you . __eou__ What do you mean--a membership card ? I already have one . __eou__ No . Not that . I mean a training card.The card allows you to keep track of how much weight you use on each machine.Here , let me show you . __eou__ I'm ready . __eou__ Now , you can see that on this card there are all the machines listed.So , when you go through the series of twelve machines , you enter in the number of repetitions you do.And you also enter in the weight at which you set the machine . __eou__ I see . So this card helps me to keep track of my progress . __eou__ Yes . And it also reminds you what is a suitable weight for each machine.Today , I will go through the machines with you one by one . I will show you how to use them.And we will determine what is a good starting weight for you . __eou__ Alright . Great . __eou__ So you write your name and member number at the top of the card.And then , after you exercise each time , you file the card here . __eou__ Great . Why don't we start on the machines ? __eou__ Are you alright ? Can you do more ? __eou__ I'm sorry . I know there are still seven machines . But I'm exhausted . __eou__ That's okay . Don't worry.It ' s important not to push yourself . Especially not at the beginning . __eou__ What can I do though ? I don't know the proper settings for the rest of the machines . __eou__ We can just go through them next time . It's no problem . Really.The most important thing is to know your limits.So if you feel burned out now , it is good to stop.Because if you strain a muscle or hurt your back , then you won't be able to exercise for a couple weeks . Right ? __eou__ Yes . I suppose it's best to stop . __eou__
Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work . It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other . __eou__ If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company . __eou__ Beneficial ? I don ’ t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating . __eou__ But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency . __eou__ I doubt that . __eou__
Kate , will you please make ten copies of this report ? __eou__ I'd like to , but the photocopier is out of order . __eou__ Then use the xerox machine . __eou__ It broke down one year ago . __eou__ Oh , forget it then . Hey , I told you to put the files on the in tray , not on my desk . __eou__ The pile is over ten feet high . I am afraid it will fall all over and bury you underneath it if I put this file on top of it . __eou__ Very funny . What's wrong with you today ? You are my secretary and you are not supposed to talk to me in that tone of voice . Do you know that ? __eou__ What do you expect ? I've been working for you for three years , and you've never given me a holiday . I don't feel well today , because I have a terrible headache . I am not in the mood for being gentle and polite . If you can't stand it , it's your problem . I am not going to change , because I think it suits you best . __eou__ Keep your voice down , Kate . I know you've had a hard day today , but you should at least show some respect for me . If you really don't feel well , go home . There isn't much work today anyway . __eou__ I apologize for forgetting myself , but I do need some time off . __eou__
Excuse me , i am a new student here . Could you tell me where the English Department is ? __eou__ It is in that brand new , tall building over there . On the 9th floor . __eou__ Where is the school cafeteria ? __eou__ It is the basement of that red building in front of the tower with big bells . __eou__ Where is the Computer Center ? __eou__ The Computer Center is on the first floor of the library . __eou__ Where is the library ? __eou__ The library is next to the Adminstration Building . The Adminstration Building is over there near the school ’ s main entrance . There are school maps for free in the lobby of the Admin . __eou__ Thank you . I will go get one . __eou__ Sure . Glad to be of service . By the way , my name is Mike Sullivan . You will see me around a lot . I am running for President of the Student Government . __eou__ Well , hi ! My name is Eve Markowski . I am glad to meet you . With your friendly smile and helpful attitude . I am sure you will win . __eou__ Thanks you for the encouragement . __eou__ You are welcome . I ’ d better go . Goodbye . __eou__ Have a good day . Bye-Bye ! __eou__
See how many people are here ! __eou__ Yeah ! Do all these people work in the company ? Everyone and their dog is here ! __eou__ Other than the employees , our boss Jack invited some friends of the company . __eou__ Can we just sit wherever we want ? __eou__ Of course not ! We have to sit at our assigned seats . I think our table is over there in the back . __eou__ Hmm . We don't exactly have the best seats in the house , do we ? __eou__ Look who you get to sit next to--Tim from purchasing ! __eou__ Www ! That weirdo ? ! He really gives me the creeps ! __eou__ Don't worry . I'm also sitting next to you . __eou__ I just hope he doesn't start bragging again ! __eou__ I can't wait until we get our year-end bonus ! __eou__ Me , either ! Who decides how much money we get ? __eou__
I am afraid the label is not quite suitable for this locality . Could you quote us for the order with neutral cases ? __eou__ I am afraid not . We usually design the label ourselves . You know we should be responsible for the brand labels of our goods . __eou__ In that case , we'd like you to make some changes in the labeling . __eou__ What are they ? __eou__ First , the languages on the label should be in both English and French . Second , the red color doesn't suit our national customs . Could you print the label in some light colors such as yellowish or bluish ? __eou__ That can be easily done . Is there anything else ? __eou__ The brand name and the nice artwork need not be changed , but the net weight must be placed on the lower part of the panel . __eou__ We'll get the factory to meet your requirements . __eou__ Thanks for your help . __eou__
Who is that guy ? __eou__ It's Clive of course . Where did you come from ? Every girl knows Clive ! __eou__ Really ? He is my type . __eou__ He is everybody's type . __eou__ What position does he play ? __eou__ Shooting guard . The same as Michael Jordan ! __eou__ Oh , I love Michael Jordan . He fills people's lives with great excitement . __eou__ Used to . But now he is too old to play in a fierce game like this . But Kobe is the upcoming superstar now . __eou__ Kobe is a good player but I heard he is a womanizer . __eou__ That is not true . They are just jealous of him ! __eou__ Jordan is a legend , anyway . An idol that no one can replace . I think Clive can make a good professional basketball player . He is not just about muscles he also plays smart . __eou__ You know what , he is also an outstanding football player . He is surely to be a star of tomorrow . __eou__ By the way , do you know if he has a girl friend ? __eou__ You are so not here ! His girlfriend is one of the cheer leaders . __eou__ Oh , My chance is slim then . __eou__
Come in , Arnold . Have a seat . __eou__ Good morning . __eou__ Would you like something to drink ? __eou__ No , thank you . I just had two cups of coffee at my desk . __eou__ So , you're a serious coffee drinker . __eou__ Yes , it keeps me going . Sometimes I think I'm addicted . __eou__ Well , coffee isn't such a bad thing.Everyone has to have something.For me , it's cigars . Are you a cigar smoker ? __eou__ No , I've tried them . But I'm not really a smoker . __eou__ Well , what would you like to talk to me about ? __eou__ I wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal . __eou__ I'm glad when people have new ideas around here . Tell me about it . __eou__ It is about the staff meetings.You know how we have a staff meeting every Tuesday . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Well , I have been thinking about it.And I believe we could do things more efficiently here . __eou__ What do you suggest ? __eou__ The way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week.We meet for one hour . But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation . __eou__ You mean because people have to go across town to get here . __eou__ Yes . Some people spend half of the morning on the road . __eou__ That's true . But our staff meetings are very important , Arnold . I don't know how we can function without them . __eou__ I think they are important too.That ' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them . __eou__ I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . I'm aware of that . __eou__ Here's what I propose . I think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more . __eou__ Well . __eou__ I also think the meetings should be more focused.And I would be willing to take responsibility for that . __eou__ You mean you want to run the meetings ? __eou__ No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better . __eou__ Hmm . But we would meet every two weeks . __eou__ I really think it would work.The meetings could be longer , and better organized . __eou__ I am not against the idea , Arnold.It may really be more efficient , as you say . I'll tell you what we can do.Why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works . __eou__ Excellent . I would be happy to get started on it . __eou__ I will call the managers.Then tomorrow I'll tell you when we can schedule our first meeting in this " new style . " __eou__
How much do you pay wholesale for your products ? __eou__ We have a few different wholesale vendors , so our cost varies a bit over the fiscal year . But the difference is miniscule , a fluctuation of about 0.2 % . __eou__ That must impact your bottom line at least a little bit , doesn't it ? After all , your sticker price is pretty much set in stone . How much do they go for retail ? __eou__ Retail price is 29.95 per unit . We take into consideration changes in supply cost when figuring this price . __eou__ Is that including tax ? __eou__ No , that's the price before tax . The tax rate is varies from different marketing areas , so it is difficult for us to figure in . __eou__ How much is your profit margin then ? __eou__ Our profit margin is in the neighborhood of 20 % . __eou__
I really appreciate your driving me around . __eou__ It's no problem . I have time today , and I think it's important that you find a good place . __eou__ It would be hard for just me to do it . I don't know the city at all . __eou__ So what do you see in there ? __eou__ This one sounds good.Efficiency with view of the lake.Utilities and parking included . Newly remodeled kitchen . $ 470 . __eou__ Can you afford that much ? __eou__ No , I guess not . But that's what I want , isn't it ? An efficiency . __eou__ Yes , an efficiency is a small apartment.Usually one large room and a small bathroom.There is often a small kitchen too . So it's good for one person . __eou__ How about this one ? Downtown efficiency . Furnished ... What does furnished mean ? __eou__ That means the apartment has furniture in it . __eou__ That's good . __eou__ Sometimes it's good , sometimes it's bad . You have to like the furniture . __eou__ Furnished . Parking included . $ 400 . __eou__ It's still pretty expensive . __eou__ Yes , but it's downtown . I would like to take look at this one . __eou__ Alright . What's the phone number ? __eou__ 256-7797 . __eou__ Got it . What else do you see ? __eou__ This one . Two male grad students seeking roommate.Must be quiet . Comfortable downtown apartment.Does this mean I have to share a room with them ? __eou__ No . It probably means they have a large apartment.Probably a living room , kitchen and three bedrooms.They need someone for the empty bedroom . __eou__ That sounds alright . __eou__ Yes , it might be an advantage for you . You are a foreigner , after all.If they're alright roommates , you could learn a lot from them . __eou__ Here's the number , 256-4367 . __eou__ Got it.Let ' s call these two and see if we can make appointments to see the apartments . __eou__ Sounds good to me . I really appreciate your help on this . __eou__ Don't mention it , Larry . What are friends for anyway ? __eou__
Excuse me . I have an appointment with Mr . Li at nine . May I come in ? __eou__ Yes , come in please . I am Mr . Li . You must be My Liu , right ? __eou__ Yes , I am My Liu . Thanks . __eou__ I'd like to start this interview with some questions . Why do you think you are qualified for this position ? __eou__ According to your advertisement , you want an experienced software engineer . I think my background meets the requirement of this position . __eou__ Then tell me something about your background . __eou__ My major was computer science when I was at college , and I am quite familiar with Visual C + + and Java language . __eou__ Well , what do you think about the development in computers ? __eou__ The developments in software are going ahead very quickly and more and more problems are resolved by software . In some regions , the hardware is completely replaced by software . So I think the software industry has a great future . __eou__ Have you ever designed any programs concerning network ? __eou__ Yes , I have designed some programs for the network with Visual C + + and I have passed the test for programmers - MUSE . __eou__ Have you got anything to ask me ? __eou__ Yes , can you tell me what's my responsibility in this position ? __eou__ Yes , of course . You would be responsible for the development of software products . __eou__ I see . This is my advantage . __eou__ Good . Have you got any other questions ? __eou__ No . __eou__ Ok , I will contact you in a week . See you . __eou__ Thank you , bye-bye . __eou__
Are you travelling in America ? __eou__ No , I am on business . I will spend half a month for the business . __eou__ What do you do ? __eou__ I am currently working in a foreign company as a salesman . __eou__ I know all the tricks of the trade . It is quite tiring and difficult to be promoted . __eou__ Maybe . But it provides much wider space for me to improve the skills and increase the experience . What about you ? __eou__ I am a reporter at a TV station . __eou__ Do you like your job ? __eou__ Yes , I have good working conditions and I would require a salary at least 15 , 000 $ a year . __eou__ Which kind of news do you catch ? __eou__ I report the social news which means I always interview the citizens of various professions and trades . __eou__ Are you feel tired ? __eou__ Sometimes . News happened out of expectation . Sometimes I have to get up in the early morning while I can't sleep for editing and interviewing . __eou__ You have to experience this if you want to be an extraordinary reporter . __eou__ That's right . I am still wet behind the ears . __eou__
Hey , look at the offer I got in my e-mail . It says that I can get rich quickly while working at home ! __eou__ Do you also believe in Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I mean that you're gullible . You shouldn't believe everything you read , especially on the Internet . __eou__ But it seems like a good idea . All I have to do is first send some money to the person who sent me the letter . After that he'll tell me how to earn much more money . __eou__ Sounds like a pyramid scheme . Have you heard of those before ? __eou__ Pyramid scheme ? What is that ? __eou__ It's a scam 7 that's based on a hierarchy , like a pyramid . The person at the top asks the people below him for money , and then tells them to go and ask other people for money while sending some of it back to him . __eou__ Sounds good to me . The guy at the top gets money and so do the people below him . __eou__ Not exactly . The scam keeps on going , with the people at the bottom paying more and more money until they reach the very bottom . __eou__ What happens then ? __eou__ Nothing . The people at the bottom give their money to the people above them , and they get nothing . They end up losing . That's why it's a scam . __eou__ I see . I guess I should be more careful about what I read , especially on the Internet where you have no idea who anybody is . __eou__
Is there a lot of oil and coal in your country ? __eou__ There is some , but my country is not amongst the leading producers . The oil and coal deposits are in the north of my country . Your country is a big oil producer , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Yes , it is . My country is famous for having that natural resources . We also have a lot of natural gas . __eou__ We have some too . Do you have a lot of coal ? __eou__ No coal has been discovered in my country , but there may be undiscovered deposits . We don ’ t have many metal deposits . __eou__ There are a few in my country . We have deposit of gold , but they are very small . __eou__ When I traveled around your country , I bought some jewellery made from gold from your country . The jewellery told me that there are few gold mines in your country . The gold was found in mountain steams . __eou__ That ’ s right . A few people go panning for gold in rivers . __eou__ You have many trees in your country . That ’ s another natural resources . __eou__ It ’ s a natural resources that we hardly use . Government policy is to conserve those forests . __eou__ I see . That ’ s probably a good idea . Too many forest are being destroyed . __eou__ Is your country ’ s environment being damaged by the oil industry ? __eou__ We have some inspections , but it is very hard to avoid pollution when extracting oil . There has been some damage , but it is under control . __eou__
have you seen the new Cosmo magazine that I was reading this morning ? __eou__ I think I may have seen it on the kitchen table . __eou__ you're right , thanks . There's an interesting interview with a top director about his latest film that I want to finish . __eou__ who's the director ? __eou__ it's Martin Scorsese . You liked his film , The Departed , didn't you ? __eou__ yes , it was fantastic ! Can I read the article when you're finished ? __eou__ sure . You know it has an online edition , too . You should go online to read if you want to read it now . __eou__ that's ok . I'll wait until you're finished . Just out of curiosity , do you have a subscription for that magadize ? __eou__ no . I don't buy it regularly enough for it to be worthwhile . __eou__ how much does the magadize cost ? __eou__ it's almost three pounds now , and I think they're going to put the price up to four pounds soon . __eou__ that's quite expensive . Who is their target audience ? __eou__ Cosmo mainly has a middle-class readership , but I think circulation will fall dramatically if the price goes up anymore . __eou__ I bet you'll still buy it , though . You wouldn't be able to live without your fashion magazine ! __eou__
May I ask you a few questions about insurance ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Now we've given a CIF Shanghai price for some steel plates . What insurance rate do you suggest we should get ? __eou__ Well . Obviously , you won ’ t want All Risks cover . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Because they aren ’ t delicate goods and won ’ t likely be damaged on the voyage . FPA will be good enough . __eou__ Then am I right in understanding that FPA doesn't cover partial loss for the nature of particular average . __eou__ That's right . On the other hand , a WA policy covers you against partial loss in all cases . __eou__ Are there any other clauses in marine policies ? __eou__ Oh , lots of them . For instance , War Risks , TEND and SICC . __eou__ Well , thank you very much for all that information . Could you give me a quotation for my consignment now ? __eou__ Are you going to make an offer today ? __eou__ Yes . My customer is in urgent need of the steel plates . __eou__ Ok , I'll get this rate right away . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Could I speak to Mary , please ? __eou__ This is Mary speaking . Who is that ? __eou__ This is Bob . Where have you been , Mary ? I have been trying to get on to you for the last half hour . Don ’ t you leave your home at 7 __eou__ Yes , I do , but today I went shopping and have only just come back . It is very nice to hear your voice , Bob . I didn ’ t know you were in New York . __eou__ I arrived this morning . I would have rung you before but I have been terribly busy all day attending a conference . It has only just ended . Are you doing anything tonight , Mary ? __eou__ Yes , I am going to meet a client . __eou__ But that is terrible ! I am only here for one night ! __eou__ I am sorry , Bob . If you had told me you were coming up , I would have kept tonight free . But you didn ’ t tell me . __eou__ I didn ’ t know myself till this morning when my boss suddenly dashed into the office and told me to rush up here to attend the conference . __eou__ I thought Henry usually did the conferences . __eou__ Yes , he does but when he was driving up here last night he had an accident and was taken to hospital . So I am doing it instead . Mary , Must you go out tonight ? Couldn ’ t you get out of it ? __eou__ I ’ m free tomorrow but I suppose that will be too late . __eou__ No , I will stay another day.my boss will get over it . Would you like to meet me for lunch tomorrow ? __eou__ I ’ d like to . But Bob , are you sure it will be all right ? I would hate you to make your boss angry or even lose your job . __eou__ It is all right . I will call the boss and tell him I am staying another day . I stayed an extra night in Boston last month and he didn ’ t seem to put about it . __eou__ Why did you stay an extra night in Boston ? What happened ? __eou__ I will tell you tomorrow . See you tomorrow , Mary . __eou__ See you tomorrow . __eou__
Hello , how are you ? I am Jack . __eou__ Hello , I am Amy . __eou__ What brings you here ? __eou__ I saw that your Corollas are on sale . __eou__ Yes , it is really a good deal . $ 1,000 discount . I've never seen a sale as good as this one . __eou__ Tell me about Corollas . __eou__ Sure . It has 1.8 liter engine . This one comes with all power options , air condition , CD player , full size spare tire , automatic transmission and ABC . The window price is $ 17,000 , and I can give You for $ 16.000 . __eou__ Sounds good . How about $ 15 , 000 ? __eou__ You must be kidding ! You cannot get that price anywhere . __eou__ I am serious . $ 15,000 . __eou__ Can you put down a $ 2,000 deposit , and I'll talk to my manager , see what we can do . __eou__ No . Just talk to your manager and let me know . __eou__ Okay , I'll be right back ... Congratulations ! The manager approved the final price $ 15,000 . __eou__ The price is fine if you give me free security system and free carpet mats . __eou__ You are really tough . You got a deal . __eou__ Thanks ! __eou__
What should I get Uncle Teddy ? __eou__ You could get him a tie . __eou__ Are you kidding ? That's the stupidest gift one can buy . I don't want to get a tie . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Everybody gets men ties for Christmas . It's too boring . Everybody buys either ties or sweaters . I want a more unique gift . __eou__ Well , you can buy him a pet iguana then . __eou__ That's a cool idea . At least it would be a surprise.But I'm afraid he wouldn't take care of it . __eou__ He would think you were crazy , Caroline . __eou__ Yes . An iguana is too strange for a gift , and a tie is too normal.So I have to find something halfway between . __eou__ How much do you want to spend ? __eou__ Well , he was very good to me.He helped me edit my essay for the scholarship contest.So I want to spend at least 75 dollars . __eou__ Alright , I have an idea.You know he carries that conservative-looking briefcase every day . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Well , he isn't a lawyer , so I don't think he needs to have a briefcase like that . __eou__ What should he have then ? __eou__ I think he would appreciate having a very fine leather bag.But more like a workbag or shoulder bag.You know , not so hard and square like a briefcase . __eou__ I think that's a great idea . Men look great with that kind of bag.Where can we buy one ? __eou__ I don't think this mall has a leather goods store.So we have to go to State Street . __eou__ Alright . We can go later then . __eou__ We can buy something for Mom and Dad here , and then go buy Uncle Teddy's gift on State Street . __eou__ Good plan . What should we get for Mom though ? __eou__ She said she wants one of those automatic foot massagers . I think they sell them at Sears . __eou__ Alright . We can go check at Sears and see if they have them.And what about Dad ? __eou__ How about the iguana ? __eou__ I think it would be a great joke.But I know we'd have to take the iguana back . And the pet store might not let us.So why don't we get him something else ? Some clothes maybe . __eou__ A tie ? __eou__ Oh , shut up about ties ! Forget about ties , why not ? __eou__ I was just kidding . __eou__
Did you already take the history exam ? __eou__ Yeah . It was hard . When do you take it ? __eou__ I take it tomorrow morning . There is so much material that I dont know what to emphasize on . What types of questions did you get ? __eou__ Mostly on the civil war . You should also study the impact Martin Luther King Jr . had on American society . __eou__ What about Abraham Lincoln ? Did you get any questions about him ? __eou__ I only had 1 question about him . But you might get more . I dont know if he will have the same exam or not . __eou__ Hopefully he will use the same exam , cause Im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war . It is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class . __eou__ If you cant study everything , then that is probably the best way to go . __eou__ Aright . Thanks for the info . I gotta go to the library now . __eou__ Good luck . __eou__ Thanks . See ya . __eou__
I'm really fed up with Larry ! He's the biggest airhead I've ever met.He always makes careless mistakes , and he's a pain to work with . __eou__ You shouldn't be so negative.You ' ll always have some co-workers that are harder to work with than others.But if you are negative and start name-calling in the office , it will make a bad working environment for everybody . __eou__ You only say that because you don't have to work with him.The people in your department seem so capable and nice to be around.Take Mary for example.She ' s smart and enthusiastic . I've never met anyone as cheery as she is . __eou__ Everybody has their strengths and weaknesses.Even Larry.He might be a pain to be around , but he's also very good at staying in budget on projects.Mary , on the other hand , spends our project money like there's no tomorrow.Also , she's never willing to stay a little later at the office.She always leaves at 5pm sharp . __eou__ Isn't there anyone in the office that is a perfect co-worker ? What about Bob ? Everybody loves Bob.Even though he's flesh out of college and still a bit green , he is a great co-worker . __eou__ You're right.He ' s a hard worker , easy to get along with , honest , and he never steals the credit on projects.The only thing he's lacking in is experience . __eou__ Maybe that's why he's so nice ! __eou__
Would you like to come over for dinner tonight ? __eou__ Sure , but I have to tell you that I've become a vegetarian . I don't eat any kind of meat . __eou__ When did you decide to become a vegetarian ? __eou__ I saw a program a few months ago about how animals are raised for human consumption . I haven't been able to eat a single piece of meat since . __eou__ That's great . Do you find that you eat a lot more fruit and vegetables now ? __eou__ Definitely . I've also been buying organic fruit and vegetables , which is more expensive , but much better for you because they don't have any pesticides on them . __eou__ You've really turned into a health nut , haven't you ? __eou__ I guess you could say that . Eating fruit and vegetables helps keep you healthy . I've lost 5 pounds and I feel great ! __eou__ How do you get enough protein in your diet ? __eou__ Well , I eat a lot more tofu , beans , nuts and some fish . __eou__ Well , don't worry about dinner . I'll only make vegetarian dishes for you . Do you like sushi ? __eou__ I prefer cooked fish to raw fish , but if you really like it , make it . __eou__ How about a spicy tofu and vegetable stir-fry ? __eou__ That sounds great . What time should I come over ? __eou__ Dinner will be ready at about 7:30 pm , so you can come over at 7 p . m . __eou__ Sounds good . See you there ! __eou__
Did you see the fashion awards last night ? __eou__ I sat through about half of it but they lost me after that . __eou__ Not interested ? __eou__ Not really , to be honest . Some of what they call fashion looks terrible to me . __eou__ But they are showing what will be all the rage next year . __eou__ All the rage with whom ? I never see anyone wearing these designs on the street . __eou__ Did you know that fashion is cyclical ? __eou__ What , it keeps coming back ? __eou__ Precisely ! For example , Flares were popular for a while , then went out of fashion . Now we can start to see them coming back in again . __eou__ Flares ? __eou__ They're also known as bell-bottoms . They are a type of trousers . __eou__ It's too complicated . I'll just stick to the plain clothes . __eou__ That's fine , but then you'll always look plain . __eou__
How many years have you done business with China ? __eou__ Let me see , about five years , we established our business relationship with Hua Mei of China Import & Export Corporation in 2003 . __eou__ Do you have any difficulties in doing business in China ? You know the Chinese economic legislation is still incomplete ? __eou__ I don't think I have any problem with our Chinese partners . They have always followed the contract strictly . We can do business directly with the corporation . As I mentioned before , the Chinese government is trying very hard to perfect its law . Its commercial legislation provides legal protection for foreign companies . __eou__ Well , it's known that the Sino-American relation is in a dilemma . Does it influence your business in China ? __eou__ Actually not at present . But we are afraid it will . You know policies influence business to some extent . I hope our government will not be influenced by some extremists . China is really a large market . We don't want to lose it . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ You're welcome . __eou__
Would you consider an offer of $ 56,000 per year ? __eou__ What kind of benefits are we talking about ? __eou__ Our standard package includes health insurance , two weeks vacation and a company car . __eou__ Are these things negotiable ? __eou__ Uh ... not normally . What do you have in mind ? __eou__ Vacation time is important to me . I would be willing to give up these other items in order to receive more vacation days . __eou__ What an interesting idea , Ms . Wilson . Would you also be willing to accept a cut in initial salary ? __eou__ Possibly . What do you have in mind ? __eou__
How is the project going ? __eou__ Well , frankly speaking , I am running a little behind . It's 40 % done . __eou__ Do you have any problem during the process ? You should speed things up . __eou__ I have little chance to communicate with colleagues when I have problems . They are always too busy to help a green hand like me . __eou__ Have you ever helped others when they are in trouble ? Most will give a hand to someone who has helped him . __eou__ I did . But I am so depressed because there is nobody that will help me . __eou__ And you should have good co-operation with other colleagues , you know a scientific schedule brings efficiency to the work . __eou__ I see your point , but I seem to be on bad terms with them . __eou__ Cheer up and pay more attention to your colleagues and the things will be much better . I am speaking from my experience . __eou__ Thank you so much . __eou__ And you should read as much as possible to enrich the knowledge . __eou__ That's a good idea . I can learn many useful things from books . __eou__ We're approaching the critical point for success or failure of this project . you'd better speed up and catch up with books . __eou__ Well , I will do it better . __eou__ If you have any problem in your work , let me know . __eou__ Thanks very much . I promise I will work harder . __eou__
How's your job search going ? __eou__ I only started looking for a job a few days ago . __eou__ have you finished compiling your resume ? __eou__ yes , I was precise with every word in my resume ? __eou__ that's good . Don't forget to design the format . An attractive format is as important as the content . __eou__ absolutely , I've highlighted all my strengths and the resume is clear and easy to read . __eou__ good . How about your cover letter ? __eou__ a cover letter ? I've never thought about that . Won't a CV do for my job application ? __eou__ no , a CV is not enough . You should also attach it with a cover letter . Don't overlook it . You're faced with fierce competition in the job market . If your cover letter cannot stand out in the pile of __eou__ sounds reasonable.Even if I'm the right one for the job , many people are applying for the same vacancy at the same time , so I should try my best to catch the Human Resources manager's attention . __eou__ yes , you're right . All your preparation efforts are to help you land a job interview . __eou__ got it . I'll start right now . __eou__
Mom , why do chinese people like to touch my head ? sometimes they even touch my cheeks . __eou__ That is a part of chinese culture , if they think you are a lovely child , they touch your head and say , how cute you are . __eou__ But i donor like it , not a bit , i am not a pet , i am a girl . __eou__ Well , you get used to it , different countries have different manners . __eou__ But i do not like anyone touch my head . __eou__ They are just been in friendly , when you are in Roman , do as the Romans do , that means you need to adapt to your enviroment . __eou__ What if everybody in the wheres goes crazy ? __eou__ Then you might need to pretend to be a little crazy . __eou__ Does this mean that if i might want those new European bitches , i am supposed to wonder run reget ? __eou__ Do you think it is a ~ got give your brain , use it if you really cannot accept it people touch your head , keep distance from them , why not just wear your big flyby hat and ~ is anyone get close to you . __eou__ That is my work , i will try it . __eou__
What's the bonus like at your company ? __eou__ Well , it's OK , I suppose . We get about the equivalent of six months ' salary . __eou__ Six months ' salary ? Are you serious ? That's incredible ! __eou__ Maybe . But you'd be amazed at how little's left after the credit companies have deducted their share from my account . __eou__ Hey , I know what that's like . I bought a BMW on my Visa card . Now the payments really hurt . __eou__ Well , you're lucky that you're still able to make your payments . I missed a credit payment last month . Now my bank account's overdrawn , and the company is threatening to take back my purchases . __eou__ What did you buy ? __eou__ A new home health monitor . __eou__ Health Monitor ? I read an article about that racket.They ' re overpriced to begin with ! Listen , if I were you , I'd let them take back their monitor and spend my money on something more practical . __eou__ You're kidding ! __eou__ No joke ! __eou__ That's something else ! Maybe I'll return it to them . __eou__
Could you just run through the evacuation procedure ? __eou__ Yes , of course . When you hear the fire alarm , which is a very loud , continuous ringing noise , you should go to the nearest fire exit or fire escape as quickly as possible . __eou__ Should we use the stairs ? __eou__ Yes , don't use the lifts . We have regular fire drills so you'll soon become familiar with the procedure . And always shut the fire doors to prevent the fire spreading . __eou__
Hi Mark . __eou__ Oh , hi Stacy . __eou__ How was your summer vacation ? __eou__ I worked over the summer at a restaurant . Have to make tuition money , right ? What did you do ? __eou__ I took summer school . I withdrew from two of my classes last year so I wanted to make them up . __eou__ So are you officially a junior now ? __eou__ Yeah . And I have 5 credits to spare . I only needed to take 10 credits over the summer , but I took 15 because the price was the same . __eou__ That makes sense . So where is Nicole ? __eou__ She dropped out of school completely . __eou__ Really ? Why ? __eou__ She worked at a startup company as an intern and since the business did well , they asked her if she wanted to work full time . __eou__ Wow . She's so lucky . She doesn't have a degree and she already has a job . __eou__ It sounds good now , but I'm traditional . I want the degree , so I wouldn't have accepted the offer . __eou__ Do you know how much they are paying her ? __eou__ I don't know . But I bet it must have been a good offer , or she wouldn't have accepted it . __eou__
Good morning , you look very tired . __eou__ Yes , I nearly didn't sleep last night . __eou__ Did you hold a party or something else yesterday ? __eou__ No , I just watched Supergirl , and it began too late in the night . I was too excited to get asleep after one o'clock . __eou__ I don't like this program , because there are too many constant arguments between the judges . __eou__ The contestants are different . These girls perform in free styles . __eou__ Do you have much time watching TV ? __eou__ I think less than 3 hours . This year I didn't watch any entertainment programs . Too many ads between the programs . I prefer listening to the radio . __eou__ I don't like ads , either . But ads could bring big profits to the TV station . __eou__ If they could make beautiful ads , I could bear . __eou__
Okay , show me your card hand . Here's mine . I have three Kings and a pair of Aces . __eou__ How did you get that ? No need to show you my hand , I lose.This is not as much fun as the music concert we just saw . __eou__ Thanks again for buying the tickets . That was the most exciting live concert I've ever seen . That silver electric guitar was really cool . __eou__ They're quite popular now . Wasn't her voice good ? __eou__ That , My Heart Will Go On . It warms my heart . you know , JanetJackson , Shanna Twain and Celine Dion are so very different . __eou__ Janet Jackson is more pop music.Shania sings country music . Celine just seems to hit all the right notes . __eou__ Have you heard Maria Carey ? __eou__ Yes , l have two of her Cds , l'II lend them to you if you like . __eou__ Excellent . You can borrow my Janet Jackson's CD . It's her new one . __eou__ I hope you have a good stereo . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because you have to hear it really loud to get the full concert effect . __eou__
I'm going over to the gym . I want to do some running . __eou__ Why don't you run outside ? __eou__ Are you kidding ? Do you know how cold it is today ? __eou__ Yeah , I suppose . I guess it isn't healthy to run in this weather . __eou__ No , it's not . Not at all . I'd probably freeze my lungs . __eou__ Wait for me a minute . I'll go over to the gym too . __eou__ You ? __eou__ Yes , why not ? Just let me get my gym clothes together . __eou__ I didn't know you could exercise . __eou__ What do you mean by that ? Everyone can exercise ! __eou__ Yeah , I know . But you ? I always thought you were only good at lifting beer bottles to your mouth . __eou__ No , not at all . I was on the swimming team in high school.And I'd like to do some weight training . They have decent equipment at that gym . __eou__ You're going to lift weights ? Hah ! __eou__ Are you laughing at me ? __eou__ I'm sorry . I just can't imagine you lifting weights . __eou__ Maybe not . But I want to start . I need to get in shape . I feel these past couple months that my energy is low . __eou__ It's true . If a person doesn't exercise , they get sluggish.That ' s why I keep running . Even in the winter . __eou__ So I need to do something too . __eou__ But lifting weights isn't the best thing.You should do some kind of aerobic exercise . __eou__ I know . But I want to start today with a little weight lifting.Then I'm going to buy a new swimming suit and goggles , and every other day I'm going to go swim laps in the pool . How does that sound ? __eou__ It sounds like a good plan to me . I'm still ... I mean ... __eou__ What ? __eou__ I'm still just surprised you really want to do it.It doesn't seem to go with your character . __eou__
Hi , Yang Tang . Come in ! Pretty hot out there , isn't it ? Did you have trouble finding us ? Sit ! Sit ! __eou__ Hello , Mr . Jones , its ... __eou__ Yang Tang , just call me Fred ! Everyone does . __eou__ Ei , OK , er .. Fred . Thank you for seeing me today . __eou__ No problem . No problem at all . Say , it says here in your resume you studied in California . Great place , isn ’ t it ? I studied in California myself . I really enjoyed it . What did you like most about California ? __eou__ Well , I ... I guess the weather . And the people . They were all very friendly to me . __eou__ Yeah , the people are quite relaxed ... Those were some great times I spent there . Well , thanks for stopping by . Are you from King Dao , Yang Tang ? __eou__ Yes , I am . I was born here , and still live with my parents in the same house . __eou__ Is that right ? Wonderful , wonderful . I've been in King Dao for two years now . A great place . Nice people and great beer ! Well , I guess we ’ d better get started . __eou__
You are late again , Maria . The teacher is about to come . __eou__ I know . I have to prepare the supper for the whole family before I leave . __eou__ Oh , Ben has been cooking for us since I started attending this evening class . The good thing is , he has made great progress in cooking . __eou__ The housework is really a big problem for me . My husband is on a business trip to the U . S . now and I have to take care of everything myself . __eou__ How about your one-year-old baby ? __eou__ I've asked my parents to live with us for a while , so they can look after her for me while I am at work or in the class . __eou__ How sweet of them ! I have to work in the day time , study at night , and do housework during my spare time . I really hope I have eight arms and legs , like an octopus . __eou__ Me too . Sometimes I do want to give it up . I can't deal with so many things at a time . __eou__ When is your Adult College Entrance Exam ? __eou__ It's close coming up at the end of this month . That will be no more than 15 days from now on . __eou__ Oh , my Adult College Entrance Exam is also around then . I don't know if I can pass it . __eou__ Why don't you take the CPA exam ? You are already a good accountant , having so many years of experience . __eou__ I just want to study in a college , majoring in economics . I've had this dream for a long time . __eou__
Matthew , do you know much about body language in countries around the world ? __eou__ Sure , I've picked up a few things from travelling around for work . Why ? __eou__ Well , I had a meeting today with a woman from Japan and she wouldn't stop bowing ! I didn't know what to do ! __eou__ Did you bow back ? __eou__ No , I tried to shake her hand , but her hand was so limp I was a bit offended . __eou__ Well , Japanese businessmen and women typically bow to greet each other in Japan . She might have been offended by your strong handshake . __eou__ But she was in America ! Shouldn't she have known that strong handshakes in America signify confidence and respect ? __eou__ Things are different in Japan . You know , in some countries , making eye contact with others is considered rude . __eou__ Is that why she wouldn ’ t look at me in the meeting ? __eou__ I think it's highly possible , yes . __eou__ The meeting really didn ’ t go down well at all . I think I need to read up about intercultural communication before I have another meeting with someone from another country . __eou__ That's a good idea . When you don ’ t know much about other cultures , the simplest thing can offend someone . __eou__ That's so true . It's great that we see eye to eye on this . __eou__
just don't understand why we have to take the subway . Look at this place . It's modern enough . But it's far from lively . __eou__ It's convenient . People in network go everywhere by subway if they don't drive . __eou__ This isn't network , Frida . We are in San Francisco . __eou__ What's the difference ? __eou__ We haven't come here in business but for pleasure . We should go out exciting . What can you see in the subway ? Nothing ! __eou__ What can you see from a tram or a double-decker ? __eou__ I can see people who are walking on the sidewalk . I can see cars driving on the streets . I can see the sun shining and beautiful flowers dancing in the wind . I can even smell the scent of flowers and the freshness of the air . __eou__ But they are not as convenient as the subway . __eou__ You miss the point ! We are not in a hurry to go anywhere . __eou__ Well , maybe you are right . We'll be more amused in a tram or a double-decker than on the subway . __eou__ I'm so glad you can finally see things in my way . Can we leave this dull place now ? __eou__ What about the tickets ? I've already bought them . __eou__ Just throw them away ! __eou__
Hello , Daisy , how are you doing ? __eou__ Fine , thank you . I haven ’ t seen you for quite some time . What have you been up to recently ? __eou__ I have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home , so you wouldn't have seen me . Recently , I've been obsessed with horror films . __eou__ Oh , how can you be infatuated with horror films ? They're so scary . __eou__ Yeah , you are right I used to not watch horror films , but after seeing Silence of the Lamb with Mike last month , I fell in love with them . __eou__ It's amazing . But if I were you , I wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one . __eou__ But it's really exciting . __eou__ Maybe , but I would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . I wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one . __eou__ Basically . you'll watch any type of movie except horror . __eou__ Yep . __eou__ I think you should have a try someday . Maybe you'll change your mind . __eou__ Maybe . After all , I am grown up now . __eou__
Yeah , look at all those new buildings going up ! Mr . Zhang , the traffic is pretty smooth . But we were told the roads from the airport to downtown were quite crowded and traffic jams could be as long as half an hour . __eou__ Yes , they were . But it has already past . The traffic from the airport to downtown has been relieved after the completion of Yan'an Aerial Road . __eou__ We've never expected that Shanghai is such a big metropolis , same as New York city . David , would it be a good idea to rent a car here ? I've got an international driver's license with a pretty good record in the States . __eou__ That's wonderful . OK . I'll remember that . But I have to warn you that you must drive very carefully in the downtown area , for there're no separate lanes for motor vehicles and bicycles in some places , and still quite a few people don't take road regulations seriously . __eou__
There are so many people that the tickets are all sold out ! __eou__ Luckily we got the last two . __eou__ Look , Danny . The Four Great Inventions ! __eou__ Gunpowder , compass , the paper making , and the printing . __eou__ I really admire those who made such great inventions ! __eou__ May , I don't see why they are great . They are just simple things . __eou__ They look simple today . But they were milestones in their times . __eou__ Milestones ? May , you must be kidding . __eou__ Just think Bill Gates , those inventions are as important as the windows system . __eou__ Well , I suppose the ancient inventors made a lot of money out of them . __eou__ No , quite the contrary . __eou__ Why ? Didn't you say that they were milestones ? __eou__ Yes , but they went to the public without any patent protection . __eou__ Well , their inventors were not as clever as Bill Gates . __eou__
I will be accompanying you on your tour today to visit our company . This is the assembly line . These drawings on the wall are process sheets . They describe clearly how each process goes on to the next step . __eou__ How many workers are there on the lines ? __eou__ About 200 . They can assemble at least 3,000 computers every day . __eou__ Oh , it's highly efficient . __eou__ Yes , since I came to this company , I was told that high efficiency is essential for the further development . __eou__ How do you control the quality of the products ? __eou__ Well , all products have to go through five checks in the whole process . We believe that the quality is the soul of an enterprise . There fore , we always put quality as the first consideration . __eou__ Yes , quality is even more than the quantity . __eou__ Mr . Chandler , this way please . I will show you a five-minute multivision about the history of our company . __eou__
Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set ? __eou__ We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? That will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock . __eou__ You can double check with the housekeeping department , but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order . __eou__ OK , I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it ? __eou__ I think the only thing is toner . Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . Anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time . __eou__ OK , will do . __eou__
So you've been attending night classes for a while now . Do you feel it's helping you ? __eou__ Yes , furthering my education is already bringing about positive results in my workplace as it has boosted my confidence.As well the tutoring system my school employs offers courses uniquely suite __eou__ Really ? That's great that you found a school that puts your need first . __eou__ As well my company has been very supportive about my decision.They ' Ve cut back my working hours in order to accommodate my studies . __eou__ That's great . They must really be committed to staff development . __eou__ They are.We definitely see eye-to eye on my enhanced performance being a win-win situation for everyone involved . __eou__
Good evening , Saliva . What's that wonderful aroma from your kitchen ? What are you doing now ? __eou__ I am cooking now ! __eou__ Are you good at cooking ? __eou__ I have studied its skills recently at a training school . I plan to run a restaurant , so I have to practise cooking ! __eou__ It is a good idea . What dish are you cooking now ? ! __eou__ I am steaming fish in a pressure cooker . Have you ever tried steamed fish ? __eou__ Yes , I have . But the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious . The fish is not well-done and too salty . __eou__ That's the case . I think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much . __eou__ I have the same idea as yours . __eou__ It's OK . Please have a taste of it . __eou__ Thank you . Oh , it's very delicious . __eou__ Thank you for your praise . __eou__ Besides steamed fish , what else are you good at cooking ? __eou__ I am good at stewing beef with potato , frying chicken , hot and sour soup etc . __eou__ So many dishes . Next Friday week is my birthday . I would like to invite you to cook for my dinner party , OK ? __eou__ Why not ? It is a good opportunity for me to practise cooking . __eou__ Thanks a lot . __eou__ It's my pleasure . __eou__
Well , everything is packed and ready to go . __eou__ It's hard to believe that we're really leaving . The past two weeks was like a dream . __eou__ Yes . Just think the blue sky , sunshine , mouth-watering food , centuries-old castles - - __eou__ And the people were so friendly ! __eou__ Yeah , we would have been lost without the help of the locals . __eou__ Do you still remember the small restaurant at the corner of the street ? __eou__ Of course . That was the best pasta I've ever had . __eou__ I ate so much that I wasn't hungry until afternoon the next day . __eou__ If only we could eat there once more ! __eou__ Maybe we can come here again next summer . __eou__ Hope the restaurant is still there . __eou__ Hey , what's the time ? __eou__ Oh , my god ! Only two hours left before the plane takes off . We need to be at the airport now . __eou__ Don't worry . We can call a cab . It'll be alright . __eou__
We'd like to welcome everyone to the Michelson Tools factory site , and thank everyone for being here today . My name is Paul Shafer , I'll be showing you around today . Please feel free to ask questions at any point during our tour , I'll be happy to answer questions for you . __eou__ Is it really necessary to wear all this protective gear ? __eou__ That's an excellent question . I'll bet your wondering why we ask you to wear hard hats and safety googles while you's in the plant . The reason is simple , we care about your safety and we want to ensure there are no injuries today . As you will see , to maintain a high level of safety , we also require all of our staff to wear similar protective gear . __eou__ How long will the tour take ? __eou__ It should take about twenty minutes to go through the main plant , and maybe another ten to take a look at the laboratory . All together our tour should last about half an hour . __eou__ Okay ... __eou__ Well , if you don't have any questions , shall we get started ? If you'll follow me , first I'll take you to the site of our semi-conductor system ... __eou__
Good afternoon . I am Mr . Brown , the Import manager of Atlantic Industries Ltd , Sidney , Australia . This is my card . __eou__ Good afternoon , Mr . Brown . My name is Mrs . Anderson , manager of the sales department . __eou__ Nice to see you , Mrs . Anderson . __eou__ Nice to see you too , Mr . Brown . Won ’ t you sit down ? __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ What would you like , tea or coffee ? __eou__ I ’ d prefer coffee if you don ’ t mind . __eou__ Is it your first trip to the Fair , Mr . Brown ? __eou__ No , it ’ s the fourth time . __eou__ Good . Is there anything you find changed about the Fair ? __eou__ Yes , a great deal . The business scope has been broadened , and there are more visitors than ever before . __eou__ Really , Mr . Brown ? Did you find anything interesting ? __eou__ Oh , yes . Quite a bit . But we are especially interested in your products . __eou__ We are glad to hear that . What items are you particularly interested in ? __eou__ Women ’ s dresses . They are fashionable and suit Australian women well , too . If they are of high quality and the prices are reasonable , we ’ ll purchase large quantities of them . Will you please quote us a price ? __eou__ All right . __eou__
Graham , why are you always on the phone with Jane ? __eou__ Because we are partners in our science lab . Why are you so jealous ? __eou__ The other night when you came home there was lipstick on your right cheek . How do you explain that ? __eou__ My aunt Mary just flew in from Cleveland and she laid one right on my right cheek . __eou__ Are you sure ? __eou__ Of course I am . I only love you , Amy . __eou__ Okay , I'm sorry . I believe you . __eou__ Why do you always accuse me like that ? __eou__ Because you are the most handsome boy at the university and I love you so much ! I guess I just go crazy sometimes . That's all . __eou__ Oh , Amy . I am the luckiest guy in the world . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because I am loved by the most beautiful girl in the world ! __eou__ Oh . Graham . I love you so much and I really believe in our love . __eou__
There was something wrong with the plane last Thursday . __eou__ Which flight ? __eou__ Flight 198 . Fortunately , there were few passengers . __eou__ How about the passengers ? __eou__ Well , all the passengers and crew members landed on their feet finally . __eou__
Which church do you attend ? __eou__ I am Mormon , so I go to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints . __eou__ What ’ s the difference between this and other Churches ? __eou__ Mormons believe that , after the death of Christ and the death of the Apostles 10 , their church Christ founded became corrupt and the authority of Christ on earth was lost to men . In 1830 , a prophet named Joseph Smith was brought up by God to restore the church . __eou__ Then does that mean the other churches are corrupt ? __eou__ That means that they all have parts of the original gospel , but not all . __eou__ Do you believe that Mormons have all of it ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Why do you really go to church ? __eou__ We gather together to encourage each other , because we have common beliefs . We come together and call it church . __eou__
Hello , come in , I've been waiting for you . __eou__ Than you , I'm not late , am I ? __eou__ No , no , no , not at all.It ' s just that I've been looking forward to meeting you . __eou__ Well , thank you , but it's not all that hard to do , you know . I've been calling your office and sending you proposals for about two years now , and you've never responded before . __eou__ Ha , ha , ha ! Yes , I guess I deserved that . Let me explain , okay ? __eou__ Please , I wish you would . __eou__ Well , as you probably know I buy from a selected group of suppliers and don't , as a rule , deal with new people . __eou__ Yes , I know that . It's why Ive been trying to become one of those suppliers . I hear you're a good man to do business with . __eou__ I'm very old-fashioned . I believe in loyalty.Once I start a sales relationship with someone , I stay with him or her , and we so most of our business on the phone . I expect their absolute best price possible and don't haggle.But if I find out they screwed me over , then I find another supplier . __eou__ That's pretty much what I heard . __eou__ Well , those are my terms . As long as you honor them , we do business.If you break faith and try to take advantage , I'll find someone else to work with . Can you live with that ? __eou__ No problem at all , Mike . Just give me the chance . __eou__
Do you shop online often ? __eou__ Every so often . It is very convenient and the price is lower than in stores . __eou__ Are there many things online ? __eou__ Books , cosmetics , daily necessities , even large electrical appliance can be ordered from online-stores . __eou__ Incredible . I really want to survey the on-line virtual supermarket . __eou__ Even you can bargain with the owner of one on-line store , although he or she provides ' But It Now ' prices . __eou__ What are the disadvantages of on-line shopping ? __eou__ Some provide wrong pictures for the goods , so many buyers are deceived . __eou__
What kind of car is best for me ? __eou__ For you , I would recommend this one here . __eou__ The compact ? Why do you think that one is better than the others ? __eou__ This automobile is just right for your needs because not only is it compact for ease in city driving , but also , it has many safety features . I know that as a parent , you are concerned about safety in driving your kids to and from school . __eou__ That's true . What kind of safety features are we talking about ? __eou__ This model features anti-lock brakes , airbags on both driver and passenger sides , and impact collision design . But that's not all . This car isn't only safe but it's also very economical . __eou__ You mean it has a cheaper price than similar models ? __eou__ Yes , this price is very affordable , but driving this car you'll also notice a significant annual saving in gas consumption . The main attraction for this model is the fuel economy . __eou__ With the cost of gasoline these days , that is a big plus . I think this model may be just what I'm looking for . __eou__ Why don't you take it for a test drive , and think it over . __eou__
Today people are hearing about information superhighways and the intermet . __eou__ Is this change going to be beneficial for theindividuals like you and me . __eou__ Yes , I think so . My friend once used it mostly to play chess , but now he has learnt how to do other things on the Internet . __eou__ There's no doubt the Internet will be a powerful commercial medium . It'll connect hundreds of millions of customers and open up huge markets for all kinds of products and services . __eou__ That's true . I can imagine companies sending advertisements directly to customers over the net . Customers , in turn , can examine and compare whatever goods they want to buy and tell their computers to find them at the best price offered . __eou__ Yeah . It'll be a shoppers heaven . That's the use of net in E-commerce . __eou__
Sir , I am very glad to tell that we have successfully registered the trademark for our new product . It is the time to think of some effective promoting strategies . We are beginning to get more attention from overseas . __eou__ Well done , Fred . Do you know something useful for our promotion for our I-series ? __eou__ OK , Let me see . I suppose we must strengthen our promotion , because our brand is still new to some consumers . Maybe we should start our advertising program with our local and overseas distributors simultaneously , because they stand on a better position for selecting the best ways to advertise in market places . Besides , the advertisement fund can encourage them to spend more attention on advertising our products . __eou__ That is a good idea to start with . I also think the mass media is also a good approach for advertising . __eou__ Yes , the mass media has wider influence . One of my classmates works in an advertisement company . I can get help and inspiration from him . And we can also try some less expensive approaches of advertising , such as on-line sales . Personally , I prefer to the on-line sales , for it is cheaper , faster and wider . __eou__
OK ! Let's get down to business now . __eou__ Say it . __eou__ As you know , we should work out cautious and detailed plan for our promotion , so as to guide our company to be successful in the new product , L-series . __eou__ That's right . And in my opinion , to push the sale of the new products is not an easy task . __eou__ I know that . I need to discuss this with Arden . And in his opinion , we should widen the scope of our ads , so newspaper and Internet should be adopted in this campaign . __eou__ Could you put it in detail ? __eou__ Well . We plan to contact www . on-line advertising . com.cn and Shanghai Morning Newspaper to discuss the advertisement schedule . __eou__ I think the idea is very good . In the promotion campaign , two or more media are used together , so as to draw customers ' attention and keep hold their attention to larger extent . __eou__ What kind of media do you recommend ? __eou__ I think TV is also an effective media , as long as our company is willing to spend more money on it . __eou__ Well . Arden just mentioned the paper and the on-sales . And I can talk about TV with him later , because TV promotion gets more and more popular among consumers . __eou__ I also think good advertising is essential to call attention to a product and introduce our L-series products . Meanwhile , ads are also the representation of the company's image . __eou__
Merry Christmas , sweetie . How's your brother enjoying Taiwan ? __eou__ Ryan says he wants to stay . I think he's in love with some girl who designs fruit platters ... __eou__ No ! Christmas without him is bad enough . So , honey , do you have cold feet yet ? __eou__ Yeah , especially since Jack didn't take care of the plane reservations . __eou__ You're not coming ? __eou__ Not until the 31st . So can you change the church reservations ? __eou__ I'm afraid not . The church is booked until the year 2001 . __eou__ Then where will we have the ceremony ? At home ? __eou__ We'll have to . We'll rehearse on the 1st and have the wedding on the 2nd . __eou__ I'm sorry , Mom . __eou__ Don't worry , dear . I'm a great host . Now get some rest . Merry Christmas . __eou__ Merry Christmas , Mom . I love you . __eou__ I love you , too . And forgive Jack . He's doing his best . __eou__ I know . Goodnight . __eou__
Hi , Daisy ! __eou__ Hi Simon . Nice to meet you again __eou__ I hope you are Settling in at school ! __eou__ I am ! I've made lots of friends and I really enjoy my courses . __eou__ Good ! Me too ! By the way . you didn't tell me what you are studying here . __eou__ Didn't I ? I'm doing business studies . __eou__ Really ? That's great .

It's too soon to say really . __eou__ What about your friend Zoe __eou__ She's from Australia . She lives in Sydney . Her father runs a hotel business there and she is doing a degree in accountancy . __eou__ Accountancy ? Really ? She must be very good at figures . __eou__ I guess so .

Wow ! So many students crowded in . More than I excepted , we are lucky to arrive in hour earlier . Or else we definedly have problems to getting good seats . __eou__ I learned my lesson from the last experience . I didn't arrive early enough . So I ended up with a terrible seat , All the way up in the front row . It was one of my worst movie experiences ever . __eou__ Yeah , I hate sitting in the front row . __eou__ By the way , it was really thoughtful if you to get me the ticket . I really appreciate it , I'll buy some popcorn , and drinks for us . __eou__ That would be great . __eou__ I'll be back as soon as possible . Oh , I almost forgot I'd better hold on to my ticket stop in case of they let me in . __eou__ Ok . __eou__

I have seen that our wedding , but just mary's . __eou__ Mary looks so beautiful in the wedding gown , and I record the moment that I was bride . __eou__ You are always be the most beautiful one in the world . What is the bridemaid's name ? __eou__ Judy , Why are you so interested in her ? __eou__ Don't be so sensitive , just a casual question , I caught you looking at the groomsman __eou__ He's terribly handsome . __eou__ I wonder why he is chosen to be the groomsman , and why mary doesn't marry him since he's much more attractive . __eou__ Why are you so bitter ? No one tells worse joke than you . __eou__ Administer is doing a good job . I'm not sure they'll be as happy as we are . __eou__
Steven , can you give us a summary about your work ? What do you get from your work ? __eou__ I have accumulated a wealth of practical experience in work as a chief advertisement designer . Moreover , I realized teamwork is the key to success . __eou__ Why do you think so ? __eou__ I think building team spirit among the coworkers is very important . I believe we can accomplish a miracle if we stick together . __eou__ Very good . Anything else ? __eou__ My advantage is that I have strong sense of responsibility . But I lack patience . __eou__ I must praise you for your modesty and diligence . What's your plan next ? __eou__ I will listen and learn more when I start my new job . I plan to become more professional in my field . __eou__ I've got to commend you ; you really did a good job . __eou__ Thanks for your compliment , but there is still plenty more to learn . __eou__

Hello , Chandler ! How are you ? __eou__ Fine . And you ? __eou__ Just so so . I am too tired . My company has been holding too many training sessions lately . __eou__ That's good . Not Evey company provides employees with training opportunity . It seems that your company wants to further develop their employees and encouragelifelong learning . __eou__ Good ? ! For them but not to me . __eou__ So , what's the problem ? __eou__ We have to participate in training after a busy day and during the weekend . You know , after work all you want to do is throw yourself onto your bed . And during the Weekend , you just want to stay at home and enjoy a family dinner . __eou__ Yes , you are right . But one should keep learning daily to maintain our keen mental power expand our intellectual capacity . Constant learning drive us to Sharp our power of reasoning , analysis and judgement . __eou__ Yes , I agree with you on the point but couldn't the training be held during the working day instead of weekend ? __eou__ Yes , you are right . I think weekend is the time for family gathering and rest Maybe you could make that suggestion to your boss . __eou__

There are a few plain as well . Here they are . __eou__ I see . And the quantities . __eou__ 200 rolls of each . Make it 200 rolls for each sample . __eou__ How many rolls altogether ? __eou__ Twenty prints and five plain . That makes 5,000 rolls in all . __eou__ Six weeks , did you say ? __eou__ Yes , five to six weeks . __eou__ We could manage the plain rolls in six weeks . The prints might be put off to eight weeks . __eou__ Eight weeks ? We can wait that long . __eou__ That's the best we can do just now , I'm afraid . __eou__ Can't you make it seven weeks for the prints ? __eou__ What about taking the prints in two shipments ? Two thousand rolls in seven weeks , and the remained a week later . __eou__ That might be acceptable . I shall have to cable our Beijing office to get their approval . You can definitely supply in the time you've given me , I suppose . __eou__ Yes , I'll see that you get those delivery . Shipping by ' S . S . American ' as usual , is that all right ? __eou__ That's right . __eou__ When can we expect your confirmation of the order ? __eou__ As soon as I hear from Beijing , that will be either Friday or Saturday . __eou__ All right . __eou__
Good evening , madam . May I help you ? __eou__ I want a facial . But this is the first time I've come here , so can you tell me how you do it ? __eou__ Sure . Most facials start with a thorough cleaning . Then we usually use a toner to invigorate the skin , followed by exfoliation treatment-a peeling mask or scrub that removes the dead cells that make the skin lock dull . After that , we'll massage your face and neck with oil or cream to improve the circulation and relieve the tension , followed by a mask to moisturize and soften the skin . __eou__ That's exactly what I want . How long does it take ? __eou__ We have half-hour and one-hour treatments . __eou__ What's the regular price ? __eou__ Well , the half-hour facial costs 50 yuan and the one-hour costs 80 yuan . If you want make-up , another 20 yuan will do . __eou__ Good , I will take the one hour facial with make-up . __eou__ That's fine , madam . __eou__ By the way , could you give me a manicure ? Use a light nail-polish , please . __eou__ Yes , madam . __eou__
What is my ideal weight ? __eou__ It depends on your height and body type . __eou__ How can I avoid injuring myself during exercise ? __eou__ By warming up before and cooling down after your workout . __eou__ Sir , tell us about your experience with Super Bulk-up . __eou__ Well , it's completely changed my life . __eou__ Tell us how . __eou__ Well , before , I was the skinniest guy on the beach . __eou__ And now ? __eou__ Just look ! In six short weeks I've put on 30 pounds of pure muscle . __eou__ Wow ! All because of Super Bulk-Up . __eou__
The results of the poll show Bill Clinton's approval rating has gone up in his second term . Do you find that interesting ? __eou__ Well , I think Clinton deserves high marks for doing his job generally , but he may get low marks for his honesty and personal image . __eou__ That is exactly what the poll shows . Although the stating of Clinton as a person has gone down in the last two years of his term , his approval rating is as high as 66 percent . __eou__ I don't find this surprising . The poll data sound quite right . He is a good president . __eou__ But the poll says only 15 percent say he will be remembered as an outstanding president . __eou__
Hey , Shirley ! Want to join me for lunch ... my treat ! __eou__ Wow ! Sure ! __eou__ I must confess I have an ulterior motive for asking you to lunch . __eou__ Oh ... that's OK ... as long as you're buying ! __eou__ I really want to pick your brain about something I've been thinking a lot about . __eou__ I'd love to help if I can . __eou__ Well , as you know , I have a Bachelor's degree in English literature and that's served me well so far , but I've always wanted to do some post-graduate work ... maybe even get a Doctorate ! __eou__ Wow ! Just the idea of going back to school fills my head with pain . __eou__ But you have a Master's degree ... hasn't that helped your career ? __eou__ Yeah , I'd have to say it has . But I'm still paying for it , you know . __eou__ I know education is expensive , but it's been my lifelong dream . Call me crazy , but I've always wanted to have that PhD at the end of my name . __eou__ Well , getting a Doctorate degree would mean close to a decade of school . Can you afford that ? Can you survive that ? __eou__ I certainly can't afford it , but I'm sure I could find some good student loans . __eou__ I think you need to separate the dream of having a PhD from the reality of years of more schooling . It's not as romantic as you might think . __eou__ Yeah ... I keep thinking about what I'll do with a Master's or Doctorate . I love language but I don't think there are a lot of well-paying jobs out there for experts on Shakespeare . __eou__ Uh huh , that's for sure . You might find that your only career choice is teaching other graduate students . __eou__
Shall I punch out for you , Ross ? I am leaving now . __eou__ No , thanks . I have got to work overtime . __eou__ But today is Friday . You are not going to work overtime on Friday evening , are you ? __eou__ Well , I am . I'll have to finish this report for next Monday's meeting . Is Tom coming to pick you up ? __eou__ No . We ’ ll meet at my house . He invited my family to spend the weekend with his family at their villa . __eou__ That's nice . Where is his villa ? __eou__ It's not his villa , but his father's . I think it's somewhere in Florida . I am not sure myself . __eou__ Sometimes I envy you a lot . Tom is a good guy . __eou__ Come on . You just haven ’ t met the right person and I think that you work too much . You should learn how to entertain yourself and enjoy life . __eou__ I know , but I am a work maniac . __eou__ Well , suit yourself . I've got to run now . __eou__ Have a nice weekend . __eou__ You too . Oh , I forgot to tell you one thing . A girl called this afternoon . She said she was your ex-girlfriend . She wanted you to call her back . __eou__ Did she mention anything else ? __eou__ No , nothing else . See you Monday . __eou__ See you . __eou__
I heard you were teaching English over there.Tell me about it . Did you like it ? __eou__ Oh , yes , it was very interesting . __eou__ What were the schools like ? __eou__ Oh , I didn't actually teach in the schools . I taught after school . I taught in English institutes . __eou__ But you taught children , yes ? __eou__ Yes . That's right.But children in Taiwan are very different from children in America.At least as far as studying is concerned.Many children in Taiwan go to special institutes after school . __eou__ They actually study after school ? __eou__ That's right.After their school day is over , they go to a special institute to study math or English.They are very serious about learning over there . __eou__ Hmm . That sounds pretty oppressive for the kids . Don't they ever relax ? __eou__ Of course they do.You know , Eliza , before I went over there I thought the same thing . I thought that maybe kids in Taiwan study too much.But now that I've worked there , and taught them , I feel it is a good thing.Their parents are very concerned about their education . More than American parents are . And that is good . American kids don't study enough . __eou__ Asian cultures value learning very much . I know that . __eou__ So it was interesting for me to see parents very concerned about education.They would come to me after the class and ask how their son or daughter was doing . I don't think that's a bad thing . I think it's a good thing.In America , too many parents don't pay attention . __eou__ But aren't the kids tired out ? I mean , they go to school all day , and then they go to school in the evening too . __eou__ As an English teacher , I tried to make the lessons as fun as possible . I tried to have a good time with my classes . The students often enjoyed it.And if the students enjoyed it , they learned more . So it was a good experience . __eou__ Are the kids in Taiwan very obedient ? __eou__ That's a stereotype we Americans have.We think that Asian kids are very obedient and quiet.But it's not true . There are plenty of naughty kids too . __eou__ Hmm . I know you taught in Costa Rica also.Which did you like better--Costa Rica or Taiwan ? __eou__ I don't know . In Costa Rica , I taught adults.So it was a very different thing . So I really can't compare . __eou__
do you have internet in your room ? __eou__ sure , I am a total internet junkie , I can't survive without internet . __eou__ really ? What do you usually do online ? __eou__ well , there are a lot of things , like reading news , email , shopping , etc . but mostly I chat online . You could say I'm addicted to online chatting . __eou__ I never chatted online before . What's it like . __eou__ well , basically it's similar to face-to-face chat , but you type instead of talk . You should try it at least once . __eou__ really ? Who do you chat with ? __eou__ to people all over the world ! I have a lot of net pals . See , the magic of internet is that it connects people from all over the world . You can chat with someone thousands of miles away as if they were __eou__ that's amazing . I will install an online messenger program when I get home . __eou__ well , my suggestion for a newbie like you is that don't get lost in the cyberspace . You know internet won't do the filtration for you , so you still need to use your judgement . There are a lot of per __eou__ don't worry . __eou__
Do you want to sign for a Korea language class ? __eou__ What for ? Oh , I see , you mean next year our company will expand business to the South Korea market . __eou__ Right , we have located a business partner in Seoul . The first contact proves to be successful . The general manager of South Korean company has scheduled to pay a visit to us next month . I think it is quite possible to set up a joint venture company with them soon . __eou__ Well , sounds promising . But I think our company will provide us with the language training courses if it is necessary . We need not bother signing for the language by ourselves . __eou__ A slow sparrow should make an early start . You know , I am not quick at learning any language . __eou__
IBA , Maria speaking . How can I help ? __eou__ Hello , I called earlier regarding interest rates on loans . Sorry , I just have a couple more questions . __eou__ I'm here to help . Tell me your questions and I'll do my best to answer them . __eou__ What if I require a loan for a short period of time ? __eou__ What repayment period were you thinking of ? __eou__ Say , 6 months ? Or less in fact . I want to repay the loan ASAP ; I don't like debt hanging over my head . __eou__ A wise decision . If you decide to take out a short-term loan with us , say for 6 months or less , the interest rate shall be for that of a 6 - month loan . __eou__ What if I repay it early . Any perks ? __eou__ Well , we could adjust the interest rate based on the original rate and the amount of days you actually borrowed the money for . __eou__ So , the quicker I pay it back , the more I can save in interest ? That's excellent . Thanks so much for your information . I'll come in shortly to take the relevant steps for the loan . __eou__ It's our pleasure . We are always happy to have another satisfied customer . Thanks for calling . Goodbye . __eou__
I think we should home school our children when we decide to have kids . __eou__ What ? Why ? __eou__ Well , our public schools here are not very good and private school are just too expensive . I have been reading up on home schooling and it has a lot of advantages . __eou__ Like what ? I think that by doing something like that we would be isolating our children from social interaction . __eou__ Well , first of all , I would be able to teach them everything they learn in school in a more relaxed and fun way . I also think that having a one-on-one class is much better since you can focus more on his or her strengths or weaknesses . __eou__ I think neither your parents or mine would agree to such an idea . __eou__ I will bring it up over Sunday brunch . __eou__ Good luck with that ! __eou__
Hello , Mr . Brown , long time no see . Where have you been ? __eou__ Oh , I went on a holiday in the city of Chende . __eou__ Great . What do you think of it ? __eou__ The city is small , not very modern , but there are many mountains with lots of trees around the city , so the air there is pretty fresh . __eou__ Did you go to the Summer Mountain Resort ? __eou__ Certainly ! The most attractive place is that , it's very large ; it is 8 times the size of Forbidden City and 16 times the size of Summer Palace . The art of gardens is perfectly represented in it . __eou__ It sounds great , and is it really cool there ? __eou__ Yes , I think the reason is that there is a big lake , and many trees in the Resort . __eou__ What is the special local product ? __eou__ The main product of Chende is various kinds of ferine mushroom and the almond . The mushroom tastes really good , and it is very different from the common mushrooms , and the snack made of almond is delicious . __eou__ I hope to go there someday . __eou__
I think we should do the floors before we work on the curtains and walls . __eou__ Why ? it doesn't make sense . If we do the floors first , and then paint the walls , we will get paint all over our new floor . __eou__ Hmm Maybe you're right . But I can't stand all this green carpet here . And besides , I know how to paint . I will just cover everything with drop cloth . I won't get anything on the floor . __eou__ Are you sure ? __eou__ Yes , I'm sure I've done a lot of house painting in my life . And my mother was very picky . If I got even a tiny drop of paint on her furniture , she would get furious . So I learned to be very careful . __eou__ Alright . Then maybe we can do the floor first . These wood floors under this carpet are beautiful . And me too — — I can't wait to get all this old carpet out of here . But how can we get it out ? Do we have to hire someone ? __eou__ Absolutely not . We can remove the carpet ourselves . Carpet is held down with carpet nails . You just need to pull it hard and it will come up . __eou__ Great . Then , after we remove the carpet , we need to redo all the wood floors . Right ? __eou__ Yes . But we should hire someone for that . That will probably be expensive . And it has to be done right . __eou__ And then , after the floors are done , we can start to move our furniture in . __eou__ Sure . If we can get an appointment with someone to do the floors , we should probably be able to have the furniture in here after a week or so . I can get all the carpet out this weekend . __eou__
Why do you want to eat western food so much today ? Anything special to celebrate ? Did you get a promotion ? __eou__ Honey , you really forgot about it ? Think it over . It's a candlelight dinner . __eou__ It's not your birthday , also not mine . Hey , come on . Just tell me . __eou__ It's our wedding anniversary , honey . How can you forget about it ? __eou__ My dear , tomorrow is our wedding anniversary . We've been together for 20 years . But you never change . Always so careless ! Do you remember the thing that happened on our wedding day ? __eou__ Of course . I almost missed my own wedding . __eou__ Yeah . Do you know that this restaurant used to be the teahouse where we first met ? __eou__ Oh , really ! It looks so different . Our old place turns into a brand new place . __eou__ Do you remember our first date ? I got a really special gift . __eou__ I can never forget that . I bought you five candies , but I was so anxious that I forgot to give them to you . You didn't get them until we parted . Then they had already melted down for I held them the whole time . __eou__ Yeah , it's really unforgettable . Thank you for making me happy all these years . __eou__ You are the one I should thank . You've done really great job . __eou__
Sam , I am so sorry . It was your birthday yesterday and I completely forgot about it . __eou__ Don't worry about it . I keep forgetting everyone's birthdays as well . __eou__ Margaret really told me off when she found out that I had forgotten all about it . We did try to phone you , but you and Jane must have gone out . __eou__ Yes , Jane invited me for dinner to this new restaurant which opened near us . __eou__ Oh , yes , I know the one . How was the food ? __eou__ The food was excellent , but Jane ordered a birthday cake , which they forgot about . So as you can see , you were not the only one . __eou__ Oh , no . __eou__ Yes , Jane was quite upset about it . The manager came to apologize and we did get free dessert , but still ... __eou__ I would think this was the least they could do . __eou__ In the end it was a nice evening and I got an iPad as my birthday present which I wanted for a while . __eou__ Great . I have also been thinking of getting one . Do you think you could ask Jane to have a quiet word with Margaret ? My birthday is not that far away . __eou__ I can try , but knowing Margaret she will see through that immediately . __eou__
This is a nice set of wheels . How much did the dealer charge you for this ? __eou__ A lot . I probably got to moonlight for the rest of my life , but so what , it ’ s worth it . Come on , get in . Let ’ s take a drive . __eou__ Okay then , let ’ s go fast ! Whoa ! This thing can really accelerate fast . __eou__ Check out what happens when I put on the brakes suddenly . It can stop quickly . __eou__ Hey , just watch out for cops or you ’ re gonna end up in the slammer . You know you tend to go fast ? __eou__ Yes , I know it . I went through my last set of tires fast . I even had three flat tires in two weeks . __eou__ Now watch ... some guys probably run a light and hit your car . __eou__ Cut out , would you ? __eou__
OK . Steven , you're looking at a picture . Please describe what you see ! __eou__ Uh , I can see a red double decker bus . It's the kind of bus you'll see very often in London . In fact I know this bus is from London because I can see the names , Chelsea , Sloan Square , Victoria , Herring Cross . These are all areas in London . Um , so obviously the bus is in London . __eou__ OK . Have you ever been on a double decker bus ? __eou__ Yeah , yeah , yeah . many times . Many times . When I was younger , you used to get double-decker all over England but now you only tend to see them in the big cities . __eou__ Oh , really . Mm ! How much is the fare ? __eou__ Well , it depends on the journey . It's .. I guess it's not too expensive , but the minimum price you would pay is , for a short journey , is about a pound . __eou__ Mm , yeah , who can you see on the bus ? Can you pick out anyone on the bus who looks interesting ? __eou__ Hmm , yeah , well this girl here at the back , that's leaning on the door , um , she looks really bored , actually . Maybe she is going to work or something and she doesn't want to go ! __eou__ Is that how you feel on the bus ? __eou__ Uh , well , no , not really , because I haven't worked in England for a long time , so I haven't taken a bus for a long time . __eou__ So , so you're British , do you missing them ? __eou__ Um , yes , sometimes . Sometimes . __eou__
Good morning.Are you Mr.Liu ? __eou__ My name is Liu Lichi . How do you do ? __eou__ How do you do ? Please be seated , How is your trip here ? __eou__ Quite good , I think . I came here by bus , and it took me about 15 minutes . __eou__ Oh , yes.How old are you ? __eou__ Twenty . __eou__ Hum , still a student ? __eou__ Yes , I'm student of grade 3 in the university majoring in economics . __eou__ What subjects are you studying ? __eou__ English , math , commercial and legal studies , and accountancy . __eou__ Have you had any working experience . __eou__ Well , I worked at a supermarket during last summer holidays . __eou__ What do you like to do in your spare time ? __eou__ I like sports very much.Besides that , I also like working on a computer in my spare time . __eou__ How are your English and computer skills ? __eou__ I have passed the CET - 4 and 6.As far as computer is concerned I can use the computer for word processing . __eou__ Okay . Mr.Liu , we'll inform you of the results within a week . __eou__
... Now , that's all I want to say about world coal reserves . So let's move on to the next topic , renewable resources . There are three things we have to consider when talking about renewable resources . First , sustainability ; second , marketability ; lastly , the reality factor . Let's talk about each point in more detail ... John , would you like to take it from here ? __eou__ Certainly . As my colleague just mentioned , sustainability is a major concern when examining the potential output of a resource . Of course , as you can see from the content of our presentation today , with renewable resource , there is a much larger sustainability than with non-renewable resource . __eou__
How large is the plant ? __eou__ It covers an area of 75,000 square meters . __eou__ It ’ s much larger than I expected . When was the plant set up ? __eou__ In the early 70s . We ’ ll soon be celebrating the 30th anniversary . __eou__ Congratulations ! __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ How many employees do you have in this plant ? __eou__ 500 . We ’ re running on three shifts . __eou__ Does the plant work with everything from the raw material to the finished product ? __eou__ Our associates specializing in these fields make some access - ries . Well , here we ’ re at the production shop . Shall we start with the assembly line ? __eou__ That ’ s fine . __eou__
is that your rabbit ? __eou__ yes , I just adopted her from the humane society this weekend . __eou__ that's good of you . why did you decide to get a rabbit . __eou__ well , i wanted to get a pet that wouldn't disturb the neighbors . at the same time , I wanted a pet that would be affectionate . __eou__ rabbits aren't usually that affectionate , are they ? __eou__ if you cuddle them a lot when they are very young , they can be just as affectionate as dogs or cats . __eou__ i didn't know that . Are rabbits difficult to take care of ? __eou__ not really . I went to the veterinarian to get her vaccinated and she told me that all I needed to do was to make sure to trim its nails from time to time , to give her food and water , and to clean its __eou__ that sounds pretty easy . Do rabbits make your house smell ? __eou__ No , rabbits aren't very stinky . As long as your clean the cage on a regular basis , it's not too bad . __eou__ can you train a rabbit to do things ? __eou__ you can't train them like you can train dogs , but you can train them to do some things . For example , you can train them to go the bathroom in a special rabbit toilet . __eou__ that's amazing ! Has she bitten you yet ? __eou__ not yet . She's pretty tame . I think she must be used to being around lots of different people . __eou__
Excuse me . Can you tell me how to find some books on social science ? __eou__ Sure . You see all these little drawers here and all the way around the walls ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ These drawers contain cards describing every book in our library . Together they constitute the library's " card catalog " . You can see that each drawer runs from one part of the alphabet to another . Fox example , this drawer goes from SCA to SCM . __eou__ So if I'm looking for a look called A History of Western Society , I'd just look under ' A ' . __eou__ No . You'd look under ' W ' . The articles ' a ' and ' the ' don't count in our alphabetization , and cards are generally omitted for extremely common words and phrases such as ' history of ' , ' introduction to ' , ' story of ' and so forth . __eou__ What if I don't know the title of the book ? __eou__ Well , you can look under the author's name . __eou__ Could you give me an example ? __eou__ Suppose you want to find a book by your professor , William Smith . You'd look under SMITH and then WILLIAM . Since that's very common name , you may have to go through several ' William Smith ' until you come to the one who wrote book on the subject you are interested in . __eou__
Do you eat a lot of healthy food ? __eou__ Compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . And anyway , I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . It's all in the mind . __eou__ You have the point . I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt . __eou__ What's special about these things ? __eou__ Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled . __eou__ Thanks . I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now . __eou__
do you like animals ? __eou__ yes , doesn't everyone ? __eou__ what's your favorite animal ? __eou__ it's hard to say . While dogs are more affectionate , cats are much easier to take care of . __eou__ have you ever had a dog ? __eou__ when I was little , we had a few domestic dogs at home . __eou__ they always say that dogs are a man's best friends . do you think that's true ? __eou__ definitely . rich or poor , dogs always love their masters . __eou__ how about cats ? Have you ever had one for a pet ? __eou__ i had one a few months ago , but she ended up running away . __eou__ how did that happen ? __eou__ she left through a window that was open one night and never returned . __eou__ you must have been devastated ! __eou__ i was pretty sad . i still hope that she'll return some day ! __eou__ I hope she does . Do you think you'll ever get another pet ? __eou__ I think I will . It's difficult to feel longly when you have a pet around . __eou__ i hope your cat finds its way back home . __eou__ i do , too . __eou__
How was your date recently ? __eou__ Not too bad . It is seemingly too hard for me to find a place for our date . __eou__ I guess so . Going to watch a movie and having dinner at a restaurant are usual . __eou__ She said she wanted to go Dutch in dating . __eou__ Yes , now many girls want to be independent , so it is a little popular , especially among white collars . __eou__ But I am still traditional , so I felt weird when she paid for herself . __eou__ Forget about it ! __eou__ Are you satisfied with your girlfriend ? __eou__ It will be a long story . We have many differences , for example , she usually puts all her clothes into washing machine . That is the sort of thing I can not bear . __eou__
How did you first meet Jack each other ? __eou__ That is a heavy raining afternoon . I was standing under the eaves of a shop to evade the heavy rain . It's getting dark . __eou__ And then ? __eou__ I was trembling in the wind when he ran to me with an umbrella in his hand and asked , ' Where is your home ? ' __eou__ Then he sent you to your home ? __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ It's a romantic meeting . I can say that a hero saves a beauty . __eou__ He joked later that I was so poor that he had a kind of impulse to protect an ant . __eou__ He is so humorous . __eou__
Hey , Gucci . I didn't know it would be a charity show . You can see there are many collecting boxes at the entrance . __eou__ Oh , I forgot to tell you this . The show is to collect money for children in need . And all the money from ticket selling will go to the Red Cross . __eou__ That's really a good thing . Let's do our part . __eou__ Good idea . __eou__ Who will sing in the show ? __eou__ A lot of stars , including Andy , Justin , Mendy ... __eou__ Mendy ? Are you sure ? I love her songs ! __eou__ Me too . She is so young and talented . She is not only a singer but also a great composer herself . __eou__ Yeah . Though she was so popular , I heard she managed to maintain a low profile . __eou__ She is a real star . Not a onetime thing . __eou__ But I also heard some people didn't like her music . I don't understand why . She is so amazing ! __eou__ Well , I suppose people have different tastes on music . Moreover , here stuff is really strong and creative . It takes time for people to accept new things . __eou__ You are right . Anyway , things will be different as the days go on . She can get it . I have faith in her . __eou__ Sure . That makes a good fan . Do you know what songs she is gonna sing tonight ? __eou__ Here is the programme . Check it out yourself ! __eou__ OK . __eou__
Hey . I'm a visitor from China . I love your music . It's the best I've ever heard . Will you please spare a little bit of time for me ? __eou__ Sure . Thank you for saying that . Actually , those songs were sung for the first time today . I wrote them in the past two months . __eou__ Oh , you wrote them all by yourself . That's amazing ! Are you a regular singer here ? __eou__ You can say that . But my band and I also sing regularly in several other places , too . __eou__ Cool . Your guitar skills are very impressive . How did you learn to play like that ? __eou__ I picked up guitar at an early age , maybe around 8 years old . Afterward , I taught myself by listening to some records of top players . __eou__ Wow , that's unbelievable ! You play so well , but you've never been to a real teacher . You will definitely be famous in the near future . __eou__

Your ticket is for Trans Pacific Flight 87 from Detroit to Beijing at 3 forty p . m . on April 13 . You will arrive at Beijing International Airport at six 35 p . m . on April 14 . Your electronic __eou__ What time should I arrive at Detroit Airport ? __eou__ Please be at the airport two hours before your departure to check in . You also need to reconfirm your reservation with the airline at least 7 days prior to your departure . __eou__ What happens if I can ’ t leave on April 13 ? Can I cancel my ticket or change the reservation to another date ? __eou__ Yes , you can , but you will have to pay a penalty of $ 75 for any change or cancellation . __eou__ That ’ s OK .

I can have two bags checked for 70 pounds each . I think I ’ m all set . You ’ re really efficient . Thank you very much for your help . __eou__ Thank you for the compliment and for calling G . O . T . Travel Agency . Have a nice trip ! __eou__
Come in and sit down . __eou__ Thanks , Mr . Liang . __eou__ Among all the assistants , I think you're on top of it . Based on the annual evaluation , the board of directors decided to give you a bonus . __eou__ Really ? I am too happy . __eou__ I've been reviewing your work over the past few months . Thanks to your excellent work , we benefit much from your project . And you should get the perfect attendance award too . __eou__ Thanks for your trust . Owing to my colleagues ' help , I've successfully completed my task . __eou__ You are very modest and diligent . The distribution of bonus derived from the performance evaluation . You deserve it . __eou__ Thank you very much . I will redouble my efforts in the future . __eou__
Strange looking handle on that coffee mug , isn't it ? __eou__ We submitted two designs to our buyers , this one and one with the mug indented to form a grip . They chose this one . __eou__ What's the advantage ? Price , I suppose . __eou__ No , this type cleans better , no crevices between the body and handle joint . __eou__ What deliveries are you quoting nowadays on orders such as ours ? __eou__ We can make shipment within one month from receipt of order . __eou__ You don't do much in porcelain tiles and ornaments , do you ? __eou__ We do a fair amount in tiles and in insulators for electrical appliances . But kitchenware and tableware are our mainlines . __eou__ I see . Well , keep up the good work . See you later . __eou__
How often are stockholders meetings held ? __eou__ Stockholders meetings are held biannually . Usually the meetings are scheduled for spring and fall . In between the meetings , each stockholder receives biannual reports . Financial statements are made once a year . __eou__ What percentage of the stockholders actually attend the meetings ? I'm guessing not a large percentage ... __eou__ You're right , it's a low percentage . Also , in order to attend meetings , you have to hold a certain amount of shares . It's quite a large number , so most of the stockers are excluded from proceedings . __eou__ So , how much say do the stockholders really have ? __eou__ Unless they're united , very little ... __eou__
Hey , Jenny . Would you like to go to dinner with me ? __eou__ I don't know . You know what they say about office romances . __eou__ No , I don't . What do they say about office romances ? __eou__ They say you shouldn't mix love and work . __eou__ That's silly . What I do on my own time is no one else ’ s business . Besides , it's pretty hard to meet people outside of the office when we spend long hours here . __eou__ You ’ Ve got a point . Once I dated one of my supervisors and all of my co-workers accused him of favoritism . Then when the relationship went bad , he fired me . __eou__ People fall in love with people they work with . That's a fact . __eou__ That may be true , but I don't want an inter-office relationship to affect my productivity . __eou__ If it does , it will only make you more productive , because we can support each other . __eou__ You are sounding like we are already married . __eou__ Good grief . All I did was ask you out . I am sorry . __eou__ Well , I don't feel right about it . __eou__ I am talking about dinner tonight , not a lifetime . __eou__ Most starts with dinner , but then it gets out of hand . Besides , haven't you asked out every woman in the entire office ? __eou__ I like company . __eou__ Company ? I heard about you from Linda . She said you were an octopus ! __eou__ What can I say ? I am a passionate guy . __eou__ Well , I hope you can find something else to be passionate about . __eou__ You want to go out with me and you know it . __eou__ In your dreams . Now if you don't mind , I've got some work to do . __eou__ Ok , I get the message . Hey , do you have any sisters ? __eou__
what sort of music do you like ? __eou__ I love just about anything by Prince . __eou__ so , you're into 80s music then ? __eou__ well , I like all kinds of music , but he is one of my favorites . How about you ? __eou__ I like alternative music . __eou__ do you have a favorite band ? __eou__ to be honest , no . I'm always in search of new music to listen to . __eou__ do you often go to concerts ? __eou__ I usually go to see a live band about twice a month . What about you ? __eou__ I love going to live gigs . Are there any good local bands playing around here that you'd recommend ? __eou__ there's an open mic night at the pub down the road every Thursday night where my favorite local band usually plays . You should come along next week with me . __eou__ I'd love to , but I have a night class on Thursdays . __eou__ that's too bad . Maybe another time . __eou__ let me know if you hear about any good bands playing on the weekends . I have more free time then . __eou__ I'll let you know . Did you want to watch some TV ? __eou__ sure , what's on ? __eou__ there's a reality TV show about a group of people who are trying to lose weight . __eou__ that sounds dreadful ! __eou__
Decent dressing and appearance , which contribute to a good first impression of the interviewer , are surely quite important . __eou__ Of course . Generally speaking , dressing should be tidy and neat , and match well with your identity , age , and experience . __eou__ Whatever you wear , it should perfectly reflect your confidence and vitality __eou__ Professional suits may be the best choice . __eou__ Gentlemen should wear western-style suits in the interview , which will help you look handsome . __eou__ Ladies should wear professional suits , either classical style or free style . It would be appropriate to wear a little or no make-up . __eou__ But those fashionable and shiny clothes should be avoided . __eou__ Name brand is not necessary . Anything decent will be fine . __eou__ You should present the best of yourself in order to achieve success in the interview . __eou__ Only when you dressing keep in accordance with that of other people around can you feel harmonious and relaxed . __eou__ In a word , dressing and appearance are indeed important , but it should never be all . __eou__ In other words , too much emphasis on it is undoubtedly to neglect the essentials . __eou__
Do you have any particular hobbies , Tom ? __eou__ Oh , yes . I love playing badminton , table tennis and computer games . And playing the games has become my favorite . __eou__ I hear many teenagers will spend hours and hours sitting at computers . And they don't care about their own health at all . How about you ? __eou__ I'm no better than them . They say it's mindless to sit in front of a machine all the time , but I think it's stimulating . __eou__ You won't play online games full of violence , will you ? __eou__ Once in a while . __eou__ It's no good . And I think spending several hours each day playing computer games is a waste of time . You might as well do something healthy and meaningful . __eou__ I hope I can practice self-control again . __eou__
The company is selecting three employees to attend the marketing seminar next month . Did you put your name in for it ? __eou__ No , I don't really care too much for seminars ... I find them to be either boring ot useless . I mean , how much can you really learn in one afternoon ? __eou__ It's not just about the things that you learn , you know ... seminars are a really great opportunity to mingle and network with professionals in our industry from all over the nation . You can learn a few things , but more importantly , you rub shoulders with the business leaders and make contacts that could lead to potential sales or partnerships in the future . The social mixers are always more important than the seminars anyway . __eou__ I'm still not too jazzed about going ... I feel kind of awkward in those cocktail party situations . __eou__ Well , what if I told you the seminar is going to be held in Hawaii ? Does that perk your interest ? __eou__ Now you're talking . __eou__
You wouldn't believe what I got in the mail today ! __eou__ what's that ? __eou__ it's a letter from Ray and Sue in Shanghai ! __eou__ have you read it yet ? __eou__ no , I thought I'd wait until you got home . __eou__ go on , read it out loud . __eou__ ok . It says , " Dear Jessica . It was so good to receive you letter . I sounds like you and Riley are settling into your new home with ease ... " __eou__ when did you send her a letter ? __eou__ just a few weeks ago . Sue and I send letters to each other often . __eou__ I didn't know anyone did that any more . Ok , go on . __eou__ ok ... I'm going to have to skip over this section . It's girl-talk . __eou__ that's fine with me . __eou__ oh . It's actually all rather personal . __eou__ well , skip over all of that and read me the rest . __eou__ ok , it just says , ball , blah , blah ... " Ray and I look forward to seeing you in June . Write soon . With love , Sue . " __eou__ are we going to see them in June or are they coming to see us ? __eou__ didn't I tell you ? We're going to Shanghai to stay with them in June . __eou__ oh , I guess I missed that . __eou__ men ! __eou__
You are going to work as my office secretary from next Monday . Right now I want to show you the rules of our company . __eou__ Thank you for your instruction . I really need to know the rules before I play the game , so I can know more about our company . __eou__ The working hours are from 9:00 to 11:30 in the morning and from 1:30 to 5:30 in the afternoon . Make sure never to be late or absent . Every time you should use the employee card to show you are present whenever you come into the company . __eou__ Set your heart at rest . I keep this in my mind . __eou__ In my opinion , a secretary must be familiar with office routine and try to do some things by you . This is the filing cabinet and any document or file you may need . And you should file these documents in alphabetical order . __eou__
Hi , I am so glad to see you . __eou__ Are you kidding me ? Why do you say so ? __eou__ You know , I'm about to graduate and I have to look for a job as soon as possible . But I haven ’ t the faintest idea of how to go about finding a job . __eou__ OK . Let me see where to start . __eou__ I guess first I should prepare a resume , right ? __eou__ Sure . You should include your name , address and phone number in your resume . __eou__ Then what else should I put into my resume ? __eou__ Your job objectives , of course . In other words , what kind of job are you searching for ? __eou__ I got it . Then I should mention my educating background and working experience , should I ? __eou__ Yes . And don't forget to list them by date . Besides , you should begin with the most recent and then move backward . __eou__ I see . Is that all there is to it ? __eou__ No , it's also necessary to list a few related interests that are in some way connected to the jobs you want to take . __eou__ Oh , good point . You mean here I should show off my special skills and talents to impress the boss . __eou__ You said it . At last you ’ d better attach a list of references to your resume . __eou__ That's easy . __eou__ And one more thing , smile widely . __eou__
Grand Theft Auto Three is awesome ! __eou__ It's more violent than TV news ! __eou__ What time is it anyway ? __eou__ Nine-thirty . __eou__ Oh , my God , three hours already ! I have to get the chores done ! __eou__ No time . That's their headlights in the window ! __eou__ OK , emergency measures . Let's throw the dishes in the trash ! Two birds with one stone ... __eou__ Little dude , your life is over ! __eou__ No time to worry . We have to dispose of this evidence . __eou__
He has come to life in the end . __eou__ Oh , thank God . We all felt frightened by the bad new about him . __eou__ Yes . Fortunately , an ambulance passed in the nick of time , and we got him away to hospital . __eou__ Right . Unless , who know what will happen . __eou__ Wish him to be healthy soon . __eou__
Wanna chill out and watch cable ? __eou__ Wow ! Besides The Cosby Show , I've never seen a black sitcom . What's this program ? __eou__ It's a drama called Soul Food . This channel is BET-Black Entertainment Television . It has black shows , news and commercials . __eou__ This show is like a black Friends . __eou__ BET has black shows that are overlooked by mainstream white TV . __eou__ That's cool . I've heard LA has an all-Asian channel on cable . __eou__
How do you do ? Nice to meet you , Diane . __eou__ How do you do , Jack . Nice to meet you . __eou__ Well , I think you ' Ve reconsidered our proposal , Diane . __eou__ Yes , you are right . After all , the quality of your air conditioners is good . The only problem is price . __eou__ I should not be surprised , many customers have the same opinion . Do you have any suggestion in mind ? Our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable . __eou__ That's why I came to your office today . We think for your model WE - 506 $ 590 would be reasonable , because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579-649 . __eou__ That's true . But if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product , you'll agree that 679 is not high , especially when we allow you a 10 % discount . __eou__ I see your point . That's to say s 611 each set . Still it's much higher than the market price . Could you see your way to reduce the price , Jack ? __eou__ Well , considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to 600 . That's the best we can do . What do you think of that ? __eou__ All right . We accept it . So $ 600 for each set . __eou__ Very well . Thank you . __eou__
Joy Chain elementary school , please . __eou__ Will do . __eou__ How frustrating ! The bus is still not coming . __eou__ Ma'am , take your kid to school ? __eou__ Yes . I am in a hurry . Please take a shortcut . __eou__ No problem . Don't worry , the taxi is faster than the bus . __eou__ The traffic is terrible on Monday morning . It takes us almost 1 hour to get to school . __eou__ My son is the same . But he always makes an early start in the morning , and enjoys listening to the English programmer Let's talk in English on the way . __eou__ That's wonderful . He is killing two birds with one stone.Sir , please turn right at the next corner . And stop at the taxi stand . __eou__ OK ! __eou__ What is the fare ? __eou__ It's 14.5 Yuan . __eou__ Keep the change ! __eou__ Thanks , Ma'am . __eou__
What's for dinner ? __eou__ Leftovers . __eou__ What ? Leftovers of what and from when ? __eou__ From last night ! I took the left over turkey , mixed it with some diced peppers and onions , added a little bit of mayonnaise and made some sandwiches ! __eou__ Isn't that dangerous though ? I mean bacteria and germs reproducing on food that was left out or re-heated ? __eou__ Well , I didn't leave the turkey out at room temperature for more than a an hour and I refrigerated it soon after we finished eating . Also , when reheating , I put it in the oven for fifteen minutes at one hundred degrees Celsius . __eou__ Well OK , I am just afraid of getting food poisoning . __eou__ Don't worry about it ! Making a new meal out of leftovers is almost an art ! Not only do you save money , but you also get to be creative and have something different to eat ! __eou__
Hi , Daniel , how are you holding up ? I am greatly sorry for your loss . __eou__ Thank you , I ’ m doing much better . I ’ Ve begun organizing everything for the funeral . __eou__ How ’ s that going ? __eou__ It ’ s a lot harder than I imagined . There are many things that you have to to arrange . I booked a time and date with the funeral home , but I still have a lot of things to do . __eou__ Have you bought a burial plot and a casket ? __eou__ No . Wendy is being cremated . She always talked about how she didn ’ t want to be buried . I already chose a cremation urn and we plan to spread the ashes in the ocean . __eou__ I see , that sounds like something she would have really liked . I am sure the memorial service will be tasteful . You are doing a great job . __eou__ Thanks , it hasn ’ t been easy , but luckily we have life insurance and Wendy left behind a detailed will that will sort out any other legal matters . __eou__
So , you ’ re applying for a B2 visa , where is your final destination and what ’ s the purpose of your trip to the United States ? __eou__ I ’ m going to visit my brother . he ’ s just had a baby . He lives in Minneapolis . __eou__ And how long do you you plan to remain in the United States ? __eou__ I ’ ll be here for approximately three weeks . See , here ’ s my return ticket for the twenty-sixth of March . __eou__ And , who is sponsoring your trip ? __eou__ My brother , here , this is an invitation letter from him . I will stay with him and his family in their home . __eou__ Alright , tell me about the ties you have to your home country . __eou__ Well , I own a house . actually , I ’ m leaving my dog there with my neighbors . I have a car at home , and oh , my job ! I ’ m employed by Tornal as an engineer . Actually , I only have three weeks ’ vacation , so I have to go back to work at the end of March . __eou__ And what evidence do you have that you are financially independent ? __eou__ Well , I do have assets in my country . like I said , I own a house , and see , here ’ s a bank statement showing my investments , and my bank balance . __eou__ I ’ m sorry , sir , we cannot grant you a B2 visa at this time , instead , you are granted a resident visa ! Congratulations , you are the millionth person to apply for a visa ! You win ! Congratulations ! __eou__
What happened to that girl you were seeing ? __eou__ Oh Jackie ? We broke up last week . __eou__ That was a short relationship . You only started dating 2 months ago . __eou__ It was actually a long two months . She was a psycho . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ She would be laughing one moment , and if I said something insensitive , she would start crying . I didn't want to deal with that . __eou__ She sounds very emotional . __eou__ She was a psycho , man . One time we were suppose to get together . I was waiting for her call , and when she finally called , she was screaming why I wasn't at her place . __eou__ Were you suppose to be there ? __eou__ I thought she was going to call when she was done shopping . It was a misunderstanding . She was literally screaming on the phone over this . __eou__ Ok . You're right . She's a psycho . __eou__ I'm just glad it's over . __eou__
Julia , what do you think of the network ? __eou__ Network is omnipresent nowadays . It's quite convenient for people . You see , we can download music and information from the Internet ; I can study from it , too . And the most of all , we can compose , send , and receive e-mails . __eou__ Yeah , you are right . Internet makes our lives easier . But it's a two-blade sword . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I mean Internet brings benefit a lot , but also some disadvantages . For example , many youngsters are addicted to the games and they neglect their study ; or some bad guys steal people's money online , etc . __eou__ I agree . But I think although it has some negative effects , on the whole Internet does more good to us than harm . __eou__ Yeah , you are right . But we have to know how to make good use of it . __eou__
Hi , Janice . Our first weekend after being employed is coming . Show me your plan . __eou__ My mom phoned me this morning , and asked me to go back home to have housework chores . __eou__ What are you assigned to do ? __eou__ God knows . Speaking of chores , I would rather do some washing than cooking . __eou__ For me , I think I will iron my shirt and trousers . Actually , weekends tend to be the most hectic day in the whole week . __eou__ I really hope that I could sleep like a log all through two nights . But ... Some one said that weekends are a bit like rainbows ; they look good from a distance but disappear before we get up close to them . __eou__ I couldn't agree more . __eou__
I am very interested in a new apartment near the Taxing Plaza , but the price is very high , I really can't afford it . __eou__ How much is it for each square meter ? How large is the apartment ? __eou__ It's 7500 yuan per square meter , and I really like the one with three bedrooms and a large living room . Its total area is about 80 square meters . __eou__ That surely will cost you a lot of money . Are you going to make a full payment ? __eou__ Do you think I am rich enough to make it ? I am thinking about buying the apartment by installments . The real estate agency says if I pay a 25 % down payment , I can move in at once . __eou__ If sounds so tempting . Why not go applying for a loan from the bank ? They charge very low interest , so you can choose whether to pay up the balance in 10 or 20 years . __eou__
Even with volume sales our costs for the Exec User won't go down much . __eou__ Just what are you proposing ? __eou__ We could take a cut on the price . But 25 % would reduce much our profit margin . We suggest a compromise 10 % . __eou__ That's a big change from 25 % ! 10 % is beyond my negotiating limit . Any other ideas ? __eou__ I don't think I can change it right now . Why don't we talk again tomorrow ? __eou__ Sure . I have to talk to my office anyway . I hope we can find some common ground on this . __eou__ Robert , I have been instructed to reject the numbers you proposed , but we can try to come up with something else . __eou__ I hope so , Dana . My instructions are to negotiate hard on this deal , but I'm trying very hard to reach some middle ground . __eou__ I understand . We propose a structured deal . For the first six months , we get a discount of 20 % and the next six months we get 15 % . __eou__ Dana . I can't bring those numbers back to my office , they'll turn it down flat . __eou__ Then you'll have to think of something better , Robert . __eou__
How do you think a manager should react to an employee ’ s unsatisfactory work ? __eou__ If I were a manager , I would have a private talk with this employ to figure out the reasons . It is very important to have this one-to-one discussion in an unthreatening situation without any distraction . __eou__ Exactly , I overheard a manager scold his employee in the elevator this morning , they were from the company on the 12th floor , I guess . They were only three of us in the elevator , I felt very embarrassed to be in the middle of them . __eou__ Well , I guess the employee would feel more embarrassed and probably angry . Anyway , it is not wise at all to give a harsh time to your employee in front of others , especially strangers . __eou__ Sure , no matter what happened , they should wait to discuss in their office and find the solution in a positive way . __eou__
Give these sales figures a look . It's pretty depressing . We're way in the red this year . We can't afford to keep going like this for much longer . __eou__ You're right , we need to start making money soon , or at least manage to break even . But I think that the market is slowly beginning to heat up--sales are bound to pick up any time now . __eou__ Deman is dropping . The problem is our competition . They are monopolizing the market ! __eou__ Maybe we should rethink our marketing strategy to include the possibility that our new line of cosmetics could be a big seller . __eou__ It's really too early to tell , but a lot is riding on the new products . If we don't do better after the product launch , we may have to go bankrupt . __eou__ Do you think it's that serious ? __eou__ Look at this numbers and see for yourself . Read'sm and weep . __eou__ My goodness , I didn't realize it was that bad . __eou__
Some people pile on their agonise and try to seek other ’ s sympathy by telling them how miserable they are . __eou__ Yeah . They take the advantage of other people's hospitality and generosity . __eou__ I was fooled once . A lady told me she needed some money to keep the pot boiling . So I gave her some money and bailed her out of the situation . But later I learned that she had lied to me . __eou__ You are still wet behind the ears . You should have seen through her . __eou__ Nothing rang a bell . __eou__
What are the factors that have great impact on the perspective of this corporation ? __eou__ External factors . I think the main external factors are political , economic , social and technological factors . __eou__ What are the internal factors that influence the company ? __eou__ The internal factors are composed of human resources , team spirit , innovation spirit and coordination between different departments , etc . __eou__
Whew ! I had to wait for almost an hour to get to the front of the line . __eou__ You have much patience . __eou__ Wow ! Your calligraphy is very beautiful . It was worth the wait ! __eou__ Thank you . Today I'm writing a kind of poem called a Chinese couplet . __eou__ What does it say ? __eou__ This is an especially famous one . It says " May the passing days bring you health and longevity . May this season of renewal find you basked in riches . " __eou__ That's very nice . Is it for sale ? __eou__ No . I never sell my artwork . __eou__ Really ? Then what do you do with it ? __eou__ I give it away . Here , this one is for you . __eou__ Wow ! Really ? Are you sure ? Now I'll have a lucky year ! __eou__ Remember , real luck must be created ( by ) yourself , and then it cannot be given or taken away ... __eou__
I am a student in Cambridge University . I read your ad , I want to know something more about your room , please ? __eou__ It's a big bedroom with a drawing room , facing a beautiful wood . __eou__ Is there a bathroom ? __eou__ No , but there is one downstairs , which my daughter used some years ago . __eou__ It sounds good . Could I go and see it myself ? __eou__ Certainly , you're welcome anytime . __eou__ See you later ! __eou__ ( after a while ) Good afternoon , Mrs . Smith . I called you just now . __eou__ Welcome ! Come in , please ! __eou__ Yes . __eou__ This way please . Your room is upstairs ... Here it is . __eou__ Wonderful ! A modest , comfortable room .

When can I move in ? __eou__ Anytime you like . __eou__ OK . __eou__
Hi , Bill . Are you going to the commencement ? __eou__ Yes . Do you want to go with me ? __eou__ OK . ( Several minutes later . ) Let's go into the school auditorium . __eou__ Now that take this seat . Do you see those piles of red diplomas on the desks on the stage ? __eou__ Yes . I find my heart is now rising and falling like waves , all sorts of feelings welling up in my heart . __eou__ That's true . Four years ' trails and hardships , joys and sorrows of life are gushing out to my mind all together . I can hardly tell whether I am joyful or gloomy at the moment when I am about to leave the campus and to start a new stage of my life . __eou__ How time flies . Look , the president of the college has come onto the stage . __eou__ He's going to make the opening speech . __eou__
Hello , Mr.Benson , welcome to Beijing ! Is this your first time to visit china ? __eou__ Oh , no , I'v already made several trips to Guangzhou , this is my first trip to Beijing though.It is a lot larger than I expected it would be . __eou__ Yes , Beijing has been grown over the last few years , there are a lot of improvements and changes being made for the Olympics . What would you like to see changing be made for Olympic , what would you like to see when are you here ? __eou__ I hope to have time to visit great wall when I am here , I always want to go there , I think it would be a real shame by came all the way in Beijing and didn't make out the wall , do you think I have a chance to see it ? __eou__ I can pretty sure it can be arranged , the wall is a short distance from the city , but we could make arrangements for driver to take us out to visit the great wall during when our afternoon breaks , I also recommend you to visit Tian'an Men Square and city while you add it ! __eou__ Yes , that would be nice , would I have a tour guide to tour completely visit these places ? __eou__ Don't worry , I would be able to go along with you , over the next few days , if you have any questions or problems , I will be right here to help you out , I can be a translator and tour guide . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ My pleasure , I hope your visit to Beijing is very enjoyable ! __eou__
Mrs . Wang , would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable ? __eou__ As I said before , your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid . We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap . __eou__ Just to comply , we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent . I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling . __eou__ So do we . Certainly it's a step forward on your side . But the gap is still too wide . __eou__ The ball is in your court , Mrs.Wang . What price would you suggest ? __eou__ To make your offer workable , I think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken . __eou__ That won't do . You see , our profit margin is very narrow . It simply can't stand such a big cut . __eou__ I hate to disappoint you , Mr . Brown , but if that's the case , we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere . Do think it over , please . We sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion . __eou__ Well , I'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction . Would you mind waiting a day or two , until I get a reply from the home office ? __eou__ Not at all . Shall we meet again , say , on Friday morning ? __eou__ Good . Friday morning at 9 . __eou__
Do you remember what the ratings of movies stand for ? __eou__ Yes , G stands for General Audiences , PG means Parental Guidance suggested , R is restricted to audiences under 18 and X means explicit content . __eou__ Does anyone pay any attention to those ratings anymore ? __eou__ Remember when we were kids ? Theaters wouldn't let kids in to PG moves without a parent . __eou__ I remember that I never saw an X moves even displayed . __eou__ Now with video rentals it's all a personal matter . __eou__ Yea , I never see theaters turn people away for their age anymore either . __eou__ Now we have to make a choice about what we will see and what we won't . __eou__
There are thousands of magazines published in the world to meet the needs of different readers . But only a few of them are influential world-wide . __eou__ You have hit the point . It's really hard for a magazine to be well known to people of various ages and educational backgrounds . __eou__ But I think Digest is supposed to be the top one . Its subscribers or buyers are from all social classes , perhaps , a majority of them from the educated group . It's quite strange that the readers love it after reading it . __eou__ To my mind , the success of Digest is in the clever selection of its articles in each issue . __eou__
Did you move into your new apartment ? __eou__ Yes , but I ’ m afraid it ’ s still a mess . I haven ’ t put anything away yet . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . It ’ ll probably take you about three weeks to get everything organized . __eou__ Don ’ t say that . It looks like a dump now . I can ’ t stand it . __eou__ Have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet ? __eou__ Unfortunately , yes . __eou__ What do you mean by that ? __eou__ I took a long walk through the neighborhood this morning on my way to the train station . It took me 20 minutes . __eou__ Yes , but you only pay 800 dollars a month . Emm , it ’ s hard to decide which is better , shorter commuting time or lower rent . __eou__ I thought paying a lower rent would be better , but now I ’ m not sure . __eou__ Is there a supermarket nearby ? __eou__ Yes , if you consider 7-11 is a supermarket . __eou__ Sounds like you better buy a bicycle . __eou__ That ’ s right , or I ’ m going to spend a lot of time walking . __eou__
Here's some dancing . See those guys stomping , clapping and shouting ? They're practicing step-dancing . __eou__ It sounds cool . The rhythms look really difficult . __eou__ They basically turn their bodies into drums . There's a national step competition every year . __eou__ Well , black people are supposed to be great dancers . __eou__ Wen ! That's only a stereotype . Like all Asians are supposed to be math geniuses . I'm not a great dancer , and you said you failed calculus . __eou__ Ha-ha ! You got me there ! __eou__
Good afternoon , how can I help you ? __eou__ Someone has stolen my gold necklace . __eou__ I am sorry to hear about that . Would you mind coming with me to my office and tell me exactly what happened here ? __eou__ Of course not . __eou__ Are you sure that it isn't somewhere in your room ? __eou__ Yes , I've looked everywhere in my room and I can ’ t find it . __eou__ Ok , when and where did you last see it ? __eou__ Last night on the dresser . I took it off before I went to the shower , and forgot to put it back on after the shower . And this morning I left the hotel in a hurry without wearing it . __eou__ Are you sure you didn't wear it this morning ? __eou__ Yes , I am positive . __eou__ Did you remember to lock your door before you left then ? __eou__ Yes , I think I did . It has to be one of your maids who took it . I want my necklace back . __eou__ Well , I understand how you feel , and we will try to do our best to help you . But first please allow me to send one of the housemaids to your room to look for it again thoroughly , just in case it's still in there . If she finds it , we will all be happy . If she doesn't , we will turn the whole matter to the police . But I must say that the hotel can't be held responsible for your loss . You should have locked your gold necklace away at the hotel ’ s safety box . If you had read your key card carefully , you would have realized that we specially warned you to do so . __eou__ That just isn't good enough . Cet me your general manager . I want to speak to him now . __eou__ I am sorry , ma ’ am . Our general manager is not in town . But I ’ d be more than glad to get you our assistant manager , if you like . But I am afraid that he will say the same thing . We have very clear instructions about valuables and we must follow them . And now if you will excuse me , I'll go and find our assistant manager for you . __eou__
I see myself as being honest , diligent , persevering and creative . And I have a strong sense of responsibility . __eou__ How about your psychological resilience ? __eou__ I think I can work well under pressure , if necessary . __eou__ How would you deal with those who are not easy to get along with ? __eou__ I will just be sincere and friendly to others , and I believe they will treat me the same way . __eou__ You seem to be a kind-hearted lady . __eou__ Thank you . I simply believe the goodness of human nature . __eou__ Please tell me your weaknesses if you can . __eou__ I should admit that sometimes I care too much about the details . I am always in pursuit of perfection . __eou__
Your dog is so much fun . He ’ s so playful . I wish our cat enjoyed being around people as much as your dog does . __eou__ Cats are well know for being more independent than dogs . How old is your cat now ? you ’ Ve had her longer than we ’ Ve had our dog . __eou__ She ’ s eight years old . She ’ s getting quite old . Your dog ’ s six , isn ’ t he ? __eou__ Yes . He ’ s so energetic . We take him out to the park every morning and evening . I think he ’ d be happy to stay there all day ! __eou__ I ’ m sure he would . We usually have to drag him home . __eou__ Your cat spends most of the day outdoors ' , right ? Do you kino where she goes ? __eou__ She spends less time outdoors and she used to . we have no idea where she goes . She ’ s very secretive . Occasionally , she brings back a dead mouse . __eou__ Have you ever thought about having another pet ? __eou__ The kids want a rabbit . I don ’ t think it would be a good idea to get a mouse or a fish ! That might be too tempting for our cat ! __eou__
Some people are always closing their handsets , so it's difficult to inform them . __eou__ Why not send them short messages ? __eou__ Can short messages reach them ? __eou__ Short messages will be kept in the short messages center . Once they open the handsets they will receive them , which is better than you can't find them . __eou__ Why haven't I thought of this skill ? __eou__ I use short messages quite a lot . If it's not too complicated I will send a short message , which can save much phone charge . __eou__ I am informed that many people used short messages to pay a New Year call , and only on the Spring Festival it amounted to 1 billion this year , didn't it ? __eou__ I almost can't live without messages , from which I learn about weather forecasts and stock quotations . __eou__
Hello , is it necessary to do warm-up exercise ? I can't wait to dive into the water . __eou__ I'm sorry . Every customer coming here must do the warm-up exercise before getting down to swimming . That's out regulation . __eou__ Yeah , I see . You are just doing your job . But I wanna know what the advantages it has . __eou__ OK , lovely boy . Try to be patient . Do you know the danger of swimming without warm-up ? __eou__ As far as I know , people will be weak if they swim too long . __eou__ That's right . But the most dangerous thing is that their legs may spasm out of control when swimming . __eou__ Is it very dangerous ? I'm a little scared . Do you offer the lifebuoy for us ? __eou__ Yes , besides that , we also provide our customers with goggles , swimming suit and something like that . __eou__ Do you have the workers to save me if anything should happen ? __eou__ Of course , all the workers here are able to swim , and they will come to your aid quickly . __eou__
Where do you think we should go on holiday this summer ? __eou__ We , I ’ d like to go to Australia . I know it ’ s far to go , but I think it would be something different and special . __eou__ I ’ d really like to go to the Caribbean . We can relax on the beached and enjoy the sunshine . __eou__ There are beaches in Australia too , but I would prefer a more active holiday this year . We could visit Ayers rock and the great barrier reef . It would be so exciting . __eou__ But would it be relaxing ? By summer . I ’ ll be quite tired from doing so much work . The last thing I need is to use more energy racing around Australia . I ’ d need another holiday to recover from the holiday ! __eou__ Oh , come on ! A tour of Australia would be relaxing because you ’ d be doing something different and not working . __eou__ Do you think so ? I ’ m not so sure . Anyway , tell me your plans for an Australian holiday . How long do you think we should spend there ? __eou__ I think we should go for two weeks . We could spend a week in the bush and a week at the great barrier reef-including a few day on the beach for tired office workers ! __eou__ That doesn ’ t sound too bad . I ’ d certainly like to go diving . That ’ s one reason I wanted to go to the Caribbean . __eou__ We could hire a car and travel around the interior of Australia for several days . If we hire a car , we can go where we like . __eou__ We ’ d have to plan our drive before we leave . Let ’ s get a good guidebook from the bookstore when we go shopping in town tomorrow . __eou__ It looks like I might have convinced you to go to Australia ! __eou__
Has your company been affected much by government legislation ? __eou__ Yes , we have . We've had to clean up our production process a lot to meet tough government standards . __eou__ What about your use of raw materials ? __eou__ Well , we've had to cut down the amount of solvents we use and we ’ re not allowed to use lead in our products any more . __eou__ What happens if you exceed the limits ? __eou__ We try not to because you might have to pay quite a heavy fine . __eou__
Hello . __eou__ Good morning , Ruth . Did I wake you up ? __eou__ No , I was just about to get up . What's up , Carl ? __eou__ Listen , I am calling to confirm what you said yesterday . Are we supposed to meet at the Chinatown terminal of the Avenue B bus or D bus ? __eou__ B as in boy . You should get off at the last stop in Chinatown . __eou__ Oh , you mean Canal Street ? __eou__ That's the wrong direction . Canal Street is on the other side of Chinatown . __eou__ Oh , I get it . When did we decide to meet ? __eou__ At 10,45 . Is Ann coming along ? __eou__ I cannot get hold of her yet . __eou__ See you around , Carl . __eou__ See you later . __eou__
Have you read all these crazy things that are going on around the world ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed ! Then they are sold on the black market . __eou__ Don't tell me you actually believe all that ? Don't be so gullible , they are just urban legends . They are just stories people make up to scare you . __eou__ Well , I was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you play them backwards ! Can you believe that ? __eou__ You really think an artist or song writer is going to go through the trouble of putting subliminal or satanic messages in a song ? Don't be so naive ! __eou__ Well maybe you are right , but how about the story of how KFC has rows of headless chickens which are super grown in order to get bigger chickens faster ! __eou__ Sounds a bit too far fetched to be true , don't you think ? __eou__
Do you have the day off today ? How come you're not at work now ? __eou__ I don't have the day off . Our labor union is staging a nationwide strike today , all of the workers in our department are supporting the labor union by participating and not going in to work this week . __eou__ Are you serious ? Why would they have to go to such extreme measures like a strike ? Doesn't your company have a pretty good corporate image ? I'll bet the folks at headquarters are going nuts over something as serious as a strike ... __eou__ It happens quite often , actually.Whenever there arises a dispute between the union and the executive group , the first thing they do is to call a strike . Usually it only lasts a day or two before both sides can come to an agreement and we start work again . Anyhow , it's a nice , unanticipated holiday ... __eou__
what do you think about the public service advertisement for quiting smoking ? __eou__ while I think it's great that they're trying to get people to quit smoking , but I don't really care for the advertisement . __eou__ why not ? __eou__ the fish hook that they use is quite disturbing ! __eou__ it's a pun . They use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking . __eou__ I know , but I think it's not really appropriate for young children . __eou__ I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking . __eou__ all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty . __eou__ perhaps you're right , , though . Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow . __eou__ I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them . __eou__ that's a good point . I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad . __eou__ you have to give them credit , though . It's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking . __eou__
Excuse me , sir , may I talk to you ? __eou__ Bill ! Sure , come on in . What can I do for you ? __eou__ Well sir , as you know , I have been an employee of this prestigious firm for over ten years . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I won ’ t beat around the bush . Sir , I would like a raise . I currently have three companies after me and so I decided to talk to you first . __eou__ A raise ? Son , I would love to give you a raise , but this is just not the right time . __eou__ I understand your position , and I know that the current economic downturn has had a negative impact on sales , but you must also take into consideration my hard work , pro-activeness and loyalty to this company for over a decade . __eou__ Taking into account these factors , and considering I don ’ t want to start a brain drain , I ’ m willing to offer you a ten percent raise and an extra five days of vacation time . How does that sound ? __eou__ Great ! It ’ s a deal ! Thank you , sir ! __eou__ Before you go , just out of curiosity , what companies were after you ? __eou__ Oh , the electric company , gas company and water company ! __eou__
Margaret , I'd like to follow up with the arrangements for our company retreat , to take place next month . We need to book the venue , make arrangements for speakers and door prizes , and set up all the activities and accommodations . Also , very important , we need to determine which of our staff will be eligible and will be available to go . We've got to get a head count in order to make reservations . __eou__ What's the criteria for staff to attend ? Are we only including our management team in this affair ? Or will we be extending invitations to lower level employees to attend ? __eou__ Lower level employees need not attend . The purpose of this retreat is for training , especially for our management team . We want to develop a well-oiled machine on our executive level . In order to get everyone to jell together , we've got to include some fun . That's the reason for the retreat . __eou__
Hello , Matt ! __eou__ Hello , Todd ! __eou__ Matt , I'm going to ask you some questions about pet.First question , do you have a pet ? __eou__ Yes , in fact , my mom's house we have three , three pets . two dogs and a cat . My family actually raises dogs for helping blind people . __eou__ Wow , like how do they train the dogs ? __eou__ How do they train the dogs ? Well , I mean , it's a long process , right ... we get them when they're puppies ... and so we train them basic ... you know , sit , come ... really basic things ... then , after they're about two year old , they go a different training school . __eou__ Well , how many dogs do they train at a time ? __eou__ Oh , just one ! We have our own dog , and then we have a dog that we have that we are training . __eou__ Do you ever see the dogs you trained , like out on the street , or anything ? __eou__ Sometimes we'll see them , they'll have like sort of conventions of reunions of the pets so , yeah , you get to see them once in awhile . __eou__ Oh , wow , that's cool . Um , why do people keep pets ? __eou__ I guess the most important thing is companionship , right ! So there is always somebody there for you that will like you no matter what . __eou__ Yeah , that's true . OK , besides cats , dogs , and fish , what are some other pets people keep ? __eou__ Well , I guess if you are Sigrid and Roy you can keep a tiger or lion . I guess all types of things don't they . __eou__
Did you get your grades yet ? __eou__ Yeah . My whole GPA is screwed up now . __eou__ Why ? What happened ? __eou__ Well , I bombed my econ final and ended up with a 1.7 . __eou__ Ouch . You must be very disappointed . __eou__ Well , it's my fault because I didn't study as much as I should have . __eou__ Why don't you re-take the class next year ? __eou__ That's what I plan on doing unless I keep screwing up . How did you do this semester ? __eou__ I didn't do that well either . I ended up with a 3.2 this semester . That drops my total GPA to 3.45 . __eou__ My GPA is pretty similar to yours . I have a 3.1 now because of the stupid econ class . __eou__ What was your GPA before this semester ? __eou__ I was sitting happy with a 3.4 . __eou__ Why did it go down so much ? __eou__ Let's just say I screwed up more than my econ class . __eou__ What happened to you ? __eou__ I started playing starcraft and ended up wasting a lot of time . __eou__ You better stop slacking off . __eou__ You're right . I'm not going to play games during school anymore . __eou__
I don't know what to do about the people who live in the flat above me ! __eou__ Why ? What are they like ? __eou__ They're incredibly selfish . They ' re always up until the wee hours of the night playing their music so loudly that I have to wear earplugs in order to fall asleep ! __eou__ Have you ever talked to them about it ? __eou__ I tried to introduce myself to them when they moved in , but they were so arrogant that I didin't want to ever talk to them again ! __eou__ What did they say ? __eou__ They both just talk about how great they are all the time . __eou__ They soud like the neighbours from hell ! __eou__ They are ! Besides being loud and arrogant , they're also terrible gossips . They're always talking about everybody else in the apartment . __eou__ I thought you didn't talk to them much . __eou__ I don't , but they talk so loudly that I can hear what they're talking about from my bedroom - and it's not very nice . __eou__ What do the other people in your apartment think about them ? __eou__ Most of my other neighbours are scared of them . __eou__ Maybe you should think about moving . __eou__ I can't afford to move right now . __eou__ Well , perhaps you should have a party and try to get to know them better . Maybe once you get to know them , they'll turn out to be more sensitive . __eou__ I think you're being a bit optimistic . If you met them , you'd understand . __eou__ Well , I don't know what else you could do then . Do you think bribing them with chocolate would work ? __eou__
I want to buy some running shoes . Maybe New Balance . __eou__ Why do you need running shoes ? You aren't a runner . __eou__ But I exercise at the club . And I use the stepping machine.So I need good running shoes . __eou__ That's not the same.Maybe you want to buy running-shoe-style shoes , but not real running shoes . __eou__ What's the difference ? __eou__ There isn't much difference . But there is some difference.For one thing , real running shoes are much more expensive.They have very lightweight materials.They ' re designed for serious runner __eou__ And what are running-shoe-style shoes ? __eou__ They look like running shoes.They have the same shape . And you can use them for running too.But they're not so serious . They aren't designed for serious runners.You can use them for exerce __eou__ But they aren't as light , right ? __eou__ That's right.If you want a really lightweight shoe , you should buy a high-quality running shoe . __eou__ That's what I want.For exercising at the club . I can even spend 100 dollars on them . I don't care . __eou__ But it's a waste of money . You won't really run in them ! You don't need such a shoe to use exercise machines . It's just a waste of money . __eou__ My sister has New Balance running shoes . I want shoes just like hers . I don't care if they're expensive . And they look cool too . __eou__ Well , do what you like.There are different kinds of New Balance shoes though.You don't have to buy the most expensive . __eou__ I want the best.My sister said good shoes are very important . For support . They support your feet . __eou__ Your sister is a fitness expert , huh ? __eou__ No , but she exercises more than me . __eou__ I really think you are stubborn about some things.But here . Let's look at the New Balance shoes . __eou__ Here it is . This is what my sister has . __eou__ Yes , that's it . That's their top model . __eou__ I wonder if they have my size . __eou__ Well , we can wait for the assistant to help us , or we can look through the boxes down here . What is your size ? __eou__ Here in America , it's six . __eou__ Well , here you are . Size six . Woman's . 137 dollars.Wow , what a waste of money ! __eou__ It's none of your business . Let me try them on . __eou__

Really , what happened ? __eou__ Well , it was all a big mistake , actually . He got home on Friday night really late , and apparently he'd been out drinking with some clients , so he was really drunk . __eou__ Was he out with the guys from the bank ? __eou__ Yes , I think so . __eou__ Oh , yeah , they always get really drunk . __eou__ Well , anyway , he'd somehow lost his wallet and his house keys , so he couldn't get in . He lives alone , you know . __eou__ Oh , really . I thought he lived with his wife . __eou__ No , she left him last year . __eou__ Oh , really ? Do you know why ? __eou__ Hang on , let me finish telling you what happened . Where was I ? __eou__ He lost his wallet and keys . __eou__ Oh yes , well , he tried to climb in through the bathroom window , but apparently he slipped and broke the glass with his foot . The neighbors heard him and thought a robbery was in progress , so they called the police . __eou__ Oh , no . __eou__ Yes . So when the cops arrived , they didn't believe his story __eou__ So then what happened ? __eou__ Well , when he sobered up , he called someone from work to come and bail him out . __eou__ Well , that's a bit of a tricky situation . __eou__ Yes , I know . __eou__
I don't know if you remember , but with honest every day last year we tided the knot . __eou__ Of course I remember , actually , I am very surprised you remembered , I thought for sure you would forget . __eou__ How could I ever forget ? I even bought you roses because I love you . __eou__ They are so beautiful . I love them , and I love you too . __eou__ You are more beautiful than the roses . __eou__ I don't know how , but I love you more than the day we gotta married . __eou__ Yes , we are match made in heaven . __eou__ I know of the past years we have faced and shared troubles , but we survived and here we are . __eou__ Yes , we did , we did have problems , but we shared a lot of happiness too . We countered the problems , and had a lot of happiness too . __eou__ Yes we did . __eou__ I love you , happy anniversary . __eou__ I love you , happy anniversary . __eou__
Hi , Sarah . The results of questionnaire have come out . We need to discuss it together then write a research report . __eou__ How is the new product ? __eou__ 30 % of the people are attracted by the style . Buyers always pay great attention to packing . In my opinion , these goods didn't sell well merely because of the poor packing . __eou__ Yes , I think so . And how about the price ? __eou__ Almost 30 % of the consumers can ’ t accept the price . Maybe we should lower our price a little . __eou__ Yes , I agree with you . We should add our opinions to the research report . __eou__ Absolutely . __eou__
have you finished going through the contract ? __eou__ yes , but I have a few questions for you . __eou__ Ok . Ask away . __eou__ first , I ’ d like to know if you offer employees sick leave . __eou__ yes , employees can take up to 10 days of sick leave per year . However , in order to get paid , you ’ ll have to bring in a note from the doctor ’ s . __eou__ even if I ’ m only sick for one day ? __eou__ that ’ s correct . __eou__ that ’ s pretty strict , if you ask me . __eou__ well , we ’ Ve had to add that to the contract because we found that many of our employees were taking almost one sick day a month , even though they weren ’ t sick . __eou__ I see . I guess that makes sense . __eou__ do you have any other questions ? __eou__ yes . Maternity leave is mentioned in the contract , but there ’ s nothing in the contract alout paternity leave . Do you offer anything to fathers ? __eou__ we do actually . We can add that as an amendment to your contract . __eou__ how many days of paternity leave do you offer ? __eou__ men are allowed to take 10 days of paternity leave for their first child . __eou__ why are women allowed so much more time for maternity leave ? __eou__ well , women are the ones giving birth . I think it ’ s fair to give them more time , don ’ t you ? __eou__ I guess so . I don ’ t have any other questions . Should I sign here then ? __eou__ yes , please . __eou__
Do you drive a car yourself ? __eou__ Yes , I just bought new car , I drive to work everyday ! __eou__ Great ! When you become new driver , you are better drive as carefully as possible ! __eou__ Sure , I see safety is most important thing ! Accident is awful ! I will take your advice ! __eou__ Besides , traffic signal in downtown area are very annoying , are they ? __eou__ Yes , definitely ! You can't drive freely ! __eou__ Now , we are out of the town , you can drive freely ! __eou__ Compare with speaking , yes ! But things are not good as you expecting ! __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Can you see that road side help ? __eou__ Yes , We are going to across real road . __eou__ That's right . We have to slow down again . If we haven't meet the passing tree , we have to stop a car away . __eou__ What other signs what we see in road area like this ? __eou__ There are a plenty of signs such as Watch for children ! __eou__
How did you spend the weekend ? __eou__ I went to a movie with my boyfriend . __eou__ Really ? How was it ? __eou__ It was great . The director took a lot of care while framing . They say be has good chance at winning the Oscar for best director . Also I like the actors , some really great new young actors . __eou__ Oh , yeah ? What's it about ? __eou__ Well , it's the classic love story between two people from conflicting backgrounds . But besides a beautiful story , the cinematography is great . There is some really dramatic footage . It's really quite a visual feast . And the soundtrack is moving . __eou__ Sounds pretty good . Is it a tragedy ? __eou__ The ending is a bit of a surprise . I don't want to ruin it for you . __eou__ Oh , I like movies with surprise endings , although , sometimes they can be frustrating . Maybe I should invite my girlfriend to go next weekend . __eou__ It would be a really good choice . The movie is very suitable for lovers to see together . I'm sure you won't regret it . __eou__
Why have you stopped production ? __eou__ We've had a few problems . One of the bolts has worked loose and a blade has snapped off . __eou__ OK . Make sure the power is switched off then tighten up all the bolts on the unit and replace the broken blade . Why is there oil all over the floor ? __eou__ I think the valve is faulty . I couldn't regulate the pressure and the seal burst . I tried opening the emergency valve but it was jammed . __eou__ Clean up the mess first , then fit a new seal and check the valve . __eou__
Here is the draft contract , Mr . Brown . Let's discuss the clauses to see if we agree on all of them . Then I will make out an original of the contract . After that , what's left is to fill out the contract and sign our names . __eou__ That's OK . __eou__ The contract is to be written in Chinese and English . Both languages are equally effective . __eou__ Fine . If you'll excuse me , I'd like to go it over first . ( After about 15 minutes ) Hmm , you've done a pretty good job . It's well prepared . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Well , I suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time . __eou__ That's a good idea . __eou__ First , let's read Clause Two about packing . It's our usual practice to ship our products in containers . That'll save time and money , but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases . So , we'd like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract . __eou__ Agreed . __eou__ For shipment , you know we are producing a complete set of equipment for you and it won't all be finished at one time . So would you allow us to make partial shipments . __eou__ I understand your position . __eou__
Have we handed out all the water ? __eou__ Yes . So what else to do now ? __eou__ Nothing . The teacher said the only thing left was to get back all the disposable cups later . __eou__ I see . How do you like the game ? __eou__ Terrific . There is one girl said , It is the best game I've ever watched . __eou__ Who do you think do better ? __eou__ Clive was really outstanding . Not only he put on a big show himself , but also he inspired the whole team . __eou__ Exactly . He is unbelievable . __eou__ On the other hand , I think the other team won everyone's respect . The leader said they could have crumpled at the beginning , but they just carried on and never lost their cool . __eou__ They were really tough . __eou__ The thing I like most about them is that they did not play with a heavy heart even though at that time the odds seemed to be against them . __eou__ I can't agree more . Okay , time is up . Let's do the last thing . __eou__
well , I finished my last final today . __eou__ the end of all the hard work for my master's . what a nice feeling to get my degree ! __eou__ do you want to attend the convocation ? __eou__ certainly . After years of hard work , I wouldn't miss it . By the way , where can I find cap and gown ? __eou__ do you want to have them made or do you want to rent them ? __eou__ oh , I think they're provided by the school for that special day . __eou__ no . those you have to provide for yourself . __eou__ what do most of the students do ? __eou__ well , most of them only need a cap and gown for that particular convocation service , but some of the education majors have had them made , because they will be faculty members , and they'll need them f __eou__ then , I might as well have them made . __eou__ Mary , don't move . Stand right there . It's a good shot . The background is very pretty . __eou__ hold it a second . I want to fix my hairpin . __eou__ it doesn't matter . Say'cheese ' . __eou__ here's Lisa . May I take a picture with her ? __eou__ Certainly . Ok , got you . __eou__
Are you alright , Ethan ? You don't seem to be as cheerful as you normally are . __eou__ To be honest , Ava , I've just had a really bad day . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ First , I slept through my alarm and ended up two hours late to work . __eou__ What did your boss say ? __eou__ He told me that if I showed up late one more time , he'd fire me . He's so mean ! __eou__ That's horrible . Was that the first time you'd shown up late to work ? __eou__ That was my second time . The first time , I was in a car accident . __eou__ Is your boss Chinese ? __eou__ No , he's from Australia . Before I met him , I thought Australians were supposed to be relaxed and easy-going . I had no idea he'd be so fussy about things . __eou__ What are you going to do ? __eou__ I think I'm going to look for another job . I need to find a boss that is a bit more sensitive and optimistic than my current boss . __eou__ That sounds like a sensible plan . Do you want me to help you with your job search ? __eou__ That's very generous of you . Thanks for the offer . __eou__ Don't mention it . That's what friends are for ! __eou__
Daddy , what's next ? What else do we do now ? __eou__ There is a man-made fishing pond nearby . So , What do you think of going fishing there ? __eou__ Great . Let's go . Where is it ? __eou__ Patience , boy . A watched pot never boils . We shall get out fishing stuff first and make some baits , too . __eou__ We have many cookies left here . Can we use them as baits ? __eou__ I don't think fish would like them . Instead , they love earth worms . __eou__ So let's go and catch earth worms ! __eou__ OK . I think that's enough for today . Let's go . __eou__ Daddy , do you think we're gonna catch any fish today ? We've been fishing here for more than two hours , and we get nothing . __eou__ That's because you're talking to me all the time . Be patient , or there will be no chance to have sashimi for dinner today . __eou__ I love sashimi . Did mom bring any soy sauce for that ? __eou__ I suppose she did . Be quiet . There is a fish on the hook . Here it is . Look , a big one . __eou__ Cool . Hey , I've got an idea . Why don't we cook it separately ? Half for sashimi , and the other half for grill . __eou__ Great idea . But the fact is we have no barbecue with us . Moreover , the sashimi will be great . So why do we bother to waste time on barbecuing the fish ? __eou__ Well , all right . There is nothing to complain about . __eou__
Ok ! I ’ m ready for my driving lesson ! Should I start the car ? __eou__ Hold on there , Fittipaldi , first let ’ s go over things one more time . Now before you even think of starting the car , make sure your seat is at a comfortable position and you can grip the steering wheel firmly . Next check your rear view mirrors to make sure you can see properly . __eou__ We have been through this a million times ! Let ’ s get going already ! I ’ m ready ! __eou__ Fine , start the car . now gently step on the clutch and shift to 1st gear . Good , now accelerate gently and let go of the clutch as you do it . There we go , good ! __eou__ I ’ m doing it ! I ’ m driving ! This is awesome ! Let ’ s turn some music on ! __eou__ Keep your eyes on the road ! No music ! We are coming up to a red light , step on the brakes . What are you doing ? I said the brakes ! Look out for those people ! Get off the sidewalk ! __eou__ Get out of my way ! This is just like playing video games ! __eou__ It ’ s the police ! Pull over ! __eou__ They ’ ll never take me alive ! __eou__
Excuse me . __eou__ Yeah ? __eou__ I've never used this place before.Can you give me some idea what I need to do ? __eou__ You just put quarters in the machines.It ' s easy . __eou__ Yes , but ... well ... __eou__ What ? __eou__ How do I use the machines ? __eou__ What do you mean ? These are the washing machines . Those big things over there are the dryers . __eou__ I see . Do the machines have soap in them ? __eou__ No , of course not . You have to put soap in . Did you bring your soap ? __eou__ No . I don't have soap . __eou__ Well , you can buy some from that vending machine over there . __eou__ Thanks.Okay . I have my soap . __eou__ My God ! You really bought a lot . Why do you need so much ? __eou__ I don't know . I want my clothes to be clean . __eou__ But you can't use so much.The machine won't be able to rinse the soap out . __eou__ Oh . I guess I didn't know . I have never washed clothes before . __eou__ What ? Did you say you never washed clothes before ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ In your life ? Are you kidding ? Never ? __eou__ No . Never . __eou__ I can't believe it . How can that be ? How old are you ? __eou__ I'm nineteen . __eou__ But how can you live nineteen years without ever washing clothes ? __eou__ My mother always did it . __eou__ Yes , my mother washed my clothes too.But when I was twelve , I started to wash clothes myself . __eou__ I know about this fact.American children are more independent . They do more for themselves.But I am from Taiwan . In Taiwan , children must study very hard.So the mother does everything for the kids.The mother wants her kids to get very good grades at school.So I've never washed clothes before . You shouldn't laugh at me for it . __eou__ I'm not laughing at you . But let me ask you something ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ How are you going to survive here ? I mean , if you can't do anything for yourself.If you can't cook , if you can't wash clothes , if you can't clean house.How can you live on your own ? __eou__ I don't know . It's hard . But I have to learn . __eou__ Well , I'll help you learn how to use these machines . __eou__ Thanks . My name's Nick . __eou__ I'm Alice . I guess I'll have to be your mother for today . __eou__ Thanks , Mom . Thanks . __eou__
I see there are some workmen on the site . When is the building work due to start ? __eou__ Well , it'll take three weeks to demolish the old building and clear away the debris . We should be ready to start the construction work in week 23 . __eou__ How long will the sub contractors be on site ? __eou__ About ten weeks in total if everything goes according to plan . __eou__ I'm sure it will . So , we should be able to start moving the machinery in during week 34 . I'll confirm that date with our suppliers . __eou__
OK , so this is our newest machine . It was only installed last year . __eou__ What's the running speed of the machine ? __eou__ About 1,500 metres per minute . It's one of the fastest in the world . We had a few problems with it after start-up but it's running very well now . __eou__ And what's the maximum output ? __eou__ If we're running at full capacity , it's 160,000 tonnes per annum . __eou__
Could you explain the paper-making process to us - in very simple terms - please ? __eou__ Well , the pulp falls from a box onto the first part of the paper machine , which is basically a wire bed with large holes in it , where most of the water is extracted . __eou__ So , is it actually paper at this stage ? __eou__ Yes , it is . But we need to take out more water . So it then passes through a series of rollers , where more water is squeezed out . After that it goes through the dryers , which are at a very high temperature . The paper is then coated . And finally it's wound onto reels and cut down into smaller lengths . __eou__
Hi , have you got the exact number of people who are going take part in this activity ? __eou__ Yes , there are 62 in totals , and 2 of them still can't be sure . __eou__ They always push the time . How many of them are over fifty ? __eou__ 6 . So we should give them special attention . Some of them don't have a good health . __eou__ OK , I see . As far as you think , how many buses should we get for them ? __eou__ 2 should be enough , for each one has at least 30 seats . There will be some seats to spare . __eou__ I'll call the bus charter later . And have you announced the itinerary of this journey to all of them ? __eou__ Yes , most of them think it's good . But , some people have different opinions . They consider we should arrange some challenging activities . __eou__ That's possible . At that time , they can choose any activity they like . __eou__ That's good . I'll tell them later . And what kind of medicine we should be prepared ? __eou__ Let me think ! Pills for carsick , traditional medicine for cold , some painkillers and something like that . __eou__ OK , we should get them ready this afternoon . __eou__ One more thing , have you got all people's phone numbers ? __eou__ Oh , God . I've almost forgotten . I'll get it done right away . __eou__
Good morning . I came in answer to your advertisement for a salesperson . __eou__ I see . Will you walk this way , please ? What experience have you had ? __eou__ I'm afraid I haven't had any experience in just this sort of work . I'm studying business administration in college . I want to get a job that would tie in with my studies . __eou__ Have you got any selling experience at all ? __eou__ I worked in a department store in a small town last summer vacation . __eou__ Now tell me about your educational background . __eou__ I graduated from Beijing University . I majored in business administration . __eou__ What courses have you completed ? __eou__ The courses I completed are marketing , business law , business English , statistics , marketing principles , sales management , distribution theory , economies and psychology . __eou__ What subjects did you like most at university ? __eou__ I liked sales strategies most . __eou__ Why would you like to work with us ? __eou__ It's an interesting job , and your company is one of the best known . Although I have no work experience as a salesperson , the job description you sent was very interesting . It's a job I've been dreaming of when I was at university . __eou__ What are your future plans and what kind of expectations do you have of the company ? __eou__ I have an interest in marketing and I would consider graduate study in business in the future . I think my goals will become more clear as I gain experience in sales and marketing . __eou__ Good . Do you know anything about this company ? __eou__ Yes , a little . As you mentioned just now , yours is an American capital company . As far as I know your company is a world famous one which produces cosmetics and skincare products . __eou__ Have you got anything to ask me ? __eou__ Will traveling be required in this position ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ How often ? __eou__ Three times a year at most . How do you feel about this ? __eou__ That's fine . __eou__
Welcome to IBA . What can we assist you with today ? __eou__ Hello . Yes , I've just read your leaflet about the new MoneyLink Card . I was wondering how I go about applying for one . __eou__ This scheme has just started and you will be one of our first 100 customers , so if your application is accepted , you will receive some rather nice perks . __eou__ That does sound good . I'm already an account holder , have been for many years . And I already have your existing card . __eou__ That should make things perfectly simple , then . Actually , if you had waited a little while longer , we would have notified you by post . __eou__ Perhaps your letter is already in the mail ! So , I can just upgrade automatically ? __eou__ May I have your details , and I'll check for you . __eou__ Certainly ... __eou__ OK , so you are already a gold card holder , with a sound credit history . That means we can automatically upgrade you to our new platinum card . __eou__ Wonderful ! And , you mentioned ' perks ' ? I do hope I'll be getting some of those . __eou__
are you working overtime again ? Over the last two weeks , you have worked overtime every day without a break ! Your company is draining the life out of you ! __eou__ I know , but I don't have a choice , my boss has complete control over our work schedules . I haven't made it out of the office before 9 PM a single day this week . __eou__ Well , I hope they're paying you the big bucks for all this work ... __eou__ No , not exactly , I'm working for minimum wage.And they don't give extra pay for overtime . Overtime is our own time . __eou__ What ? ! Isn't there a law against that , I think there is some legislation that requires employers to give their employees a fair rate of wages . You should know your rights ! If you are putting in so many hours , they should give you some kind of compensation . __eou__ They do give bonuses at the end of the year for the employees with highest productivity numbers , but frankly , it's not much of an incentive . They give us a bonus of ten dollars . __eou__ That's just wrong ! why don't you just quit ? __eou__ I would , but I'm afraid I would't be able to find another job . I don't have very many job marketable skills , there aren't so many jobs that I'm qualified for . __eou__ it sounds like any job will be better than the one you have now ! __eou__
Aren ’ t you interested in watching the Olympics ? There have been some excellent performances by athletes from all over the world . __eou__ I just don ’ t find it very interesting . __eou__ I think it ’ s wonderful to see people from all over the world taking part in such a great event . __eou__ I think that for a lot of people , it ’ s just a way to try and show their country is better than other countries . __eou__ I think the Olympics help to promote world peace . __eou__ I ’ m not sure about that . We still have many wars in the world . I think that the idea behind the Olympics is a good one , but the reality is that during the Olympics countries compete . There ’ s no real spirit of cooperation and people are usually not very friendly to each other . __eou__ You are so pessimistic ! The Olympics is a great opportunity for athletes to demonstrate their speed , skill , agility and strength . Most people hope to see someone from their country win , but I think that they are just happy to see good performances by any athlete . __eou__ Well . I think that the most amazing performances are by athletes who participate in the Paralympics . __eou__ Now there we are in agreement ! __eou__
We've got a problem ... it looks like we'll need more spotlights on the exhibition booth . The client thinks it's too dark , and they want to add halogen lighting . We've already got 3 sets of track lighting from you guys , do you think you could help us out and throw in some halogens ? __eou__ Oh ... Um ... I don't think so . you know the halogen lighting is much more expensive than your track lighting system . Plus I'm going to have to call in some guys to install it for you . That's not going to come cheap . __eou__ But it would only be adding to the existing structure . We're not talking about anything new here ... __eou__ It doesn't matter because we will still have to call the electrician out , and they are union labor . It'll cost you a pretty penny ... __eou__ How much do you think it would cost ? __eou__ Mumm , I estimate it'll run in the neighborhood of ... $ 500 per light . __eou__ $ 500per light ? ! That's ridiculous ! It can't possibly be that expansive ! __eou__ It is , I'll tell you why . We'll have to call in the electrician , he's going to charge overtime now because it's already 5PM , and it will probably take him an hour a light . Plus , the halogen lights take more electricity , so your electrical cost is going to be higher as well . __eou__ Can't you give me a break on this ? We've already spent so much money on lighting , I hate to have to blow so much more on halogens . __eou__ No , that's the cost , and that's what it's going to cost us . We can't go in the hole with this . I am giving you my best price , so take it , or leave it . __eou__
Excuse me , is this the right counter for express mail ? __eou__ Yes , it is . What can I do for you ? __eou__ I want to send some important documents to Canada for my postgraduate admission . __eou__ Are they urgent , please ? __eou__ Yes , the deadline for applying is 1st Feb , so I hope they will arrive in 3 days . __eou__ Well , DHL is famous for its speed and reliability . It is the fastest international postal service available . The document will arrive in two or three days . __eou__ Really ? But can you guarantee the safety ? __eou__ Yes , I promise . Your document won't be broken or lost . All the items are handled by special staff and carried by a courier . It is reliable . __eou__ OK . I will send them now . __eou__ Please write the address and remittee on the express order and make sure there is no mistake on them . __eou__ All right . Here you are . __eou__ This is your receipt which you have to keep until the remittee receives the express . You can also check your post on our web . The post number is on the top of the receipt . __eou__ Thank you . I have got quite clear idea of it . __eou__
Is it your first time to join the sports meeting of Junior High School ? __eou__ Yes , and it's great . What are the events at the sports meeting ? __eou__ Long-distance race , dash , hurdle race , relay race , standing long jump , high jump , shotput and so on . __eou__ Our neighbor , Bruce , will take part in the relay race . Let's go have a look . __eou__ OK , let's go . __eou__ The competition will begin in 5 minutes , it's tense here . __eou__ Wonderful , Bruce is taking the lead . __eou__ Other competitors have almost caught up with him . They are neck and neck . __eou__ Come on , Bruce . Come on , Bruce . __eou__ Wow , Bruce crossed the line first . __eou__
Who stands out in your mind as a man or woman of sound character ? __eou__ If I think of famous people , I think of Abraham Lincoln . __eou__ He's the US president , who walked five miles just to give a lady her change , isn't he ? __eou__ That's the one . He also was famous for never giving up on his goals . __eou__ That's right . He ran for office quite a few times before he was finally elected . __eou__ And I also admire him for his courage in fighting for equal rights . __eou__ He had great vision , didn't he ? __eou__ And humility . I would have liked to meet him personally . __eou__
Hi , Larry , how was your weekend ? __eou__ Not bad . We had a get-together with friends from college . I haven't seen many of them since graduation . How about you ? __eou__ Great . I hung out with Jo all day shopping , and the went out for dinner together . __eou__ Sounds a good weekend . You know it always amazes me that two people as different as you and Jo can become such close friends . __eou__ Yeah , I never thought we could be good friends either . We have our differences . She's more outgoing and active while I am more quiet and reversed , but we still get along extremely well . We can talk for hours about anything . __eou__ That's great . I know people who can't stand each other for even five minutes . __eou__ When Jo and I are together , we argue a lot , but that's also part of the fun . Besides , I know she will always be there for me when I need her , and she knows I'll be there for her . __eou__ It seems you two bring out the best of one another . __eou__ Exactly . Having Jo as my friend is one of the best things that's ever happened to me . __eou__ Yeah , you are so lucky to have found each other . __eou__ Thanks , I think so too . __eou__
Susan has got the cancer of stomach . __eou__ How terrible ! This is quite unexpected ! __eou__ Yesterday when I went to hospital to see her , you cannot imagine how greatly surprised when I saw her . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ Because of atomic cocktail and other medicines , all of them have the side effect . she has lost all her hair . __eou__
Do you want to hang out tomorrow ? __eou__ Oh , I can't . I have a date ! __eou__ Really ? Wow with who ? __eou__ This girl I've been chatting with for the past couple of months . She's really cool and she's driving over here this weekend . __eou__ Wait a minute , you mean you met her online ? __eou__ Yeah ! I signed up for a website called match @ . com and it is great ! You fill in all your details and preferences , like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets . Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat . __eou__ That is kind of weird ! What if she is a psycho or something like that ? __eou__ It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them ! I am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends ! I think this is a really cool alternative , especially if you are a bit shy . __eou__ I guess it does seem logical . I'll have to check it out ! __eou__
I can't seem to progress up the career ladder no matter how hard I try and I have been here for 2 years already ! __eou__ Well , have you thought of getting an MBA ? I heard it does wonders in getting you to the top . __eou__ An MBA , hey . . . well my degree wasn't in business , the business schools won't be interested in me . __eou__ Nonsense ! The business schools measure your ability through a test called GMAT . __eou__ GMAT ? What does that stand for and what will the test contain ? __eou__ Graduate Management Admission Test , it contains three parts __eou__ Okay , this sounds a little tough , how am I supposed to practice for this ? __eou__ Up to you , you could have a one on one session with a tutor or group sessions , you can also use free or private computer software . Going to church might help as well ! __eou__ No matter what I do , I'm going to ace this test and go on to become a corporate fat cat ! __eou__ Umm . . . That's the spirit ! __eou__
Hello , Jim . What was the film like ? __eou__ Awful . It was a complete waste of time . __eou__ Why ? What was it about ? __eou__ It was about a married couple . They had to live with the wife's mother , because they didn't have enough money to buy a house of their own . __eou__ A lot of young people have to do that . __eou__ Yes . but the husband had to work overtime three times a week , so he was always tired . __eou__ lt sounds like the story of my life . __eou__ Yes , it does , doesn't it ? But this man was always over-tired , and he couldn't sleep.So he used to take two sleeping pill every night . __eou__ I take sleeping pills sometimes . __eou__ Yes , but not two every night . Anyway , the strain was too much for him . He had nervous breakdown and had to go to hospital . __eou__ It sounds a very depressing film . __eou__ Not really . His wife was able to find a good job as an interpreter , because she could speak French and German fluently . After a few months ' work , she had a better job than her husband . So in the end , __eou__ I don't know . My wife used to speak French . I must tell her to brush it up . __eou__
Mary , please go to the door . I hear the bell . __eou__ It's the mailman , Mother . Here's a letter from Uncle George . __eou__ Give it to me ... How wonderful ! He's coming to visit us . __eou__ When's he coming ? __eou__ He's coming by car on the twenty-fourth . He's staying from thetwenty-fourth to the twenty-sixth . __eou__ Let me look at the calendar . Good ! The twenty-fourth is a Saturday . Is he coming alone ? __eou__ No , he's coming with Aunt Cynthia and the girls . __eou__ Mother , I don't remember the girls . How old are they ? __eou__ Your cousin Fay is fifteen . Rosemary is older than Fay . She's seventeen . __eou__ Are they going to stay here with us ? __eou__ Of course . The girls can stay in your room with you . __eou__ Mother , may we have a party ? __eou__ If you like , but now we have to think about meals and many other things . __eou__ Prepare the list , Mother . I can go shopping . I can go to the small stores.Everyone knows me there . __eou__
The channel boats are quite fast , aren't they ? __eou__ Yes , very . They make the trip in about an hour . __eou__ I hope we shan't have a rough passage . __eou__ No , I hope not . I want to have a deck chair and enjoy the crossing . __eou__ That's a good idea . __eou__ The sea seems quite calm , so there will be no fear of seasickness . Are you seasick ? __eou__ Yes , unfortunately . I'm very much subject to it . __eou__ I'm not a very good sailor , either . My mother is a dreadfully poor sailor . In fact , she never takes a voyage unless she has to . I am better than that , and even on the Pacific . after ten days of it , I can still find my sea legs . Well , happily we shall have a smooth passage today . __eou__ Yes , this little boat gets up a fine speed , and I think we'll soon get to the land . __eou__ Yeah , I am of the same opinion . __eou__
Hello , welcome to Credit Services . How can we help you ? __eou__ I'm interested in applying for a credit card with you . __eou__ Are you an existing customer ? __eou__ Yes , I've had a Current Account with a debit card with you for years . Now , I'm looking at upgrading to a credit card . __eou__ May I ask why you didn't think of applying for a credit card with us sooner ? Most young people jump at the chance . __eou__ When I opened the account with you , I was a student , I graduated a couple of years ago and have a steady salary , so I figured now would be the best time to go ahead . __eou__ That's very sensible of you . We have many fresh graduates applying for credit cards , getting them and then going on a spending spree and being unable to meet the repayments . __eou__ As you can see from the statements for my Current Account , I have never been overdrawn . I'm always very careful about that . __eou__

I don't eat or use any animal based products . I don't wear leather , eat eggs , drink milk or anything that comes from an animal .

I had to show it to pay for these shoes with my traveler's cheques . __eou__ Well , let me call the shoe department to see if they ’ Ve found a passport . Sorry , your passport hasn't turned up there either . __eou__ Then what shall I do ? __eou__ You can fill in this lost property report and I will keep my eye out for it .

Do you have a pen ? __eou__ Here you are . __eou__ Oh , I seem to lose something every time I travel . __eou__

It is essential to attach the importance to the quality of goods . It is the basement for the future cooperation . __eou__ That is good . And here I give you a piece of advice .

Can I open the packages to check the color and style ? __eou__ Of course , let me help you . __eou__ The color and style are consistent with the sample .

I had a terrible journey back from Bangkok last week . __eou__ Really ? Why ? What happened ? __eou__ Well , first of all , the taxi that was taking me from the client's office to the airport broke down on the freeway . __eou__ Oh , no . __eou__ Yes , and the driver didn't speak any English or Chinese and he didn't have a phone on him-can you believe it ? - and his radio didn't work . So there was no way he could get in touch with the office to get them to send another taxi . __eou__ So what did you do ? __eou__ Well , I actually thumbed a lift . __eou__ You what ? __eou__ Yes , I stood on the side of the freeway and stuck my thumb out , and a passing truck stopped and took me to the airport . __eou__ Wow , good for you . __eou__ Yes , except he drove really slowly , and I missed my flight . __eou__ Oh , no ! __eou__ Yes , so I had to wait three hours for the next one . I didn't get home till four in the morning , and when I got home I realized I'd left my house keys in my hotel in Bangkok . __eou__ You really have bad luck , don't you ? __eou__ Seems like it . __eou__
Have you every belonged to a political party ? __eou__ No , I haven ’ t , but I thought about joining the green party . __eou__ Really ? I know you are very concerned about the environment . You were a member of the pressure group Greenpeace , weren ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes . I was . But I didn ’ t have enough time to devote to it . __eou__ The green party have no chance of winning an election . The other parties are too big and popular . __eou__ You ’ re right . But smaller political and pressure groups can often influence large political parties . Any member of parliament can propose legislation and parties and pressure groups can raise awareness __eou__ Most people are not very politically aware . They often don ’ t understand the issues fully . __eou__ That ’ s true . But it ’ s a little strange because the media often reports on political events . You can read about them in newspaper or hear them on tv . __eou__
Hi , long time no see . How have you been ? __eou__ Oh , I've been fine , but I'm having some trouble with my son . __eou__ Tell me all about it . __eou__ Oh , he's 14 and in the past few months , he's become quieter and a bit secretive . He locks himself in his room and I think he's running around with the wrong crowd . __eou__ Oh , I see . What makes you think that ? __eou__ Well , he's become friends with a couple of older boys who are in a band . And one night last weekend , he came home really late , way past his curfew . __eou__ Really ? What happened ? __eou__ He told me that his friend's car broke down and they had to walk home . __eou__ I see what you mean . I understand why you're concerned . Have you tried talking to your son about it ? __eou__ I haven't yet . I just keep hoping it's just a phase he's going through . __eou__ You may be right , but it doesn't hurt to find out more about what's going on in his life . __eou__ You're right . I should talk to him . Sometimes , it's not easy being a parent . Thanks . It helps to get it off my chest . You're always so easy to talk to . __eou__ I don't know about that , but my door is always open . Stop by anytime . __eou__
Do you like shopping at flea markets ? __eou__ l love it . There is always something fascinating to discover . __eou__ The antiques market here in Paris is very famous .

Because you are a tourist , it might be harder for you to get really good prices . __eou__
Hello , Mr . Gao . We appreciate your letting us have the apartment . __eou__ My pleasure . You're a sweet couple . Do you have any questions ? __eou__ The ad said rent was thirty thousand .

It's forty NT per ping . __eou__ That's another one thousand six hundred ? __eou__ Yes , but that doesn't include cable . It's for cleaning and trash removal . You just leave your trash outside your door . __eou__
What's wrong with you ? __eou__ I'm trying to send the instruction book by E-mail , but I failed many , many times . And there is something wrong with the net maybe . It's so slow . __eou__ Well , maybe the net is slow now . Try it again . __eou__ I am used to editing with Word 2003 , and there are many pictures in the book . __eou__ It's beyond question . You can save it the same as a document . __eou__ I merely know how to send the direct letter . But I am not familiar with the attachment . __eou__ It's the same as usual . The only difference lies in that you need to paste the book as an attachment . __eou__ Can I mail the book if it is a large file ? __eou__ There are limitations to the capacity of an E-mail . Commonly it's no more than 4 MB . __eou__ What if it exceeds the capacity ? __eou__ You can divide it into several documents to mail . Or you can download the mentioned software from the warning . __eou__
My pal , you are so nervous recently . You don't need to be like that . __eou__ I am worried about that Arden will display all my drawbacks in the performance review . That will be embarrassing . __eou__ Just use your head . If you were definitely making some big mistakes , you would be informed . __eou__ I had a nightmare last night and I dreamt Arden told me that my performance fell short of his expectation . I was terrified to wake up after hearing that . __eou__ That is merely a dream . Remember , there is always room for us to have further improvement . I think we did the good job in the whole period . __eou__ I know what you are talking about . The performance evaluation process starts from the day we're hired . There is no surprise during the actual review . __eou__

I ’ m experienced in IBM-PC . I can operate familiarly a word-processor , a fax machine , a photo and other office equipment . __eou__
Ahem ... uh , sir , I beg your pardon ... Uh , mister , are you waiting to buy a ticket for the movie ? __eou__ What's it look like , lady ? This is the ticket line I'm standing in , isn't it ? __eou__ Well , yes , it is , but ... __eou__ So , what's your beef anyway , lady ? __eou__ You just cut into line , in front of me and everyone else , that's what ! Go take your place back at the end of the line , like every - one else ! __eou__ Oh sure , lady , and fat chance I'd get a ticket before they're sold out . I'm staying right here , understand ? So be a nice lady and butt out ! __eou__ Just what gives you the right ... ? __eou__ Because I'm no sucker ; only suckers go to the end of the line . It's as simple as that , lady . __eou__ Well , you're no gentleman , either . __eou__ Okay , lady , just to show what a gentleman I really am , I'll let you go in front of me . Now , just buy your ticket and shut your trap , will you , lady ? __eou__ Whew ! I got the last one . This must be my lucky day ! __eou__ What was that you just said ? Last one ... ? Hey , they've closed the ticket window ! __eou__ Yes , I'm afraid I bought the last ticket , and to think , if you hadn't been such a gentleman . . . __eou__ Lady ! This is unfair ! I've been cheated ! I was in line before you.That should have been my ticket ! Come on , hand it over , lady ! __eou__ Gentleman ! Hah ! Fat chance ! Hah ! Eat your heart out , sucker ! Hah ! __eou__
Let ' s got out tomorrow night . We can go to a bar and try to find you a girlfriend . __eou__ I don ' t think that ' s a good idea . I am just not good with approaching someone and starting up a conversation . __eou__ Maybe you just need a few pick-up lines , you know , break the ice . __eou__ Pick-up lines don ' t work ! __eou__ Come on ! You can just walk up to a girl and say “ If you were a booger I \ ' d pick you first . ” __eou__ What ? Come on ! That ’ s just lame ! No girl would fall for that ! __eou__ Fine , then you can say , “ So there you are ! I ' Ve been looking all over for YOU , the woman of my dreams ! ” __eou__ That ' s a good one ! I think that ' s pretty funny . __eou__ Yeah , so you make her laugh , you make a fool of yourself a little bit and then you buy her a drink . __eou__ Ok , how does this sound , “ I was so enchanted by your beauty that I ran into that wall over there . So I am going to need your name and number for insurance purposes . ” __eou__ Nice ! Let ' s go ! __eou__
Are you OK ? __eou__ I'm fine . I'm just so touched by the sad story . __eou__ So I can say now that you must have enjoyed the opera . Which scene is your favorite ? __eou__ I love them all . But if I had to name one as the best , I would say it's the ending . __eou__ What's it about ? You know , I couldn't help falling asleep . __eou__ Did you ? I didn't notice that . But still you should know it , for you have seen it with Laura before . __eou__ I guess I've done the same thing last time I was here with her , too . I mean falling asleep . For me , this one is not that attractive . __eou__ Then I doubt if you like operas at all . __eou__ Yes . I like Carmen very much . But I don't mind if you want to tell me about this one . __eou__ OK , then . The man was old and he was visiting his wife's grave , with a rose in his hand . When he got there , he saw someone already put a rose on her grave . __eou__ Very impressive . And I do like the leading actress who has an amazing voice . __eou__ Me , too . There was always a good round of applause every time she sings . __eou__ Yes , the applause ! That was what kept waking me up during the show . __eou__ And it's been such a faultless performance with the perfect lighting , and music . Just amazing ! __eou__ No doubt , it's not a simple thing to put on a ' phantom show ' . __eou__ Exactly . __eou__

Thank you , Shirley . __eou__
Hey , Leo . How come you look so terrible ? What ’ s going ’ on ? __eou__ You can say that again . Susan ’ brother dropped in from out of town , so I offered to put him up for a few days . But he ’ s driving me up a wall . This guy is bottomless pit . __eou__ How gross ! I can ’ t handle people like that . Does he at least give you a hand around the house ? __eou__ He doesn ’ t lift a finger ! I bend over backwards cleaning up all day and he sleeps in until noon . __eou__ Man , what a freeloader . You better do something quick or he ’ ll never hit the road . After all , he ’ s got it made in the shade here . __eou__ You think he might stay even longer ? ! __eou__ Now , don ’ t go losing your temper . If you tolerated all you can , just kick him out ... but do it with gloves . I know ! Tell him a white lie like you ’ re getting the house fumigated ! __eou__ That wouldn ’ t be a lie ! __eou__

This zoo is really huge . __eou__ Yes , you can find hundreds of various animals here . It is the biggest zoo in Taiwan . __eou__ Look at the map . It has different areas , such as marine lives , mammals , polar animals and insects . __eou__ Where can find the pandas ? I think we are here to see the pandas . __eou__ We have to go to the mammal area . We are at the gate right now . We need to go straight from here and turn left and go along to the end and make anotherleft turn . __eou__ It should take at least 20 minutes to get there . Are there any shuttle buses running place to place around the whole zoo ? __eou__
OK , Devon , I've been putting on a few pounds and you're quite a lean fit guy . __eou__ Well , thank you . __eou__ What do you recommend ? What can I do to lose weight ? __eou__ Well , I exercise a lot . I go running at least three times a week . But more than that I enjoy playing sports and so different sports use different muscles and all of it helps to lose that weight that you might have gained . __eou__ Yeah , well , actually , one of the problems is that I actually exercise a lot . __eou__ Do ya ? __eou__ Yeah , so maybe it's my diet . __eou__ It could be and so in that case you might want to eat something perhaps more nutritious or maybe even less of what you do eat . Maybe , I eat three meals a day and I try not to snack in between . No potato chips . No popcorn . No candy bars . __eou__ That's pretty tough ! __eou__
Hey , Benjamin , have you finished your report on the project ? __eou__ Not yet . To tell you the truth , I don't know how to write it . I've considered it for several days . __eou__ What ? Man , you don't know how to write a project report ? That's sounds a little bit ridiculous . __eou__ Don't laugh at me , please . I'm serious . I've never been required to write this kind of report before , I only do the research reports . __eou__ Oh , sorry , I've totally forgotten that you are a workaholic . __eou__ So what items must be involved in this report ? __eou__ First is your final conclusion on your work of this year , and then comes your plan for the next year . __eou__ Yeah , is that all ? __eou__ Let me see , no , you have to include more details about your final conclusion , for example , your experiences in dealing with some emergent events . __eou__ That's too complicated . __eou__ And only that doesn't make a perfect one , you also have to pay attention to the format of the report . __eou__ Oh , my God , is there any fixed for mat for it-the one that I just need to fix my information in ? __eou__ I'm sorry . There isn't . Because different people have to write different kinds of reports . __eou__ But I don't know how to work the Microsoft Words . Could you please give me a hand ? __eou__ OK , no problem . But you have to learn it and then do it yourself next time . __eou__
Do you have any plan to buy a house in this city ? __eou__ Absolutely we need a house here . But what makes me upset is the prices in this city . __eou__ Our monthly salary can not buy one square meter of the house here . __eou__ It is depressing to hear the price goes higher and higher . __eou__ More and more people need to buy houses , but the market can not meet the needs , so this caused the bubble in real estate industry . __eou__ And the rich still wants to buy more , even though they have at least one house to live . __eou__ Have you watched the TV series , Humble Abode ? __eou__ Yes , it displays some social problems and interprets the values of our white-collars . __eou__ I really , really want a house , even though it is small like a snail house . __eou__
What can I do for you ? __eou__ I've got a suit , a woolen sweater and a white shirt to wash . __eou__ OK , let me see . This white shirt can be washed in water with hands , but this suit and the woolen sweater should be dry-cleaned . __eou__ That's OK . But that must be costly . __eou__ Yes , the cost for dry-cleaning is three times of that for ordinary laundering . But for suits and sweaters , you can only take them to the dry cleaners ' . __eou__ Oh , my wife just threw them into the washer . __eou__ Did it ever shrink or fade ? Generally speaking , the dark-colored clothes always fade away gradually . __eou__ I see . The woolen sweater shrunk in the wash . __eou__ Never mind . You can leave them to me . __eou__ Oh , thanks . You know , I know little about this , so please tell me something that I should pay more attention to when I do washing . __eou__ It's very simple . Divide the clothes by the colors , and wash them in cold water . If you've got some special stains on them like sugar , coffee or something else please let the dry cleaner know . __eou__ I'll keep that in mind . And how much is it altogether ? __eou__ That will be 80 Yuan altogether . Here is your invoice . __eou__
So , you finally got your doctorate in genetics . Well done ! __eou__ Thanks . Now , I have to find a job . __eou__ What are you thinking of doing ? __eou__ I ’ d like to conduct some scientific research into genes . It would be wonderful to make a medical breakthrough . __eou__ There must be several private companies that are interested in employing someone like you . You could do some research for a university . There ’ s a lot of discussion about genetics nowadays . Someone wit __eou__ Many companies and universities investing resources in genetics , because there are so many possibilities . Few people know where next discoveries will be made . __eou__ Well , I hope scientists don ’ t decode to make a clone of me in the future ! I wouldn ’ t like to be the subject of an experiment . __eou__
Hi ! It's still seven o'clock . Are you crazy ? __eou__ I got the information that there is a killer sale at the shopping mall near our block . Get up and I will wait for you at the gate of our flat . __eou__ Every time when you glimpse some stylish clothes , you change into another person . __eou__ Stop complaining , OK ? __eou__ No wonder you are named shopaholic . __eou__ No , I am not a shopaholic , but a super shopaholic . And I really enjoy smelling the gorgeous clothes and new bags . __eou__ Wait a moment . And you can check where other sales are . __eou__
It ’ s a wonderful party , Joan , The food , the drink , the atmosphere ... Everyone is enjoying himself . __eou__ Thanks to your help.To our friendship . __eou__ Bottoms up ! By the way what kind of entertainment are we gonna have ? __eou__ Dancing . The boys from the Campus Band have promised to play music for us . __eou__ Oh , how wonderful ! Every girl on the campus has a crush on those handsome guys . __eou__ I'll surely make introductions for them . __eou__
May , is the university a terrible place ? __eou__ Surely not . Life in the university is fun . Why did you ask ? __eou__ Because you study day in and day out for the entrance exam . So I figure you would study even harder after you ’ Ve got in . __eou__ Studying in the university is not easy , but it's not as arduous as you think . __eou__ How do you know that ? You haven't got in yet . __eou__ Of course I know . I once attended Lisa's class , sitting quietly at the back of the classroom . __eou__ Oh , really ? Were you not caught ? __eou__ Of course not . You are allowed to attend any lecture , only if there are empty seats for you and you don't disturb the class . In universities , you study in a free and creative environment . __eou__ What do you want to study in the university ? Have you thought about it ? __eou__ This question has really been bothering me . I like Chinese literature , you know . But economics is really hot now , and it has a very good career prospect . __eou__ I will choose what I like . You don't know what a torture it is for me to study English , because I don't like English . __eou__ Though I like Chinese literature very much , I'm also interested in economics . It's a tough choice to make . __eou__ You can decide later . You will have choices before you submit your university application form . __eou__ Right . I have lots of time to think carefully before I make my final decision . __eou__
Dad , I want to learn how to drive this summer vacation . __eou__ That's a good idea . You'd better hurry up before they've filled all classes . Many people are learning how to drive now . __eou__ I will get registered now at once . Do you know any training schools ? __eou__ I am not sure . You can search for them on the Internet . __eou__ OK . look , I've typed driver schools , and there are so many results coming out . __eou__ Let me see . teetee Training School , summer program , 3,000 Yuan , learn how to drive within one month , and get driver's license within three months . __eou__ 3,000 Yuan is a little bit steep . __eou__ I think so . Let's see the next one , 3,500 Yuan , summer program . Forget it . __eou__ I've heard that the Ideal Life School is famous . They offer many programs and there are many classes available . The charge is also fair . __eou__ Search on the Internet then , see if we can find something more about it . __eou__ Ah , got it . Ideal Life School , programs __eou__ Don't worry . Let's check out some other schools . __eou__
The government is going to organize a folk-custom activity at the end of the month . And our community is supposed to put on a performance . __eou__ What kind of performance ? A lion dance ? __eou__ Stuff like that but I think the lion dance is a bit too difficult and dangerous . __eou__ Sure , you'll be dancing with lions . What do you expect ? Then what about Range Dance which we did before . __eou__ Good idea . Shall we get everyone in the community ? __eou__ Maybe not . I think we should just focus on the retired people . __eou__ I know that they already have a Range Dance team and then what we need is just to do some rehearsals . __eou__ What about the costumes ? __eou__ We can raise money in the community . You know each family 10 yuan maybe . __eou__ Try something new . We can find a supporting agency . __eou__ Great idea . There is a travel agency nearby who would love to be our sponsor . It's a perfect chance for them to promote ethnic tourism . __eou__
Honey , which hand should I use to hold the fork ? __eou__ Left for the fork and right for the knife . Just remember that the stronger one is for knife . __eou__ Got it . It's so troublesome to have western food . I've been learning the table manners for hours but still can't really it . __eou__ Sure . Rather than eating , having western food is more about western culture . __eou__ Yeah . Which restaurant are we going to tonight ? __eou__ Cindy has reserved a table for us at a newly opened western restaurant downtown . She said the environment there was really pleasant . __eou__ Fine . I believe in Cindy's taste . Oh , what should I wear ? __eou__ You should put on the black suit I bought for you last week . But I'm afraid it may be a bit crumpled . You'd better iron it now . __eou__ I don't want to mess it up . Please do it for me . I'm going to the bank to cash some money . How much do we need ? __eou__ There is no need to do that . I think the restaurant accepts credit cards . But it's necessary to make a budget . __eou__ Honey , you are a good accountant . So I'd better leave that to you , too . __eou__ It seems that it's all about me . Then what do you do ? __eou__ I'll take care of the order . __eou__ OK then . Well , 50 Yuan for appetizer , 200 Yuan for dinner and 200 Yuan for wine . Anything else ? __eou__ Don't forget about the dessert . __eou__ OK , then 50 Yuan for dessert . 500 Yuan all together . __eou__

Are you a new student too ? __eou__ No . I'm a sophomore . I take it you are a new student ? __eou__ Yeah . It's pretty exciting to be here . __eou__ Have fun while it lasts . The excitement wears off real quick . Especially after you see how much homework you get . Where are you from ? __eou__ I'm from Korea . My parents wanted me to go to an American university , so I came here . __eou__ I have never been to Korea . I've been to Japan before , but never Korea . __eou__ Why were you in Japan ? __eou__ My father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country . He's so into learning about different cultures . __eou__ That's pretty cool . __eou__ I thought it would have been more fun if I went without my parents . __eou__ Well , if you ever want to visit Korea , I would be happy to show you around . __eou__ Thanks for the offer . I'll keep that in mind . Oh , the professor is coming . We'll talk more after class . __eou__ Ok . __eou__
Who's that man over there talking to James ? __eou__ Where ? Oh , that's Henry . __eou__ He's very handsome , isn't he ? What's he like ? __eou__ He's very nice , actually , but rather eccentric . __eou__ Really ? I love eccentric people . __eou__ Yes , but he may be too eccentric even for you . __eou__ Why ? What do you mean by that ? __eou__ Well , haven't you heard ? __eou__ Heard what ? No one ever tells me anything . __eou__ Well , apparently , he's been having an affair with his secretary . __eou__ Really ! How fascinating . __eou__ According to Mary , he's divorcing his wife and there's a big fight going on about the children . I thought everyone knew . __eou__ Well , what can I say ? I didn't know . Oh , I meant to tell you earlier , your blouse doesn't really match your skirt . Those colors don't really suit you either . __eou__ Oh . Thanks . Look , I must just go and say hello to someone . I'll be right back . __eou__
Nice to meet you here.How come you dropped into this company today ? __eou__ My boss sent me here to take some business documents back to his office . I didn't know you were working here.What a surprise.How long have you been doing this ? __eou__ Two years or so . __eou__ That is great.Do you have to work the night shift ? __eou__ No , in most cases I don't have to unless there is something urgent to deal with . I work five days a week . __eou__ Do you enjoy work here ? __eou__ It is hard to say.But I've to start by working as a trainee before I really become an experienced marketing assistant.Sometimes , I am really under great pressure when it gets busy . __eou__ Take it easy . I'm sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant . I hope you haven't been given much trouble in the job . __eou__ Luckily not.The silent I meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss . __eou__ Glad to hear that . __eou__
Hi , sir . Could you tell me where the Hilton Hotel is ? __eou__ Well , there are two Hilton Hotels around here . Which one is your destination ? __eou__ Eh , let me see . Sorry , I can't remember it , because I've been there only once , accompanied by my friends . __eou__ Then , it would be a little bit harder to find out your way . Do you remember the name of the street , or one or two landmarks ? __eou__ A bookstore , probably . With a yellow and orange logo . __eou__ Good , any other clues ? __eou__ I remembered there is a very busy street several miles away . I waited for the traffic light for a very long time . __eou__ Oh , is there a bank near there , Standard Charted possibly ? __eou__ Oh , yeah , I got it , there is a bank My friend exchanged her money there . __eou__ That's the second branch hotel of Hilton . Walk straight down and you will see the bookstore you just mentioned . Turn left , I believe , you will get it . __eou__ Great ! Many thanks ! __eou__
May I see the manager of your office ? __eou__ I'm afraid he's having an important meeting now . Can I help you ? __eou__ Thank you . I am Fred , coming from Future Clothes Company . I've brought some catalogues of our new series of the summer clothes . I wonder if your manager would like to have a look at them . __eou__ Of course , he would .

The prices are subject to our confirmation . __eou__
Good morning , everybody . Welcome to IAM Technology . I'm very pleased so many of you could make it here today . My name's Sam Weiss . I'm the Production Manager . I'd like to show you the layout of the factory before we go and visit it . As you can see from this diagram , everything is under one roof . We've designed it this way to help the flow of materials and to avoid bottlenecks . __eou__ This area here is where we keep our raw materials . The main production area - our machine hall - is situated next to it . Maintenance is situated between the stores and the production area . Just to the right of Maintenance , there are steps up to the Lab and the Admin Section . Process Control is also on the upper level . It's located above the factory floor so that the operators can monitor everything that is going on below . __eou__
Hello , Mr . Black , how are you ? __eou__ Fine , thank you , and how are you ? __eou__ Very well , thank you . It's nice to meet you again . I am awfully sorry for not being able to meet you at the airport , as I was busy yesterday . I do hope you had a very enjoyable trip from New York . __eou__ Yes , a very pleasant journey indeed . Thank you . __eou__ How are you getting along with your business ? __eou__ Not bad . The fur market is not very brisk lately , but the selling season is advancing near . I hope there will be more buyers in the market this year . __eou__ I hope we can do more business together . Though we are satisfied with our past trade record , there are still possibilities for more business . In the meantime , let's discuss other spheres of cooperation , such as investment , technology transfer and technical assistance . __eou__
Is there any way you can cut us a better deal on your wholesale price for this order ? __eou__ We did the best that we could to give you a low price . Did you get our recent estimate ? __eou__ Based on the estimate you gave us , by the time we figure in transportation and other expenses , our profit is short.With the offer you've given me , we're making next to nothing.Can ' t you do any better ? __eou__ I've already given you a discount of 20 % off of our normally charge . If I go any lower , we'll have loss on this project . I really want to work with you on this . But we've already gone as low as we can go . __eou__ I'll be honest with you , our budgeted cost can't exceed more than $ 150 per unit.That is our bottom line . If you can meet that price , you've got the deal.Otherwise ... __eou__ I'll tell you what , I'll go over the number again with our financial team and see what I can do . I can't give you any guarantees . But we can try . __eou__
We agree to give you a break on the price , all together a discount of 6 % . Good news is , I talked to my boss , he confirmed that if you take care of the shipping costs , we'll throw in insurance . __eou__ Great ! I'd love to get a little better discount than 6 % , but if your company provides the insurance , that will save us a few bucks ... __eou__ Now , all this is available to you , as far as you make payment within a 30 day grace period . That shouldn't be a problem , right ? __eou__ No ... We shouldn't have any problem with that . I know we talked about a possibility for 90 days , but we won't be needing that after your discounted price . __eou__ So , if all this is agreeable to you , I'll put it all down on paper and fax a contract to you this afternoon . If you can get a signed version of the contract we've agreed upon back to me by tomorrow morning , we can go ahead and make arrangements to ship the product on Tuesday . __eou__ Great ! __eou__
I have a sweet tooth . I can not help but think about having something sweet between meals . __eou__ A new candy shop just opened around the corner last week . They have a variety of candies and it is always full of people . __eou__ That sounds really attractive . Let's go to that candy shop now . __eou__ Are you serious ? It is always crowded with many people . __eou__ why not ? I would like to buy some candies . Since there are so many people , I think they must have delicious candy . __eou__ Look at the candy bar over there . It is so colorful and tasty . __eou__ They have lollypops , chocolate drops , fruit candy , mints , pearbrittles and toffee . They are in different colors and flavors . __eou__ I want to get a big bag and buy a little of everything . __eou__ Me too . I finally understand why a small shop like this can always befilmed with dozens of people . __eou__ To be honest , I care only about whether I can have some delicious candy eat . I couldn't care less about whether the shop is popular or not . __eou__ You are a candy terminator . Be careful or you'll get a lot of cavities . __eou__ That is true . Speaking of cavities , I am starting to feel something is wrong with my teeth now . Let's get more strawberry chocolate drops before we go home . __eou__ You really can't live without candy . __eou__
What are you doing there with your mobile phone ? __eou__ I'm moblogging ! __eou__ Moblogging ? what does that mean ? __eou__ Oh , moblogging is a combination of the word ' mobile ' and ' blogging ' . It's another form of blogging . Users can publish blog entries to the web from a mobile phone or other mobile devices . __eou__ Sounds interesting ! That must be very convenient . __eou__ Yes , you're right . I can blog wherever and whenever I'm on the move . It's especially good when I'm on a business trip and my laptop happens to be away from me . __eou__ How can you do that ? __eou__ Well , if I simply want to write a few words , I'll send it by email or edit it all from the cell phone browser . __eou__ What if you want to publish some photos ? __eou__ Then I'll shoot some pictures , re-size the images and upload them with text descriptions to my blog . __eou__ I see . Moblogging must have done a great favor for habitual bloggers like you . __eou__ You bet it ! __eou__
I was surprised to see how few people you have on-site . You provide a wide range of goods and services but have a very small workforce . __eou__ It depends on the time of year . At peak times we hire in casual workers to help with packing and dispatch . We also contract out certain services all year round , for example , cleaning . We run a very tight operation ! __eou__ Do you handle the recruiting yourselves ? __eou__ Sometimes we use a local employment agency . It depends on the job . __eou__
I see by your resume that you have just graduated from college . I assume you haven't had any working experience . Is that right ? __eou__ That's right . I've only had some part-time jobs working in department stores . __eou__ Well , experience is not important in this job . We are looking for a man we can train to be a teller . By the way , do you like to work with figures ? __eou__ Yes , I liked math in school . __eou__ We are more interested in finding someone who is alert and quick at figures . Do you like meeting the public ? __eou__ Yes , I enjoy working with people . __eou__ We have very pleasant working conditions and I think we have a fine staff to work with . You would be assigned an experienced employee to help you . He would be responsible for training you . Have you studied English conversation ? __eou__ Yes , I had an American tutor for two years . I had two lessons under her every week . Would I be using English every day is this job ? __eou__ Yes , many of our customers are Americans , so you would be speaking English with most of them . Do you know anything about various kinds of savings and checking accounts ? __eou__ No , I'm afraid I don't . I'd be glad to learn . __eou__ That's good answer . I appreciate your being frank . __eou__
Thank you . I'm very glad to be here . As Ms . Tina said , the purpose of my presentation today is to familiarize you with the new EBB . As you probably know , EBB stands for Electronic Book Player . Our company put the original EBB on the market a year ago , but we have since all developed an improved model which we believe will be a big seller in both China and the U . S . __eou__ Ms . Yang , can you tell us in what ways the new EBB is better than the old model ? __eou__ Certainly . First of all , the old model had a rather small screen , so not much information could appear at one time . So on the new model , we have made the screen much bigger and ... __eou__ Excuse me , but what are the Mbps mainly used for ? __eou__ Oh , there are many uses and I'll explain them in detail a little later . First , I'd like to ... __eou__ Before you go on , Ms Yang , could you tell us if the original EBB sold well in the U . S . ? __eou__ You were right , Mr . Tim . Your colleagues do want know all about it . __eou__
May I see the manager of your company ? __eou__ I am.What can I do for you ? __eou__ Form your company's advertisement in the TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY , I learn that you are a foreign trade company of good service . I am interested in it.Here is my resume , ma'am . __eou__ Very good , you majored in International Trade ? __eou__ Yes , I will graduate from the People's University of China this July majoring in International Trade.Besides , at school , I am a top student.Moreover , both my spoken and written English are pretty good . __eou__ Well , for this position , we prefer experienced employees , Those who have just graduated from university , they are supposed to start by working as an intern for at least half a year . __eou__ I think I ' m qualified for the job if I can be given the chance.While at school , I once worked as part-time translator in a company and salesperson with a textile company for two years.And I don't mind being paid less from the start , I just want to enrich my experience and competence . __eou__ Good.That is the kind of man we are looking for.By the way , do you like traveling ? Our sales representatives need to travel a lot . __eou__ Yes , I do . I like traveling very much . __eou__ Are you willing to work for extra hours ? __eou__ Of course , I'll try my best.When can I start working ? __eou__ What about next Monday ? __eou__ Great.Let ' s start next week.Thank you , ma'am . __eou__ Well , see you next monday . __eou__
Welcome to the company . We are conducting a survey of new employees to find out what influenced them to choose our company . __eou__ Honestly , the flexible hours were the main attraction for me . The traditional working day doesn't fit in with me lifestyle ; I love being able to tailor my working hours . __eou__ Yes , flextime has definitely been a good change for us . How do you feel about the pay ? __eou__ At first it is going to be difficult . During the first three months , I'm on probation . So I won't get sales commissions until after that . __eou__ But there is a big bonus for employees at the end of the probation period . __eou__ Yes , I'm looking forward to that ! I just hope my first performance review is favorable . __eou__ One thing you can be sure of your manager will be quite fair . If your job performance is up to par , you shouldn't be afraid of a performance review , __eou__ Great ! Then I suppose I'm looking forward to my first promotion , too . __eou__
I have found it quite different here from China since I came to the United States . __eou__ What's the difference ? __eou__ Some friends of mine took me to the mall to go shopping . It was so big . I think I could get lost if I went there alone . __eou__ You must have bought many things in the mall ? __eou__ Not really many . I was told that on weekends there were always the flea markets , so I decided to come to the flea market to buy a bargain . __eou__ It's wise to do it . The Americans have the habit of selling their junk when they are moving to another place , so they usually display all the things they want to sell in their gardens at the weekend . And many things they are selling still look quite new and they are also very useful . __eou__ I have heard about it while in China . it is called a " yard sale " . I didn't have any idea of that until today when I came here to the big " yard sale " . __eou__ You must have got many useful things for your new apartment . __eou__
May's birthday is coming . Shall we buy her a birthday present or let her choose one for herself ? __eou__ I think a surprise party may be better . But I forget when her birthday is . __eou__ You are such a good father . It's next Sunday . __eou__ Sorry . What shall we get for her ? __eou__ What about a cell phone ? She is old enough to have one . __eou__ Good idea . Shall we search on line to find an appropriate one or go to a phone store ? __eou__ Maybe we can try shopping on line . __eou__ Sure . Okay , here is the website . __eou__ I'm sure that May would love the pink one . __eou__ Probably . People's consumptive habit is changing rapidly because of the internet . __eou__ Totally . Computers bring with them convenience.Oh , what's wrong ? __eou__ The computer went frozen . __eou__ Oh , it's such a pain . We'd better go to a store later . __eou__
I hear you are expecting your family . __eou__ Yes , my parents , and soon my brother as well . __eou__ I didn't know you had a brother . __eou__ Oh , yes , he is two years older than me . He lives in New Zealand so I don't see him that often . __eou__ Oh , nice . Is he coming on his own or with the family ? __eou__ His son is coming as well . He wants to go to university here in England so they will visit a few universities while they are here . __eou__ Does your brother have just one son ? __eou__ No , he has two daughters as well . His wife and daughters are visiting her parents . So I won't see them . __eou__ I'm sure your parents are looking forward to seeing their grandson . __eou__ Oh yes , they are really looking forward to it . They went to New Zealand last year and loved it . __eou__ So when are they all coming ? __eou__ My parents are already here . My brother and nephew are arriving on Monday . __eou__
Hello , are you Muriel Douglas ? __eou__ Yes , and you must be James . It's nice to meet you at long last . __eou__ Yes , you too . Thanks for agreeing to meet with us about the new account . My associate , Susan Kim , should be here any minute . Would you like something to drink while we're waiting ? __eou__ No , thanks . I'm fine . Did you have a nice holiday ? __eou__ Yes , I did . My family and I went to Tahoe to ski and the weather was great . How about you ? __eou__ I stayed in L . A . and it was sunny the entire weekend . We spent most of the time at home but we did go see King Kong on Christmas day . __eou__ How did you like it ? __eou__ It was better than I expected . But , you know , I think I would have enjoyed skiing in Tahoe even better . Do you go there often ? __eou__ No , not much . My wife doesn't like to ski . She prefers vacationing where it's warmer , like Hawaii . __eou__ I don't blame her . I really enjoyed it there when we went a few years ago . I'd like to go back sometime soon . __eou__ Yes , me too . Oh , here's Susan now . Let me introduce you . __eou__
Do you remember Tina , my good friend ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ She just broke up with her boyfriend . __eou__ Well , that happens . I hope she is all right . __eou__ But the problem is she and her ex-boyfriend are working in the same department . It is somehow embarrassing for them to see each other everyday . __eou__ That is the down side of an office romance . I hope their work is not affected by the emotional stress . The boss must be very annoyed if that will be the case . __eou__ Well , Tina says she would be able to handle it and concentrate on her own work , easier set them done . But working harder and concentrating only on the job might well helped to overcome the initial stress of the breakup . __eou__
Are these your triplets ? They ’ re beautiful ! I ’ Ve seen other babies who were nothing but skin and bones at their age . You know , they ’ re absolutely identical of you and John ! Are you planning on having any more ? __eou__ Bite your tongue ! I ’ m already at the end of my rope . Some nights I don ’ t sleep at all . John manages to sleep like a log even when the babies are screaming at the top of their lungs . __eou__ Well , tell me . How was the labor and delivery ? __eou__ I wouldn ’ t say that I had the time of my life but at least everything went without a hitch . __eou__ Well , hang in there . In twenty years , you ’ ll fell it was well worth it ! __eou__
Oh , gosh ! I feel everything around me is against me . __eou__ Don't take it too hard . There are some tips you should know in job-hunting of 2010 . __eou__ Well , I am all ears . Maybe they are helpful . __eou__ Firstly , you must always show your best to the interviewer . And secondly , try to avoid spamming through e-mails , because this will make the reader go crazy . The last but not the least , there is no substitute for pounding the pavement in such a digital age . __eou__ I understand what you mean , and I will not upset myself . Face it . __eou__ Good luck to us . __eou__
B , what's in your hand ? __eou__ Sunday papers . I usually read them after coming back home from our company . __eou__ Why do you read them ? __eou__ As you know , I am a sports fan . And these papers are famous for their sports section . So I will feel relaxed after grasping some information I am interested in . __eou__ I got your meaning . Reading is your own solution to solve pressure from busy tasks . __eou__ Correct ! What about you , Fred ? __eou__ I often go to the bar near our dorm when I am overtired . I am crazy for drinking wines with special taste . __eou__ Don't overdo it . __eou__ Shall we have a drink someday ? __eou__ I get drunk easily . __eou__
Is everything ready for the Christmas party ? __eou__ Almost . I ’ Ve put up the decorations , and we ’ Ve decorated the Christmas tree with plenty of tinsel and baubles . __eou__ I like the big star on the top of the tree . I ’ ll put the presents under the tree later , how ’ s the food . __eou__ I ’ Ve prepared most of it already and we ’ Ve got plenty of snack foods-you know , crisps , biscuits , and things . Are you going to make the punch ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ Ve bought all the things to go in it . It won ’ t take long to make . How many people are coming to the party ? __eou__ I think everyone will be coming . Dave don ’ t come because he has to go to his parent ’ s home and they live in Scotland . __eou__ Do we have Christmas pudding ? __eou__ Yes , we do . I hope we have enough for everyone . Did you send out all your Christmas cards in time ? __eou__ Yes , I did . I send most of them a week ago . I ’ Ve brought some with me to the party to give to people in person . __eou__ I did the same . I spent hours yesterday evening wrapping presents . I hope I didn ’ t forget to buy anyone something ! __eou__ I hope you didn ’ t forget mine ! __eou__
Hi , Michelle . Do you need to use the photocopier ? __eou__ Oh , hi Jeremy . No please , go ahead . So how are you , Jeremy ? I was talking to Linda about you only last week . __eou__ Oh , I'm fine , thanks . I'm super busy with work actually . Did you hear about the Lawson contract ? __eou__ No , tell me more . __eou__ Well , I was discussing the contract with Bill and he said that they met the head of Lawsons last week . __eou__ And . __eou__ And hopefully they are going to confirm the deal on Wednesday , fingers crossed . __eou__ That's great news , Jeremy . Congratulations ! Anyway , I must get back , but give my regards to your wife Monica . __eou__ I will , Michelle . Speak to you soon . __eou__
Our Afghan customers wanna buy China's tea . I am thinking of placing an order with you . __eou__ Which tea do you prefer , black or jasmine tea ? __eou__ I like both . Could you show me some samples ? __eou__ Of course , here you are . These are Black tea from Anti , Oolong tea from Guangdong , Oolong tea from Fujisan and Longing tea from Xinu . The new products are Curls Black tea , Crushed Black tea and so on . They are the best sellers in many countries . __eou__ Oh , such a variety . All of them are excellent both in color and flavour . No wonder our people like China ’ s tea better than any other kind . Could you give me some idea of the prices ? __eou__ Here is our price list . All the prices on the list are subject to our final confirmation . You can see the prices are reasonable . __eou__ I'd like you to quote me CIF Karachi . __eou__ Right . Could you tell us the quantity you require so that we can work out the offer ? __eou__ Yes . I want 500 kilograms of Black tea from Anti , 200 kilograms of Jasmine tea from Hangzhou and 100 kilograms of Crushed Black tea , first grade . __eou__ Good . We will make the offer tomorrow afternoon . Is that all right ? __eou__ Yes . See you tomorrow afternoon . __eou__
Okay . This trail looks the best . It's a little steep . But I'm sure it will be alright . __eou__ Well . You're the tour guide , I'll follow you . __eou__ ... What a stink . This place stinks like rotten eggs . __eou__ That's sulphur you can smell . The whole of Taiwan is a volcanic region . That's why Taiwan has so many hot springs . It's volcanic activity.The sulfur smoke that you can smell is coming from those fumaroles over there . __eou__ Suddenly the ' great outdoors ' isn't so appealing . Let's hike a little faster ... __eou__
Our housing problem is a highly complicated issue . __eou__ It is true . I think we should change some policies . __eou__ Right . Like our LPF program . The mortgage size is linked with the amount of savings households have accumulated on their LPF accounts . __eou__ Indeed , it's unfair . Households with higher salaries receive larger LPF contributions and thus qualify for larger loans . Lower-income households , on the other hand , can only get smaller loans , or perhaps nothing if they could not afford to purchase any housing . __eou__ Like you and me ! __eou__
Hit ' em high , hit ' em low . Class of ' 93 — let's go ! __eou__ Hi there , everyone . We hope you're having a good night ! __eou__ Wasn't that football game great ! I just knew we'd win ! __eou__ The night is young , folks . Get some food and mingle with those faces from yesterday . __eou__ Later we'll let you know who the King and Queen of the Reunion will be . __eou__ But for now , the band is playing the songs from our senior year . Get out on that dance floor ! __eou__
David , have you watched the 82nd Oscar Awards Ceremony ? Avatar got the Award of Visual Effect . The movie sounds great ! __eou__ You are so old-fashioned . I have already watched it last week in cinema . __eou__ How was it ? __eou__ Its 3D animation is attractive and its colorful scenes are also unforgettable . __eou__ It is said that The Hurt Locker got the Award of Best Picture . What do you think about this ? __eou__ Well , its theme is moving and profound , so from the academic aspect , this is its advantage to win the award . __eou__
You always stick to your PC recently . Are you still fascinated by chatting on line ? __eou__ For me , the times of chatting online has gone . __eou__ What the hell are you doing now ? __eou__ I opened my blog today . In order to have more visitors , I have to land on others ' blogs and leave my messages for their blogs . __eou__ What's new with you ? __eou__ Do you still remember Justin ? __eou__ Of course , he was our monitor in college . How is him now ? __eou__ He seemed to be dumped by his girlfriend . I found his blogs were a little sad . __eou__ Let me see . What a moving poem ! __eou__
This little wooden stick is called a tee . __eou__ What do you do with it ? __eou__ For the first drive , put the golf ball on the tee , and push the tee into the ground . __eou__ Okay . __eou__ Pick up a wood and hold it like this , interlocking your fingers . __eou__ OK . __eou__ Position yourself , swinging the club , watch the ball and hit it as hard as you can . __eou__ Hey ! __eou__ Not too bad . The goal is to get the ball into the hole with as few hits as possible . __eou__ Got it . __eou__
I enjoy the folk song and dance show very much . __eou__ I'm glad you appreciate our folk music . But a live performance is much more interesting . __eou__ I can't wait anymore . When does the performance start ? __eou__ The show starts at 7 and is over at around 10 o'clock p . m . __eou__ ( After the show ) It's an excellent musical . The acting was very expressive and the songs and dancing were superb . __eou__ I'm glad you enjoyed it . It's had long run , but the house has always been full . __eou__ What do you think of the leading actors ? __eou__ Personally I liked the main character . He was true to type . __eou__ You are a better judge . I don't know the play well enough . __eou__
What kind of packing do you plan to use for this consignment of goods ? __eou__ Cartons . Is that okay ? __eou__ I'm concerned about the possible jolting , squeezing and collision that may take place when these cases are moved about . __eou__ Well , what I can tell you is this . We've got an excellent record on making deliveries to our customers . Besides , all our cartons are lined with shockproof cardboards and are wrapped up with polyethylene sheets . So they're not only shockproof but also dampproof . __eou__ In that case , I guess I can rest assured . __eou__ Well , I guess you can say that . The safety of packing is something we always pay a lot of attention to . Especially for those fragile commodities , we've got to be extra careful . Otherwise , if the things we don't want to see happened , we would be responsible and that'll cause you a lot of inconvenience , too . __eou__ You're right . But wouldn't it be safer to use wooden cases ? __eou__ We sure can if you want us to , but the charge will be much higher . __eou__ It wouldn't be worth the trouble in that case , would it ? Let's still use cartons . __eou__ Sure , no problem . As I said , cartons are good enough for goods like this . You don't have to worry about it . __eou__
Bad news , I'm afraid . Our supplier has gone bust . The parts you ordered have arrived at the docks but the handling agent won't release them until someone pays the invoice . We also need to arrange transport to the factory . __eou__ Don't worry about the cost . Our insurance policy covers us against situations like this . We need those parts urgently . Could you please try to get them here tomorrow ? __eou__
Hi , Mary , you have been a secretary for several years in this company . Could you tell me what a secretary should do for a meeting or a conference ? __eou__ Well , an important part of the duties of a secretary , I think , is to do well the preparation work for the meeting . __eou__ What should a secretary do to prepare for a meeting ? Can you tell me a bit more about it ? __eou__ First of all , the agenda should be prepared before the meeting . Then you should ensure that those entitled to be present are properly informed . __eou__ I see , and how about the documents and the information ? __eou__ All the necessary documents and the information relevant to the meeting should be available , preferably printed and distributed before the meeting . __eou__ And what should a secretary do during the meeting ? __eou__ Of course , she should take minutes . __eou__ And after the meeting ? __eou__ After the meeting she should type the minutes up , and then keep proper records of the business transacted and the resolutions passed and also implement many of the decision reached at the meeting . __eou__ It's seriously good . __eou__
Recycling is big business these days , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it's definitely a growing business . __eou__ What do you recycle in your plant ? __eou__ Mainly plastics . Plastics aren ’ t bio degradable - they don ’ t break down easily in the environment - so they shouldn't be thrown away . __eou__ How is plastic recycled , then ? __eou__ Well , there are basically two methods . One is to break down the chemicals in the plastic into smaller chemical particles . These can then be used in the production of new chemicals . __eou__ Is that the method you use here ? __eou__ No , we don't do that here . We recycle polyethylene and we make it into other products . __eou__ How do you do that ? __eou__ By melting it down and then reforming it . Our main products are bin liners for kitchen bins and carrier bags for supermarkets . __eou__
Do you have a United States R . N . license ( i . e . Registered Nurse license ) ? __eou__ No , I haven't had a chance to take the exam as I have just arrived here . __eou__ Could you tell me about your professional education ? __eou__ B :: All right . I graduated from the nursing school of Beijing Medical University . The nursing school offered such courses as nursing science , nursing psychology , nursing ethics , internal medicine , surgery , pediatrics , and so on . __eou__
hi , Bob , I am so glad that you came . __eou__ of course I'd come . I couldn't think of a better chance to see all my old friends . __eou__ yeah . It's hard to believe that it's been ten years since graduation . It feels just yesterday we collected our diplomas . __eou__ how time flies . But hey , how are things going with you ? __eou__ oh , where to start ? There have been ups and downs . I'm still trying to find my place in this world . It's only recently that I've been able to start settling down . How about you ? You still with Jenn __eou__ yeah , Jenny and I got married right after graduation . It was tough the first years trying to make ends meet . I was supporting us both while she continued her studies . But now things are getting better __eou__ oh , that sounds wonderful . I have always known you two would make it . I hope I can keep in better contact with you guys . I don't want us to drift apart again . __eou__ definitely ! Actually , we just moved into a new place . There's a house-warming party this Saturday , if you are free ? I know Jenny would love to see you again and it should be a good party . __eou__ sounds great ! I'll be there . __eou__
What game do you like ? __eou__ I like board games . I like chinese chess and draughts . __eou__ I ’ Ve never played Chinese chess before , but I ’ Ve seen old men playing it in the street . It looks complicated . __eou__ It ’ s about as complicated as chess . The basic rule and moves are simple enough , but there are many strategies that players need to learn . __eou__ I like playing cards . I ’ m pretty good at poker . Do you play cards ? __eou__ I ’ m terrible at cards and so I never play games which involve gambling , like poker . If I did , I ’ d lose all my money . __eou__ Do you play bridge ? __eou__ Yes , I do . It ’ s hard to find four players though , so I don ’ t play very often . Do you know anyone who plays ? If so , we could set up a game . __eou__ I can play quite well . I have a friend who likes playing , but she ’ s not very good at it . Shall I invite her to play ? __eou__ Sure , I have a friend who play fairly well . We should find out when our friends are free and arrange a game . __eou__ I ’ ll call my friend now . you call yours . __eou__
I've heard that you provide very good service , so when I need a mover , I call you guys first . __eou__ Thanks a lot for calling us . Could you tell me more about what you need us to do ? __eou__ Oh , you see , we are on the 8th floor , and moving into the 6th floor in another building . It is about 15 kilometers to get there . __eou__ OK , the cost depends on the floor to move to , the distance between two places and the amount of the furniture to move . __eou__ How much will it cost in that case ? __eou__ Oh , let me see . It fits the second standard rates . Have a look at the contract , please . __eou__ Your charge is divided into two parts , the Payment in Advance and the rest . I thought that I should pay all of it before moving . __eou__ No , firstly we sign the contract ; you pay 50 % of what it costs , and the rest when we finish moving . __eou__ The damage and compensation item confuses me . Could you give some explanation ? __eou__ OK . If any of the articles was damaged during moving , you may make a claim for compensation with our department . __eou__
Hi , Jack , how have you been ? __eou__ Not very well . __eou__ Why ? Looks like you're feeling very down ! What happened ? __eou__ Nothing . __eou__ Come on . For a man who's feeling so , down , there're usually two reasons . Either his career is going downhill , or he has a broken heart . Since you're so successful , it must be the latter . __eou__ Well , you're right . I just broke up with Jane . __eou__ Oh , I'm sorry . I thought you two were made for each ocher . __eou__ Well , you never know . I'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down , but she says she wants to pursue her career while she's still young . __eou__ Well , she is not to blame . It's always difficult to choose between career and family . __eou__ Maybe you're right . __eou__ Jack , I don't know what to say to comfort you , but cheer up ! There are plenty of fish in the sea and you'll find your soul mate , your perfect match ! __eou__ Yeah , but it's hard to forget her at moment . You know , we were together for almost five years . It's really hard ... __eou__
Will you be joining Billy and I at the Bar ? __eou__ Which one will you be going to ? __eou__ We are going to try the new one that opened up on 17th Street . __eou__ Sure , I've been meaning to visit that place myself . __eou__ I want to stop off at my apartment to get changed so I should be there by 9 pm . __eou__ OK , can I bring a date with me ? __eou__ Certainly . But if there are going to be four of us , I had better make reservations . __eou__ Yes . that is a very good idea . It would be a shame if we could not find a place to sit . __eou__ Then I'II make reservations for 9 pm for a party of four . __eou__ I'll be there . Oh , is there a cover charge at the bar ? __eou__ Not that I know of . Why do you ask ? __eou__ I want to make sure I bring enough money for my date and I . __eou__ I hear the drinks and food there are moderately priced.You should be fine . __eou__ One last question.Is there a dress code there ? __eou__ No , its very casual there . Leave your jacket and tie at home . __eou__ Perfect . I wanted to have a casual evening tonight . __eou__ I'll see you there at 9pm . __eou__ Okay . See you then . __eou__
does your family have a record of your ancestors ? __eou__ sure . My mom has been working on our family tree for years . She ’ s always updating it . __eou__ do you have a copy of your family tree in your house ? I ’ d love to see it . __eou__ I can show it to you now , if you like . I think it goes back about 8 generations so far . __eou__ that ’ s amazing . Do you have a large extended family ? __eou__ I ’ Ve got 30 cousins on my mom ’ s side and 10 cousins on my dad ’ s side . __eou__ are you very close to your first-cousins ? __eou__ the ones that are my age are close relatives . Now that I ’ m older , I don ’ t spend as much time with them as I used to , so I don ’ t know my younger cousins as well as the older ones . __eou__ I see . who ’ s the head of your household ? __eou__ it ’ s definitely my mother . And , her mother is definitely the matriarch of the bigger family . __eou__ that ’ s interesting . What does your grandfather think of your step-mother ? __eou__ at first , she was quite critical of her , but now that they ’ Ve been married for a few years , she ’ s starting to accept the fact that my father divorced my mother . __eou__ that ’ s pretty much how you feel about your step-mother . Like grandmother , like grandson . __eou__
I have a feeling you will get this job . __eou__ Thanks . But I'm not so sure . Interviews stress me out . __eou__ Just remember to be professional and polite . Oh , and don ’ t forget to smile . __eou__ I ’ ll do my best , but sometimes I have trouble being myself in stressful situations . __eou__ Have you updated your resume recently ? __eou__ Yes ... ah ! I forgot to include my e-mail address . __eou__ You ’ d better double-and-triple check it . You don ’ t want to have any embarrassing typos on your resume . Otherwise , you might shoot yourself in the foot . __eou__ I ’ ll be sure and do that . I also need to pick out the right suit , shirt , and tie for this interview . __eou__ Definitely . Oh , do you have a reference letter ? __eou__ Sort of . I prepared a list of all the people who can vouch for my experience and good work ethic . __eou__ I ’ m included on your list of references , right ? My praise of you could really make a difference . __eou__ Sorry , you ’ re not on it . I don ’ t think using my brother as a reference would be very convincing ! __eou__
Hello , Jack . I'm John . __eou__ I'm glad to see you ! __eou__ Sit down , please . Maybe you have read the contract , but I want to give you the details again before you sign the contract . You must have a three-month internship . __eou__ Yes , I know . __eou__ When you become a permanent employee , you will have the insurances . You will get monthly pay and will be on eight-hour / day work shift . __eou__ Wait , will I have five insurances and one fund ? __eou__ Yes . You can also enjoy legal holidays and year-end bonus . __eou__ It sounds great ! __eou__ If you need to work overtime , you will get twice the usual salary as overtime pay . __eou__ OK . __eou__ You have read the relevant terms of the contract . Do you have other questions ? __eou__ How long will the induction training be ? __eou__ About two weeks . __eou__ I see . __eou__ If you don't have other questions , just sign here . __eou__ OK . __eou__
Hey , man , look , what's on the wall over there ? __eou__ Don't you know that ? It's all about new office rules . __eou__ What does it say ? __eou__ It says smoking is not allowed in any private offices . It might be the most terrible thing for you . __eou__ I can smoke outside of the office . But what else does it say ? __eou__ If you want to ask for leave , you should get the approval from the manager in charge of your department . __eou__ But if there is an emergency and the manager is of absence , what should we do ? __eou__ The note says you should call your manager first , and then tell him your reason , and then ask him for the approval . __eou__ OK , OK , got it . By the way , what about the vacation policy ? Anything changed ? __eou__ No . We still enjoy 10 - day of paid vacation per year . __eou__ Can we have 7 - day holiday on National Day ? __eou__ Of course . That's what we deserve . __eou__ That's great ! __eou__ I have something else to remind you of . Don't be late , if you are late , you will be fined 20 Yuan per minute . __eou__ Are you kidding ? I always get up late . Oh , my God . Can't believe that . That is terrible . __eou__ So remember to set your alarm clock . __eou__
At their last meeting , the stockholders voted unanimously to block the merger of our company with Blycore . All the executive committee was in favor of the merger ... I don't understand how the stockholders could have so much power to throw a wrench in the plans ... __eou__ If they all unite on a certain issue , it's the stockholders who have the final say . You'd think it might be our CEO or the workers , but in fact , the stockholders control the money so they have the most power . __eou__ Is it really that simple ? It doesn't seem very efficient to run things that way ... __eou__ It might not be the most efficient , but if you think about it , it makes pretty good sense . The stockholders are our investors . They own the capital in our company , so they should have say about what is done with the company . __eou__ I guess I'd buy that ... __eou__
David , how is your interview ? __eou__ I was nervous at that time . What about you ? __eou__ Just fine . I tried to answer every question raised by HR carefully . I found some answering skills are useful . These questions are different from exams . __eou__ We can have a rest now after this tough interview . __eou__ Don't be rush . It is suggested to write a letter for the Personnel Department of Future Clothes Company . __eou__ Sounds like a good idea . And I think this can leave deep impression to HR . How can we write a suitable letter ? __eou__ Just to show your gratitude to the chance and tell them your impression on the company . And you can mention some details in your own interview to remind them of you . __eou__ I am getting to know your meaning . __eou__
I've just got Bean's new brand image . Let's make a T-shirt line with these pics . __eou__ Are you nuts ? It's the President of the United States in lingerie ! __eou__ Exactly ! With the war in Iraq , they'll sell like crazy around the world . __eou__ What's next ? Tony Blair in high heels ? __eou__ Sure . I'd rather show Bean in a garter belt , but all in good time . __eou__ Inspiration can come in the strangest ways ... __eou__
Now we have settled the terms of payment . Is it possible to effect shipment during September ? __eou__ I don't think we can . __eou__ Then when is the earliest we can expect shipment ? __eou__ By the middle of October , I think . __eou__ That's too late . You see , November is the season for this commodity in our market , and our Customs formalities are rather complicated . __eou__ I understand . __eou__ Besides , the flow through the marketing channels and the red tape involved take at least a couple of weeks . Thus , after shipment it will be four to five weeks altogether before the goods can reach our retailers . The goods must therefore be shipped before October ; otherwise we won't be in time for the selling season . __eou__ But our factories are fully committed for the third quarter . In fact , many of our clients are placing orders for delivery in the fourth quarter . __eou__ Mr . Brown , you certainly realize that the time of delivery is a matter of great importance to us . If we place our goods on the market at a time when all other importers have already sold their goods at profitable prices , we shall lose out . __eou__ I see your point . However , we have done more business this year than any of the previous years . I am very sorry to say that we cannot advance the time of delivery . __eou__ That's too bad , but I sincerely hope you will give our request your special consideration . __eou__ You may take it from me that the last thing we want to do is to disappoint an old customer like you . But the fact remains that our manufacturers have a heavy backlog on their hands . __eou__ But can't you find some way to get round your producers for an earlier delivery ? Make a special effort , please . A timely delivery means a lot to us . __eou__ All right . We'll get in touch with our producers and see what they have to say . __eou__
Can you tell me what's included in your warranty ? __eou__ Certainly . The product has a two-year guarantee . If it breaks down during that period we offer a replacement unit completely free of charge . Our products are very reliable but we recommend you take out an extended warranty . This covers you for a further two years . __eou__ I see . What does that include ? __eou__ It covers all parts and labour , except for normal wear and tear of course . __eou__ What sort of response time do you guarantee ? __eou__ Our engineers are on call 24 hours a day . We guarantee someone will be with you within four hours , but in practice it's often much sooner . __eou__ Are there any exclusions ? __eou__ Not really . It's a very comprehensive warranty . I ’ ll put a copy in the post to you and you can read through the small print . __eou__
Does your country export a lot of natural resources ? __eou__ We export some coal to European countries , but our biggest exports is copper , which we export to Europe , north America , and China . __eou__ Which resources do you have to import ? __eou__ We import a little oil from Venezuela , but we are fairly self-sufficient . We import some iron and a lot of aluminium from neighbouring countries . __eou__ I heard that you country recently discovered deposits of precious stone . __eou__ Yes , that ’ s right . So far , only small deposits have been found . Engineers in my country are focusing on drilling for oil . The government is keen to exploit our natural resources to get money to improve our country . __eou__ If your government invests in your country ’ s infrastructure , it will be money well spent . __eou__ Yes . We need to put the money into long-term projects rather than wasting it on short-term ones . __eou__
Did you hear what happened in the Scott case ? Some of the sensitive material were leaked to the press . Now every newspapers is all over it . __eou__ Oh ... I bet the firm is fuming . Do they know who spilled the beans ? __eou__ I'm sure they have their suspicions ; there were only a few of the senior level layers who were privy to the case details . __eou__ What kind of repercussions will there be for the people who are held responsible ? __eou__ I'm sure there'll be canned ! And there also might be some legal consequences . __eou__ Why would the person who told have problems with the law ? __eou__ Because whoever let the cat out of the bag was breaking client confidentiality . __eou__ I didn't think about that . That's pretty serious . Are there investigators working on finding out who it was ? __eou__ I'm sure management is on top of it . __eou__

The lock is battered to pieces . __eou__ I wonder how the burglar did it . __eou__ He is so unskillful .

I am really exhausted , you know , I have been working without the weekend for two weeks . My boss always asks us to work overtime . __eou__ Does your boss pay you for the over-time work ? __eou__ No . But he provides free meals and sometimes gives us some small gifts . Many of us get very tired of this , and we'd rather have weekends than stay in the office . __eou__ He should know that this is against the Labor Law in our country . Legally , employees should get double pay if asked to do extra work during the weekend or on holidays . __eou__ We all know about that , but we have no choice . The chairman of the trade union says he is going to negotiate with the management . __eou__ I suggest that you go to the lawyers ' office to get some help . __eou__ That's a good idea . I think we will soon come to a solution to the problem . __eou__

I am confused . How could a golfer need so many clubs ?

Did you meet the new girl in our sales department . She is taking the place of Maggie during her alternative leave . __eou__ Did they finally fill that post , how come I haven't seen her ? She must have not been inducted yet . __eou__ I guess not , They haven't officially introduced her to the whole staff yet , she barely started yesterday . __eou__ Is she just working temporarily ? What are they going to do when Maggie comes back from leave . __eou__ If the new girl is competent , maybe they will promote her when that time comes . __eou__
Hello , Doctor . __eou__ Well , What seems to be the trouble , Mr . Williams ? __eou__ It's nothing serious actually , doctor . It ’ s ... Well , I get tired very easily recently , and I often doze off during meetings , office hours and sometimes even while I'm dining . __eou__ How long has this been going on ? __eou__ About two months . I didn't pay much attention to it in the beginning , but you see , I got fired this morning . I dozed off while we were having an important meeting , right in front of the boss . I was very embarrassed . __eou__ How was your appetite ? __eou__ Pretty good , I'd say . __eou__ You haven't lost any weight , have you ? __eou__ No , doctor . I've actually put on two pounds . __eou__ Unbutton your shirt , please . __eou__ Well , doctor ? __eou__ You'll have to have some laboratory examinations to know for sure . __eou__ What examinations ? __eou__ A blood test and during test . You can come back next week , say 4 pm to see the results . __eou__
There have been too many unplanned shutdowns over the past few months . We'll have to make a few changes to the way we operate . We need to reduce our downtime . __eou__ I agree , but the maintenance team is fully stretched dealing with problems . We don't have time to carry out any preventive maintenance . __eou__ We need to establish routine maintenance procedures . It costs us too much in lost production if we wait until something breaks down before we fix it . __eou__
Oh ... I am really worried about the exam . I have no idea what will be on it . __eou__ Why ? Just read your notes.You can see what the professor stressed in the lectures.Probably the exam will ask about things he stressed . __eou__ Yes , but my notes are all nonsense . I can't figure out what is important . __eou__ Let me see them.Are these all the notes you have ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ But Laurie , how can you do well in school if you don't take more notes ? __eou__ What do you mean ? You think I don't write enough . __eou__ I'm sure you don't write enough.Look at this . Here you wrote , Russian Revolution . 1917 . Bolsheviks . Real revolution , or coup ? And that's all ? I remember he lectured for a half hour about that question.And you didn't write any of it ! __eou__ I know , but I listened . __eou__ Yes , but did you remember ? You need good notes to help you remember . __eou__ I suppose you're right . But what can I do ? I don't know what to write down . __eou__ There are different things you can do.For one , the university offers a special free course on note-taking.You should go to the course . Also , I am pretty good at taking notes . I can help you on this exam . I will photocopy all my notes , and you can compare them to your notes.Then maybe you will see what kinds of things to write down . __eou__ That would really help me , Sue . I appreciate it . All this makes me feel like an idiot . __eou__ Don't feel that way . I know you are very smart.Note - taking is a special skill . All students need to learn it.Some people are very smart , but they just haven't learned how to take notes yet . I'm lucky because I had a good English teacher in high school.She taught me how to take good notes . It's not hard . __eou__ Alright . University and high school seem very different to me . I suppose I just need to learn how to manage lecture classes . Then I will do better . __eou__
Hi , Mary , can I have a minute ? __eou__ Sure , what's up ? __eou__ Well , actually I want to tell you that I've put in notice . __eou__ Really ? Why ? __eou__ Many reasons . I've been here for too long . Next year will be my five-year anniversary . I want a change of setting . Besides , our company is downsizing . I don't want to stay on just to be let go . __eou__ But they wouldn't lay you off ! You are the most experienced project manager in the company . __eou__ Maybe . But that's not kept the new boss from breathing down my neck . To be honest , I've got a better offer from another company . __eou__ Oh that's great , congratulations ! What's your new position ? __eou__ Senior director of market research . In addition to a nice pay rise it has some nice perks , like a company car , one month paid vacation , and an apartment downtown . And it's an international company so I'll have lots of chances to travel and meet new people . I'm really looking forward to it . __eou__ Sounds a great opportunity . I bet that made the decision to leave a lot easier . __eou__ Indeed . But let's stay in touch . I'll let you know how things go . __eou__ Sure . __eou__
There is a wonderful opera today . I'd like to see it . __eou__ I do not like the play with complicated plot . What's on today ? __eou__ ' The sound of music ' . This music is known by everybody and is suitable for all ages . It is about a happy family without sex , violence or bad language . __eou__ I know that . I have seen the film as the same title . Andrews gives a performance to be remembered for a lifetime from Maria to a cheerful governess . __eou__ Yes , you are right . I like the song in the movie , edelweiss , do you remember it ? __eou__ Of course , it is a nice song that can make audience calm and pleasant . __eou__ Those young actors play the roles perfectly . __eou__ I hope the opera will be more stupendous than the movie . Have you bought the tickets ? __eou__ No , I am asking you whether you will go to see it . __eou__ Let's go . We'd better buy the tickets earlier and have dinner in restaurant . __eou__
Hello . Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I hope so . I would like to register for Comp Lit 287 . __eou__ I'm sorry , but that class is already full.And also , students are supposed to register through the touch-tone registration system . __eou__ I know . I already tried to register for it by phone , but the computer won't let me . __eou__ That's because it's full . __eou__ But I'm a new student here . I thought maybe there was some way I could get into the class . I thought I should come and talk to you in the department office . __eou__ Well , I could put you on a waiting list.But that doesn't guarantee you will get into the class . What is your name ? __eou__ My name is Karen Huang . That's spelled H - U - A - N - G . __eou__ Alright . And what is your major ? __eou__ I'm a comparative literature major . __eou__ Wait a minute . You're a Comp Lit major ? __eou__ Yes , that's right . __eou__ Why didn't you tell me ? I didn't know you were one of our students . __eou__ That's why I'm trying to get into Comp Lit 287 . I know it's a required class.And Professor Cohen told me I need to take it . __eou__ The university computer system saves extra places , in class 287 for comp lit students . I can give you a special code.When you register by phone , you can use the code to get into the class . __eou__ Even if the class is full ? __eou__ That's right . __eou__ Oh , I didn't know that . __eou__ Sure . Here is the code number , with information on how to use it . __eou__ Thank you . So you think I will be able to get in with this ? __eou__ Sure . Just call the touch-tone registration system again.Then , follow the directions on the sheet . You will get in no problem . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ Next time you come in here , I will recognize you . __eou__
I wanna register for this mathematics course . __eou__ I ’ m sorry registration has closed . __eou__ Closed ? The clerk told me I could come back and register any time during the first week of classes . __eou__ Well , that ’ s not possible . The computer ’ s official student account has already been sent to the state . And that ’ s what our budget is based on . Who told you that anyway ? __eou__ Some woman in here when I tried to register three weeks ago . She said I just had to pay a late fee . __eou__ She must have been a part-time worker . They didn ’ t have much training . Why didn ’ t you register then ? __eou__ She said I couldn ’ t until I had my birth certificate . Here it is . __eou__ Huh , that is no reason to demand a birth certificate . We only need to establish residency , you know , a phone bill with your name and address on it would have been fine . __eou__ Serious ? Only the proof of my address . __eou__ Yes , I am afraid she gave you the wrong information . __eou__ But it ’ s unfair . __eou__ Well , I sympathize with your problem , but , to be honest , I don ’ t think there is any thing anyone can do for you . You were trapped in the system.If you want , you can talk to the director . She will help you if she can . __eou__ Great . __eou__ Don ’ t get your hopes up . __eou__
How should we commemorate the centenary of the founding of the university ? We have been given quite a large budget to pay for some events . __eou__ We should certainly hold a big party for the professors and students . We could have a firework display . __eou__ Do you think that we should invite alumni and former professors ? __eou__ If we do , too many people might attend . Perhaps we should invited all of them , but make a small charge to attend . __eou__ Good idea . We should also hold a series of presentations . We could have presentations on the history of the university , the courses we offer , and our links with other universities . __eou__ Good idea ! I think we could also have presentations by former students on how their experience here helped them in their lives . __eou__ We could have another on the successes of graduates from here . __eou__ I think that we could also produce some merchandise for the centenary-you know , T-shirts , mugs , plates , pens , and things like that . __eou__ That ’ s an excellent idea . Hopefully , we would be able to make a profit ! A few professors and students are writing a book on the history of the university . __eou__ I ’ m looking forward to reading that . We could have book signings by famous professors an alumni . __eou__ A group of students from the art and music faculty are producing a short film . __eou__ I ’ m sure that will be very popular .. OK , let ’ s think about how we can put these ideas into practice . __eou__
I've been so stressed these days . __eou__ What's the matter ? Are you OK ? __eou__ I don't know where to go for college , and what to major in . __eou__ Don't worry . You have plenty of time to decide . __eou__ And I also want to get scholarships to help me pay for the tuition . I want to get the burden off my family . __eou__ You always worry too much about everything . Take it easy , honey . You are good enough . You can go to the ideal college . __eou__ OK , OK . I'm so sorry . By the way , for you , is it more important to make money or to enjoy your work ? __eou__ In a perfect world , I would enjoy my work if I do not have to do much , and make lots of money ! __eou__ OK , honey , stop dreaming . You should face the reality . __eou__ That's only a joke . To be honest , I have to improve my English , because my English is not good enough . I still get confused about some simple grammars . Since you are quite good at it , do you have any suggestions ? __eou__ En , first you should be concentrated on what the teacher said in class . Second , I suggest you to take an additional course in some training center . __eou__ Is the training center helpful ? __eou__ I think so . Because I've taken one to improve my oral English during summer vacation . __eou__
Morning , Peter . Nice suit ! A new one ? __eou__ Oh , yes . My wife bought it for me yesterday . Hmm , you look nice in that yellow dress . Yellow suits you really well . __eou__ Maybe . Several people have suggested that I get more yellow clothes . They say the color suits me because I have a fair complexion . __eou__ That's right . You know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . Actually , I think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . It's just that different colors can give people different impressions . For example , black could make you look mature , while pink could make you look young and energetic . __eou__ Thank you for your compliments . It sounds like you're a clothing expert . __eou__ Well , compared with my wife , I'm just a beginner . __eou__
What a lovely day . The sun is shinning and the sky is so blue . It's a perfect day to go to the beach and get a beautiful tan . __eou__ Great idea . Unlike you , I just want to enjoy watching the sea and playing with the sand . I do not want to get a tan because I look good in pale skin . __eou__ Come on . Getting a tan symbolizes health and wealth in western countries . __eou__ While the pale color symbolizes beauty and elegance in most Asia countries . __eou__ That is a really interesting fact . __eou__ I will bring a big hat and apply a lot of sunscreen before setting off the beach . __eou__ Just do whatever you feel like doing . __eou__ ( At the beach ) My bag is so heavy . Let's put the stuff under the tree . __eou__ Good idea . It is always cooler in a shade . __eou__ I can't wait to play in the water . My feet are burning when I stand on the sand . __eou__
Have you seen this ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ They killed another hostage . __eou__ Oh , how awful . What a terrible thing to do . __eou__ I agree completely . I just don't understand what's wrong with them . Don't they have any humanity ? __eou__ Well , maybe they've got a point . I mean , I suspect that they think the same about us . __eou__ Yes , but that doesn't make them right , does it ? Just because they think so ? __eou__ I guess not . My view is that we should give in to their demands , so that innocent people can stop getting killed . __eou__ Come on , you can't be serious ! We should never give in to terrorist's demands , otherwise where would we be ? __eou__ Well , that's probably true , but I don't think we should be dogmatic about it . A colleague of mine was kidnapped once , so perhaps I have a different view of things . __eou__ Really ? What happened ? __eou__ Well , it was in the Balkans during the war . He was only held for three days , and then they simply released him . It was a case of mistaken identity , and they just let him go when they found out he was no use to them . It was lucky they didn't kill him . __eou__ Oh , sure . __eou__
I think you're being a little naive . __eou__ If I want , I can protect myself by paying through an escrow account , which holds the money until I receive the item . __eou__ That proves my point ! Protect yourself or you'll get burned . __eou__ eBay also offers free insurance . You can get a refund of up to $ 200 if you're not satisfied with your purchase . __eou__ $ 200 ? If they get a hold of your credit card number , you're going to be out a lot more than $ 200 ! I had a friend who ... __eou__
Hi , Robert . What happened to your face ? It looks swollen . __eou__ I had to go get a cavity filled today . __eou__ Did it hurt ? __eou__ I don't even wanna talk about it . It killed me ! __eou__ How long were you in the chair ? __eou__ It took quite a while , but the worst part was getting numbed . They had to give me 3 shoots . __eou__ Well , I guess you've learned a good lesson , huh . You have to take good care of your teeth . __eou__ No kidding . Not only can ’ t I stand the pain , but man ... dentists are expensive . The bill is going to be humungous ! __eou__ Don't you have a dental insurance ? __eou__ I do , but it still does not cover everything . __eou__
what are you watching on the telly ? __eou__ there's a great sitcom on Channel 3 that stars in about three minutes . __eou__ which one is that ? __eou__ the office . Have you watched it ? __eou__ I've seen the British version and loved it , but have never seen the American version . __eou__ it's almost exactly the same . I think it's a hilarious show . __eou__ what are you watching now ? __eou__ they're just showing highlights of American Idol from last night right now . __eou__ I can't stand American Idol ! I think it's really over-rated . __eou__ I couldn't agree with you more . __eou__ have you got satellite , cable , or digital TV ? __eou__ we have digital TV . It's amazing though---even with 100 channels , there's often nothing on that I'd want to watch ! __eou__ do you watch a lot of TV then ? __eou__ I guess so . I'm bit of a couch potato . How about you ? __eou__ I don't have a TV at home , so I rarely watch anything . Is there anything worth watching after the office ? __eou__ there's actually a documentary on the history channel later on that I'd like to watch . Do you want to stay and watch it with me ? __eou__ why not ? I don't have anything better to do ! __eou__
I'd like to have a couple of complete sets of paper money and coins . __eou__ Yeah . You can take them home and either use them as a gift or keep them as mementoes . __eou__ Ah , where can I find old paper money and coins used before and after 1949 ? __eou__ I'd suggest that you go to the Philately Store in Nanjing Road East , where the items are authentic and the prices are reasonable . __eou__ Good . Sorry to have troubled you so much , Miss . __eou__ You're always welcome . Anything else can I do for you , sir ? __eou__ No , thanks . I did not notice it has been dark outside .

How could we advertise our celebrations to mark the centenary of the founding of the university ? __eou__ I ’ m sure we could get one or two tv companies to come in . Perhaps the president could invite them and do an interview . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . We could put up some posters in and around the campus with a list of events . It would be quite cheap to do on the campus . __eou__ It will be expensive to do outside the campus . Perhaps we could arrange for some sponsorship . __eou__ We could contact alumni who work for large , well-know companies . They might be able to arrange cheap advertising in exchange for some free tickets . __eou__ Good thinking ! We should also print some leaflets for students to distribute . __eou__ We should put some information about it on the home page of our university website . When people visit the website , they ’ ll see the information . __eou__ We could take out some advertisements to local newspapers . I checked the prices and they are reasonable . __eou__ Ok .

Mr . Bryant ? Hi , I'm Mike from Florence Incorporated . I'll glad you made it okay . How was your flight ? __eou__ It was pretty bumpy , also a bit long , all together about 5 hours . __eou__ That is a long flight . You had a layover too , is that right ? You must be tired . __eou__ Actually I feel quite rested . I was able to sleep on the plane . __eou__ Good ! Here , let me help you with your bag . Is it your first time to Seattle ? I'd be happy to take you around this city and show you the sights tonight if you're up to it . __eou__ That will be very nice .

I ’ m thinking about getting a pet , but I ’ m really not sure which animal would be suitable . Could you give me some advice ? __eou__ Certainly ! The first thing is to be honest about how much time for you can devote to your pet . Dogs are very demanding . You need to take them for walks and they love to play . Cats , on the other hand , are more independent . __eou__ I ’ m fairly busy , so I really need an animal that I don ’ t need to care of very much . Actually , I ’ d like a pet that ’ s a little unusual . I don't ’ really want a typical pet , like a cat , dog , or hamster . Do you have any suggestions ? __eou__ Unusual pet are often more expensive to keep . Is that a problem ? __eou__ Not really . By the way , I don ’ t want a pet that could be dangerous , like a tarantula or rattlesnake . __eou__ We have those , but I only sell them to people I know well , for obvious reasons . How about a lizard ? I have some that are very brightly coloured , are not aggressive , and are easy to feed and look after . __eou__ That sounds ideal . Could you show me some ? __eou__ Sure . Come over here . As you can see , I have a wide selection of species . They can live together , if you want lizards of different kinds . Do you have a favourite colour ? __eou__ I like the red one . What do they eat ? __eou__ You can feed them on various things . They will eat small pieces of meat , but I ’ d recommend insects . You can get them from your garden , but remember that lizards eat a lot insects . I sell them here . __eou__ Thanks a lot . What I ’ ll do si find out more online and drop by next week . __eou__ That ’ s fine . You shouldn ’ t make a hasty decision when choosing a pet . __eou__
Hi , Dan . What's new ? __eou__ Where have you been ? I've been trying to get in touch with you for two days . __eou__ I went to Salt Lake City on business . What's up ? __eou__ I got fired . __eou__ How come ? Last time I saw you . You told me it was a good job , and you'd like to take it as a career . That was only one month ago . Why this sudden change ? __eou__ It's a long story . In a word , I didn't do a good job of it . I messed up a business deal , a deal that would have made ten million dollars and I messed it up . __eou__ What are you going to do now ? __eou__ I am trying to find a job asap . Lily doesn't know yet . I didn't tell her . I spent the past three days at the coffee shop next to your office , and she thought I went to work as usual . __eou__ That's not the way to solve the problem . Did you look in the classified advertisements column ? __eou__ Yes , I did . But I wasn't qualified for most of the jobs that I was interested in . __eou__ Listen . I will see what I can do , ok ? You go home and tell Lily about this problem you have now . She is your wife and I am sure she will understand . __eou__ I just don't know how to bring it up . Well , all right . She has the right to know anyways . __eou__

Look at this newspaper article about this famous local medium . It says that she is really gifted and so popular now , that she is booked solid with appointments for the next twelve months ! __eou__ You don't really believe in all that hocus pocus mumbo jumbo , do you ? __eou__ Well , I have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their palms read and most of the things the psychic told her came true ! __eou__ Of course it does ! They tell you general and obvious things like that you will be successful or have a big house . I think most of the times they are just scam artists . __eou__ Well , historically it is a practice that many cultures share . Reading the tarot cards , in the east they would even read tea leaves ! I even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar , and then read your ashes . __eou__ All superstitious nonsense ! I would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say , just for kicks . __eou__
Good morning , Mr.Black . I am the new secretary . __eou__ Good morning , Miss White . You are half an hour early . __eou__ I don't want to make a bad impression . __eou__ Come on over . This is your desk , and this is your time card . Be sure to clock in and out before and after you work . __eou__ I will . __eou__ One more thing , keep your desk neat . It's the rule . There is no exception , even the art designers have to keep their desks neat . __eou__ I'll keep that in mind . Does everything on the desk belong to me ? __eou__ Not belong . You can use them as long as you work here . When you quit , you ’ ll have to return them to the company . __eou__ What's the extension number for my phone ? __eou__ The operator will put all your calls through . You don't have to worry about that . __eou__ Can I make personal phone calls during my office hours ? __eou__ Of course you can .

May I help you at all ? __eou__ Yes , please . My son wants to go overseas , to England , to do his Master degree . I wondered if you offer any kind of loan that could assist him in doing so ? __eou__ We certainly do . I can give you some details about a loan called Personal Loan for Studying Abroad . We offer this to anyone who will study outside this country . __eou__ I see . What does it entail ? I'm not sure if we will be eligible . __eou__ This loan is specially provided for people who are studying overseas to pay for their tuition fee and other sundry items . __eou__ So , we could use it to pay for my son's living expenses , not just his tuition ? __eou__ That's right . The sundries could include accommodation , text books and so on . The guidelines are not so strict , you see . __eou__ That is good to know . Just think ! We've been worrying about this for weeks and just a short visit here and my mind is at ease . Thank you . __eou__
Excuse me , is this the Auto Consumer Loan Center ? __eou__ Yes . Is there anything I can do for you ? __eou__ Could you tell me something about the terms and interest rates for personal automobile consumer loan ? __eou__ The deadline is normally no more than 5 years with the interest adopted according to the corresponding lending rates announced by the PBC . __eou__ I plan to take the loan for 3 years . __eou__ Well , the yearly interest rate is 5.49 % for 3 years . I'm sure you are qualified to apply for this loan . __eou__ What about the loan repayment ? __eou__ You may choose a repayment pattern by consulting with our bank , for example , payment of equal amount of principal or of principal and interest on monthly installments . __eou__ Does that mean I should deposit sufficient money to my account prior to the monthly payment date so that you can directly deduct the repayment of the principal and interest ? __eou__ Exactly . You are permitted to effect and early payment in part or in full with the consent of our bank . __eou__ That's very thoughtful of you . Thank you so much . __eou__ You're welcome . __eou__
Nowadays fewer and fewer people go to the movie theaters to see films . So I am afraid that the film studios are really getting hard time to survive . __eou__ What you said is true . But the film producers there are more flexible ways to get more audience . For example , to make more movie Ccds , so people will spend money buying them . __eou__ But it is true that cinemas are losing the attraction they used to have in the past . __eou__ Yes . Take myself for example . I seldom go to cinemas , but it doesn't mean I no longer see films ; instead , I see films at home-watching Ccds . __eou__
Have you followed the value of dollar lately ? __eou__ How could I help but follow it ? The fluctuation of dollar is killing my company ! The exchange rates are eating into our profits , and we can't do anything about it . __eou__ It's really frustrating , isn't it ? I have the same problem . I would feel a lot better if the currency was a little more stable . With the way the dollar plummeting lately , my securities have gone up in smoke . __eou__ Every day I have less money ! I haven't spent anything , it is just melting away because of the shifts in exchange rate . __eou__ What we really should be making investment in is the Euro . I've followed the Euro's progress over the last quarter , I think it's about time to buy in . __eou__ What about the Yen ? __eou__ Are you kidding ? The Yen is in worse shape than the Dollar ! __eou__
Where are you going for your holidays , Charles ? __eou__ To Australia . I'm going to visit my uncle in Brisbane for three weeks . __eou__ Good gracious ! You certainly are lucky . How are you going there ? __eou__ By air , of course . It takes over two weeks to go by sea . __eou__ I once went to Singapore by air . It was very exciting-but never again . __eou__ Why ? Did you feel frightened ? __eou__ For a short time . One of the engines caught fire . __eou__ What did the pilot do ? __eou__ He put it out and flew back to the airport . Then he asked the people at the airport where the emergency runway was . __eou__ Did you land safely ? __eou__ Yes , we did . But I shall never fly again . __eou__
Susan , can you tell me in a nutshell what the retail market is like in China ? __eou__ Well , as per capital income goes up and up , the growth sector seems to be in the high-end . __eou__ Retail is going upscale here ? China is certainly growing more quickly than I had imagined . __eou__ Yes . Things certainly have changed since I was a boy . We've developed very quickly . __eou__ Do you think the trend will continue ? __eou__ I don't see why not . We do have some problems , but we are still willing to work hard and wages aren't too high at this point . __eou__ Everything I've seen so far is very impressive , very impressive indeed . __eou__
Next is a ballet performance , but who is the dancer ? __eou__ I'd swear that's Eddy from circulation . __eou__ Since when did Eddy start doing ballet ? ! __eou__ Not very long from the looks of it ! __eou__ Look ! He has a partner ! __eou__ He's dancing with Jack ! __eou__ Gross ! __eou__ The wei-ya is the one time a year you can make fun of the boss . __eou__ But I think Eddy is going too far ! __eou__ You're right . They are spinning pretty fast . Aren't they getting dizzy ? What if they fall ... __eou__ Oh ! Ouch ! That must've hurt ! __eou__ How embarrassing ! __eou__

There are several models you may want to look at.This Kreng portable cassette player is very good . __eou__ Kreng ? I've never heard of that company . __eou__ It's a German company.This unit has auto-reverse , recording capability , and an AM / FM radio band.It also has a built-in microphone . __eou__ I suppose I don't want that one then . I don't like auto-reverse . It breaks too easily . __eou__ Really ? Have you had an auto-reverse break before ? __eou__ Yes , twice now . I think it's too high-tech , and so it's the first part that breaks . __eou__ Hmm . You know , the problem might be dust . Did you clean the unit often ? __eou__ Well . No , I didn't clean it.But still , I only had the last one two months , and it broke . I don't trust auto-reverse . __eou__ Alright . Well . We have many units without auto-reverse.Here is a good unit . Very reliable.It has an AM / FM band , built-in microphone , recording capability , and no auto-reverse . __eou__ How much is it ? __eou__ This one sells for $ 39.99 . __eou__ Can I test it out ? __eou__ Of course . __eou__ It sounds great . I'll take it . __eou__ Fine . I think you'll be happy with it . It's a very good unit . Very reliable . I'll go get you a new one in a box . I will be back in just a moment . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__
We've been cramming for tomorrow's history exam since early this morning . What do you say we take a break and listen to some music , okay ? __eou__ Now that you mention it , I'm getting a little bumed-out from studying nonstop , too . Listening to some music for a while would suit me just fine . __eou__ While you're picking out a record to play , I'll grab a couple of beers out of the refrigerator . __eou__ You sure have a lot of discs here . __eou__ Yeah , I've got everything from rock n ' roll to the latest new - wave stuff . __eou__ To tell you the truth , I'm strictly into classical music . You don't happen to have any Bach or Mozart , do you ? __eou__ Sorry , my taste in music doesn't go back any further than the 1960 ' s . Music written before then is just history to me . __eou__ Well , speaking of history , let's get back to the books.We ' Ve got an exam tomorrow , remember ? __eou__
Are you ok , Chuck ? You look pale . __eou__ I'm fine , Katherine . I just stayed up late last night working on my Chinese . __eou__ Oh , poor you . You know what ? I found a new way to learn Chinese and it works very well . __eou__ You did ? Do tell me . I've spent all these months trying to learn something new about it , but I've made little progress ! __eou__ Sure . I'm learning Chinese through songs . __eou__ So you're learning Chinese songs ? __eou__ You can say that . I can actually sing some of them now . __eou__ That's a real achievement . How did you do that ? __eou__ I start by listening to the song a few times and after several times I am able to follow the singer . __eou__ It makes sense . __eou__ It does . I've learned some Chinese folk songs this way . They are clearly presented and easy to follow . __eou__ Can Join you , Katherine ? I do want to have a try . __eou__ Why not ? I downloaded a beautiful song the other day . We can learn it together now . __eou__ Great . Do you think we need a Chinese dictionary ? __eou__ Yes , just in case we run into me new characters . __eou__ Ok . I will bring it with me . __eou__
Let's have seafood tonight and then go see the new movie at Mall Cinema.Betsy told me it's a beautiful love story and I shouldn't miss it . __eou__ Oh , Goodness , please not again.That ' s what we did last week . __eou__ No , we didn't . Last week we went to see that movie about a man's struggle against mental illness . __eou__ Right , it was a chick flick , just like this one , so what's the difference ? Besides , this is the last week for the third movie in Destroyer series and I want to see that on a big screen . Action movies need to be seen in a theater on a big screen . __eou__ Oh , yeah , and I did promise to see it with you if we went to that movie last week.But you liked that movie , didn't you ? __eou__ Oh , sure , it was great . I had popcorn for dinner and paid the price of a movie ticket to get a two-hour nap . __eou__ It wasn't that bad , and you're the one that insisted on skipping dinner.We went to an excellent restaurant . __eou__ That place doesn't have a single meat dish.Just fish and shellfish and you know I don't like fish that much . __eou__ And I don't like meat that much.The only meat I eat is chicken . __eou__ But when I pick the restaurant , we go to a place that has both chicken and fish . I always respect your food preferences . __eou__ Well , I suppose that , to be fair , you should get to pick the movie and we can go to a restaurant that serves meat . __eou__ Now you're talking , we can see that love story next time . __eou__

Second , you stood me up on the Valentine's Day . __eou__ I'm very sorry for that , but I sent you several messages to explain , my mom was seriously ill , and I had to look afer her . __eou__ But I ended up with finding out lady that night , that you were with other girl at cafe near your home . __eou__ That girl was my cousin . __eou__ You've got so many cousins . I called you later that night . But you didn't have the guts to answer the phone . __eou__ I didn't take my cellphone with me at that time . __eou__ I don't buy a story . __eou__ I know you don't hear me right know , please calm down . Anyway , I don't wanna part . I'll drop by tomorrow . __eou__ No , don't , I don't want to see you anymore . Don't ever call me again . __eou__

Hello , this is IBA Bank . Maria speaking , how may I help ? __eou__ Hi , I'm looking into your loans and I'm a little confused about the interest rates . Could you give me some advice ? __eou__ Not a problem . Which loan was it you were interested in ? Sorry , I must ask , because the interest rates can depend on the type of loan you apply for . __eou__ I understand . I'm interested in the Petty Consumer Loan . __eou__ One of our most popular ! The usual interest rate is fixed by the PBC . That is The People's Bank of China . But of course , with some loans , credit rating and loan amount come into play , too . __eou__ So , the rate could fluctuate a little , depending on the amount given by the PBC ? __eou__ That is correct . __eou__ I'm going to have to do some more research into this . Thanks for your help , bye for now . __eou__
Will you look at this form ? __eou__ Are you having problems with it ? __eou__ I don't understand some things . __eou__ Let me help you . __eou__ What does MI mean ? __eou__ MI stands for Middle Initial . __eou__ What does MM / DD / YY mean ? __eou__ That means Month / Day / Year .

Julia , Julia , Julia . My daring Julia , what's wrong with you ? __eou__ Steven , are you talking to me ? __eou__ Yes , I have called you three times . What makes you in a daze ? __eou__ I was thinking about the accident I saw in the morning . I was petrified when two cars collided . I witnessed the traffic accident . __eou__ Did someone get hurt ? __eou__ A driver died instantly . The other one was badly hurt . A poor boy called Peter was killed in the accident too . __eou__ What a terrible accident ! Who should be responsible for this traffic accident ? __eou__ I think both . They drove too fast . What's worse , one of them was drunk . __eou__ Why do some guys like to drive so fast when they are drunk ? __eou__ I don ’ t understand . Maybe they feel they are okay and driving fast seems very cool . __eou__
I'm glad we came here . This is really delicious ! __eou__ I was worried you would think it was too far to drive . __eou__ Well , it's true I've never driven two hours just to get lunch.But really , I think it's worth it . __eou__ I think if you try some more authentic Chinese food , you might understand how we students from Taiwan suffer . __eou__ How do you mean " suffer " ? __eou__ I mean , in Milwaukee there is no good Chinese food.So we miss the food in Taiwan too much.Sometimes we just have to drive down here to Chicago to find something better . __eou__ Even in the winter ? __eou__ Yes , even in the winter . __eou__ And even if it takes two hours , huh ? __eou__ Why not ? I've been craving good food for three weeks now . I'm too sick of hamburgers and pizza ! __eou__ Well , this really is delicious , I have to admit . I can understand better now why you and your friends are always whining . __eou__ Don't tease me ! Good food is really important to Chinese ! __eou__ I know . I can see that . This is what is called " dim sum , " right ? __eou__ Yes , all these dishes are different " dim sum " dishes.You can't find this kind of thing except for in a few cities in America . __eou__ So when you Chinese think of Chinatown , you mostly think of food . Is that right ? __eou__ Of course . I will try to buy some things at the Asian grocery down the block too.Then I can do a little cooking in my apartment . __eou__ And maybe we can go to a good Italian restaurant for dinner , after the museum.Chicago has some great Italian restaurants . __eou__ No way ! __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ We're going up to the " new " Chinatown for dinner . I already know where we're going to go . __eou__ Alright , alright . I am happy to try more Chinese food.Will it be dim sum again ? __eou__ No , dim sum is usually eaten around lunch time , or sometimes closer to breakfast.We ' ll try more Taiwanese style up at the " new " Chinatown . __eou__ Taiwanese style ? Isn't dim sum Taiwanese style ? __eou__ No , dim sum is more Cantonese style.But of course you can buy it in Taiwan . __eou__ I wonder if you can cook things this good . __eou__ I'm a great cook actually . You will see . __eou__
You'll soon graduate from your university . Do you have any plans for the future ? __eou__ I'm planning to go to graduate school , but I also want to find a job .

I'm not sure . __eou__ what kind of job do you want after graduation ? __eou__ I want to become a professor , a lawyer , an editor , a civil servant ... __eou__ wait ! You can't do so many things at the same time . What exactly do you want ? __eou__ I don't know . Do you have any advice for me ? __eou__ yeah , you should first decide what kind of career you really want , plan your career path , and then try your best to achieve your goal . __eou__ I think perhaps I need to buy a few years while I figure out about my career . __eou__ no , you can't waste your time wandering around . If you want a job that requires a higher degree or diploma , you should focus on your graduate school entrance exam ; if you want a job that needs working __eou__ thank you so much for your advice . I'll think it over . __eou__
excuse me ; is this seat taken ? __eou__ no . It's all yours . __eou__ thank you very much . My name is Ashlan . It's nice to meet you . __eou__ Carson . It's nice to mee you , too . __eou__ the weather is so warm for December , don't you think ? __eou__ it is unusually warm . I blame it on global warming . __eou__ global warming is wreaking havoc everywhere . __eou__ so sure . Are you from around here ? __eou__ no . I'm new here . I just moved here a few months ago . __eou__ where are you from ? __eou__ I'm from China . What about you ? __eou__ I am from Texas . I was in China once , but it was a long time ago . __eou__ did you enjoy it ? __eou__ I did . I especially liked the food . What do you think about the food here ? __eou__ it's very different from Chinese food , but I am getting used to it . __eou__ Is that the Da Vinci Code that you've got there ? __eou__ yes , have you read it ? __eou__ no , but I saw the movie . What do you think about it ? __eou__ well , to be honest , I've only gotten though 10 pages of it . So far , though , it's interesting . __eou__ well , this is my stop . it was nice talking with you . __eou__ likewise . Bye ! __eou__
This Olympic park is so big ! __eou__ Yes . Now we are in the Olympic stadium , the center of this park . __eou__ Splendid ! When is it gonna be finished ? __eou__ The whole stadium is to be finished this June . __eou__ How many seats are there in the stand ? __eou__ Oh , there are 5000 seats in total . __eou__ I didn ’ t know it would be so big ! __eou__ It is ! Look there , those are the tracks . And the jumping pit is over there . __eou__ Ah ... I see . Hey , look the sign here , No climbing . __eou__ We put many signs with English translations for foreign visitors . __eou__
I've been waiting here in the conference room for ten minutes already . What time does our meeting start ? Where is everyone anyway ? __eou__ Didn't you hear about that ? Our meeting was proponed until Friday . __eou__ What ? The meeting was proponed ? No one told me anything about it . __eou__ Didn't you get the memo ? __eou__ What memo ? There haven't been any memos this whole week . I check my unbox every day , and I haven't seen anything . __eou__ The memo went out three days ago . It should have made it to your in-box , but maybe it got lost in all the clutter on your desk . __eou__ You know how things get piled up on my desk when I am busy — I know that sometimes I do misplace things , but I always read all the memos that go around . They go directly to my in-box . Are you sure it was sent to the whole office ? __eou__ It should have gone around to everybody . They also posted a copy of the memo in the break-room . Don't you ever look at the messages posted on the bulletin board ? __eou__ I'm usually too busy to take a bunch of coffee breaks and gossip by the water cooler . Anyway , I am sure the memo never got to my in-box . I'll have to talk to our secretary about it . __eou__ That's right . You never know what you're missing out if you don't read the memos . __eou__
Last month , we only had 40 hits on our site . Our products and prices are good , but the problem is that no one knows about our website . __eou__ If we want to get this internet business off the ground , we've got to do something fast . __eou__ We need to maximize the chances that our site will be at the top of search engine lists , but I'm not sure how to do it . __eou__ We've got to put more buzz words into the page text , so it will pop up when people search about our kind of products . __eou__ Yeah , you're right . We've got to get the most popular phrases there ... How else can we boost site traffic ? __eou__ I think one of the least costly ways to attract business is to ask some of our neighboring sites to offer links to our page inside of theirs . If they have related services , they may be willing to help us out . __eou__ I guess we could also put out a few advertisements for our website inside of the search engine . I would like to find the most effective way to let people know about our site and our products . __eou__
Hi . I ’ m here for flight 514 returning to Beijing but the board shows there is a delay.How long of a delay is expected ? __eou__ So far it looks like we will be leaving two hours late , but keep checking the departing flights status board just in case . __eou__ Do you think it ’ s safe to leave to get a quick bite ? __eou__ I think you should stay in the airport . Even though the delay is expected to be two hours , the flight departure could be announced any minute . Who knows ? __eou__ What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ It seems there are some loose bolts on one of the wings . It happens all the time . No need to worry . __eou__ Umm ... You know ... Actually I was thinking of trying another airline . No need to hold my seat . __eou__
I hope you can help . I've got a bit of a problem with your ATM . __eou__ Of course , that's my job . Oh , dear . What's happened ? __eou__ Well , it's eaten my card ! It won't give it back ! __eou__ I see ... calm down , don't worry . May I ask what were you doing when it took your card ? __eou__ Yes . I was only entering my PIN . I'm terrible at remembering it , I'm so forgetful , you see . __eou__ Mmmm ... and exactly how many times did you enter it , please ? __eou__ Maybe three times . As I said , I always forget it . __eou__ Ah ! Don't worry ; it's just a security measure . If someone uses a card and cannot get the right PIN after three attempts , the bank keeps the card in case it's stolen . Just contact the bank and we'll get it back to you . __eou__ Oh , I see . So if I call my branch they can sort everything out for me ? __eou__ Yes , they'll be happy to help . Believe me , it happens to many people . __eou__ I'd better try harder to memorise my PIN in future . Thanks . __eou__
Would you like to know about benefits and so forth ? __eou__ Please . Everyone enjoys hearing the benefits of something ! __eou__ With this agreement we can bring over you many benefits . For example , head offices of your group companies can get really prompt integrated fund transfers and centralised allocations . This helps internal supervision and admin run smoothly . __eou__ That is wonderful . We've been having serious problems in that area . Our internal accounts seem so messy at the moment , nothing is running smoothly and it's costing us time and money . __eou__ Hopefully signing up for this Network Settlement Service will solve all of that . If you are sure , we can go ahead now , Sir . How does 10 am tomorrow sound , to get all of the paperwork out of the way ? __eou__
Good day . Welcome to IBA , what can I assist you with today ? __eou__ Hello , yes , I'm a stock investor and I'm looking at opening a new account with you . Perhaps your new compound savings one ? I already have a Current Account with you . __eou__ That's no trouble , Sir . __eou__ I'm mostly interested in the personalized services you offer , with stock market news , etc . It sounds just perfect for me , as I'm too busy to be constantly at the computer checking the performance . __eou__ Yes , that's just one of the services we offer in our Personal Financing Program . __eou__ What I need to know is how I can keep track of what's going on . I mean , some days I buy and sell quite a lot . Some days , there's no activity at all . __eou__ For every transaction you make , a statement will be drawn up and can be posted to you or sent via e-mail , or if you want to be double sure we can do both . __eou__ That's just what I need , sometimes I'm pretty forgetful . __eou__
Here is your spicy diced chicken with peanuts , sir . __eou__ Thank you . It looks very attractive . __eou__ I would advise you to enjoy the dish while it is hot . __eou__ Tasty and tender ! It must be one of the famous local dishes . __eou__ Yes . It's a traditional dish . __eou__ And it must be very particular in cooking . __eou__ You are right , sir . To prepare it , a Sichuan food chef first fries some chilli until they turn reddish brown , and then puts diced chicken breast meat into the pot with other condiments and peanuts . That's why the dish has a bright colour . __eou__ I see . __eou__ Enjoy yourself , sir . __eou__
Let's see . I had the salmon starter which was £ 5.90 and my Pizza was £ 8.25 . __eou__ I had the soup and bruschetta which all together is £ 4.50 and my trout for the main course was £ 12 . __eou__ So that's £ 14.15 for me and £ 16.50 for you . __eou__ Yes and shall we go fifty-fifty for the wine ? __eou__ Yes , so that's an extra £ 6 for both of us . __eou__ So now your bill comes to £ 20.15 and I need to pay £ 22.50 . __eou__ And I had a dessert - that's another £ 3.50 . And you had coffee which is £ 2 . __eou__ And is that all ? __eou__ Yes , this is everything on the list . __eou__ So now my bill is £ 24.50 and yours come to £ 23.65 . Is that correct ? __eou__ Yes , that's exactly it . How much tip shall we give the waiter ? __eou__ I think £ 5 would be good . __eou__
Good evening , Mr . Frank . Bourbon on the rocks ? __eou__ No . This time I'll try Chinese wine . __eou__ What about Mao Tai , one of the most famous liquors in China ? It's good indeed . It never goes to the head . __eou__ Do people here drink a lot of liquors ? __eou__ Some do , some don't . Many people in the North are fond of liquors . I think it has something to do with the climate . __eou__ Yes , it has . Some Mexicans are crazy . They drink a lot of liquors even on hot days . Have you ever heard of " Tequila Sauta " ? __eou__ Yes , it's a very well-known kind of spirits in Mexico . People drink it with salt and lemon . __eou__ Right . It's very strong , just like alcohol . ( Frank sips Mao Tai . ) __eou__ Yes , besides Mao Tai , we have Wu Liang Ye , Fen Jim and so on . __eou__ They say that Showing wine tastes quite good . What's it ? __eou__ It's rice wine , a kind of still wine , somewhat like Japanese Sake . Showing is a city in China . __eou__ I see . __eou__ By the way , we also have some good red wine and white wine , such as Great Wall White Wine . __eou__ Thank you for telling me so much , I'll try them next time . __eou__ I'm always at your service . __eou__
Steve . Is that you ? __eou__ Yeah . What's going on ? __eou__ Not much . What a surprise to see you here . __eou__ Yeah . It's been a couple of months since I saw you . __eou__ What have you been up to ? __eou__ I just started working out . __eou__ Really ? Where do you work out at ? __eou__ I joined the Samsung Health Club last month . __eou__ What do you mostly do during your workout ? __eou__ I concentrate mostly on my legs , chest , arms and stomach . __eou__ I should start exercising more . __eou__ It's hard work while exercising , but it is a great feeling when I get done . __eou__ I have a running machine at home . I used to use it , but I already got sick of it . __eou__ Exercising at home is hard . The environment is not suited for exercising . __eou__ If I want to exercise , I will need to join a gym . __eou__ I have a couple of guest passes . You want to check out my health club ? __eou__ That's a good idea . Let's go over the weekend . __eou__ Great . I'll call you Saturday morning . __eou__ Aright . I'll talk to you later . __eou__ Ok . Bye . __eou__
Your silk garments have aroused much interest in our country ever since our first order was put on the market . We have no doubt we can do better this year if you appoint us your sales agent . __eou__ We appreciate your intention , but the amount of your orders last year was moderate . __eou__ That's true . However at the Fair last March , people were so interested in Chinese garments that the demand this year will surely increase . __eou__ Do you think it will help if we appoint a local agent ? __eou__ I'm sure it will , if we are appointed your agent . Your garments are attractive , and we , a well-established importer with multiple sales channels , can boost the sales . __eou__ Well , we'll consider your proposal . __eou__

What are you doing ? __eou__ I ’ m just looking for a nice pillow on Ebay . __eou__ You are shopping for a pillow online ? That ’ s absurd ! __eou__ Why ? I don ’ t have to leave the house or browse a dozen stores to find what I ’ m looking for . This way , I just search for it online quick and easy . __eou__ I see , but how do you pay for it ? How do you know you aren ’ t going to be ripped off by the seller ? __eou__ Well , the website handles a point system where if the seller does something wrong , people comment negatively and then you know that he or she may not be trustworthy . __eou__ Wow , that sounds pretty safe . So how do you pay ? Do you need a credit card ? __eou__ You can use a credit card or your debit card . They also let you use the Paypal system which is really safe and fast .

why are you so upset today , Maria ? Cheer up ! __eou__ oh , Iris , it ’ s about the job with the PR company . __eou__ it ’ s a great opportunity . You should be happy with the offer . __eou__ but my mother won ’ t allow me to accept any part-time job . I ’ m afraid she will say no again . __eou__ why ? It ’ s unfair . You can learn a lot from it . __eou__ she says a part-time job is cursed blessing . It takes so much time and energy that I won ’ t be able to focus on my studys . __eou__ that may be true . But I ’ m sure you ’ re able to find a balance between them . Why not try it ? __eou__ I turned down quite a few offers before for her sake . But I ’ m a senior now , I don ’ t want to miss the chance this time . __eou__ I agree with you but I think you really need to talk to your mother and tell her what's on your mind . __eou__ I ’ ll try , but what if she insists ? __eou__ just let her know that the experience will be both amazing and rewarding . And more importantly , you can manage both your study and the job . __eou__ do you think it will work ? __eou__ sure . Every cloud has its silver lining . Just try . __eou__ ok , I ’ ll do that . Thank you , Iris . __eou__ sure . Good luck , Maria ! __eou__
I tried to ask the bank teller why it changed , but she didn't speak English well enough.So I decided to go to the magazine shop . The one around the corner.And I bought an American newspaper . __eou__ What happened ? __eou__ It seems that yesterday the Mexican government declared wouldn't pay back the loans it got from the World Bank.The government declared a default on the loans . __eou__ That's serious . __eou__ I know . The economy here is having serious problems.But because the government declared a default , the currency value went way down . __eou__ So now Mexican pesos are worth about half as much . __eou__ Yes , it's an amazing drop . __eou__ Wow . I feel sorry for the Mexicans . But it's good for us . __eou__ Yes , it's very good . We suddenly have twice as much money to spend here.Our hotel is now half as expensive as when we got here ! Isn't that strange ? __eou__ Yes , and you know what ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ I don't really like this hotel that much.So tonight , now that we are so rich , tonight why don't we stay in the most expensive hotel in town ? __eou__ Why not ? We should do it . Because now we can afford it . __eou__
I heard a rumor this morning ... It seems Trusten Tools is going out of business.Another competitor is going bankrupt.That could be good news for us . __eou__ I think you must have heard wrong.The truth is we are going to be taken over by Trusten.We are being bought out , and our company will be merging with our largest competitor.It ' s not good news at all ... __eou__ What ? We are merging with Trusten ? I never thought that would happen.Will we be getting new owners ? Will it affect our jobs ? __eou__ Probably.The new owners will be coming to start alignment meetings nextweek.One of the big question is what to call the new conglomerate company . __eou__ Wow , with such a big change.We won't have the same name ? __eou__ It's not only the name of our company that will change ... I expect that after this acquisition , there'll be a ton of things up in the air . __eou__
why are you in such a good mood today ? __eou__ well , yesterday , I decided to face my fear of heights . __eou__ I didn't know you were scared of heights ! Was it really bad ? __eou__ let me put it this way . I've never seen a professional sorts game in a stadium because I could never get myself to walk to the top of the stairs to sit down . __eou__ so what did you do about it yesterday ? __eou__ I went sky-diving ! __eou__ you're kidding me ! that sounds really scary ! __eou__ It was scary , but it felt great , too . __eou__ weren't you scared ? __eou__ of course I was scared . But I had an instructor that went with me and that helped . __eou__ so have you cured your fear of heights ? __eou__ I think so . After I jumped out of the plane , I realized that I should just enjoy life . Worrying about it or not doing things out of fear is just plain silly . __eou__ I'm impressed . __eou__ are you scared of anything ? __eou__ well , sometimes I get scared when I'm in my apartment all by myself . __eou__ what do you think is going to happen ? __eou__ I always worry that the door is unlocked or that a window is open and that a stranger will come in and steal my things . __eou__ it sounds like you just need to be more careful . __eou__
Here we are on the train . __eou__ Yes , we are travelling at rush hours . It could be very crowded in the morning and after 6 o'clock in the afternoon . __eou__ I hear many people have cars . __eou__ Yes , almost all the families have their own cars . __eou__ Why don't they drive ? Isn't a car more convenient than the subway ? __eou__ Well , it is hard to find a parking place in the city . Besides , parking is quite expensive in the downtown . __eou__ I see . __eou__
What were you and Richard talking about earlier ? It looked intense . __eou__ Yeah , Richard said something to me that I didn't appreciate . __eou__ Oh , no . I know how insensitive he can be . What has he done now ? __eou__ He asked me how long it took me to learn English . __eou__ But , you were born and raised in California ! __eou__ Yeah , but I get that sometimes . It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U . S . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes . __eou__ What a racist ! How can you stand working with the guy ? __eou__ You know , Richard isn't such a bad guy . He made the comment out of ignorance , not malice . __eou__ So , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn English ? __eou__ I told him 28 years . And , he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week . He was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it . __eou__ Are you sure he really got the message ? __eou__ Yeah , I'm pretty sure since I then asked him how long it took him to learn English . __eou__ That's hilarious ! What did he say ? __eou__ He said , ' 36 years , ' and we both laughed about it . He apologized and now , it's all good . __eou__ I'm glad . I bet he won't make that mistake again . __eou__
I've read your report , and I'm not sure I agree with you.You think you can get attendance improved by requiring salaried employees to take their all of their sick days ? __eou__ That's right . I know it must sound crazy to you , but we believe there will be fewer absences this way . __eou__ We give them 10 or 15 sick days per year . Surely requiring people to take them couldn't possibly help . It sounds like a counter - productive policy change to me . __eou__ Right now , we have incentives encouraging employees to come to work as often as possible.But employees with colds and the flu are coming to work and infecting their colleagues . __eou__ I see . So our current policies are encouraging sick people to come to work , resulting in more sick employees . __eou__ That's right . If sick days were mandatory , sick people would stay home . We wouldn't have these company-wide epidemics . __eou__ Let's give it a shot ! __eou__
Why are you so quiet ? __eou__ My girlfriend just broke up with me . __eou__ You must feel terrible now . __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ I remember my first break up . It was the worst feeling in the world . I was crying everyday for three months . And slowly , it got better . I know you'll feel better too . __eou__ You've been through this too ? __eou__ Yeah . I remember it very clearly . The pain makes it easy to remember . I know you're really hurting right now , but you know many people experience break ups . __eou__ But it hurts too much . __eou__ I know it's painful , but it's only temporary . After the pain goes away , you'll find other girls . __eou__ What if I don't want to find another girl ? __eou__ You'll change your mind . Look at everyone in the world . They all break up and move on . The faster you understand this , the quicker you will recover . __eou__ You're right . __eou__ I also know you must still have strong feelings for her , but try to think of all the bad things . You know she didn't treat you that well . Is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ? __eou__ Yeah . Thanks for the talk . __eou__ I'll give you a call later . We should hang out . It's good to be around people . __eou__ Ok . I'll talk to you later . __eou__
Management is going through a big turnover these days . With Bill's retirement , and department realignment , we have lost about 1/3 of our managerial staff . They've been dropping like flies ... __eou__ Isn't that a good thing ? Having fewer bosses means having less stress , don't you think ? __eou__ Actually , I don't think so . Supervisors are really important to make sure everything goes smoothly in the workplace . They are necessary for divvying up work and disciplining employees . If there is no one to keep an eye on us , no one would get any work done . You know what they say , when the cat's away , the mice play . __eou__ You're right , we do need leadership . But what we don't need is too many people to lead us . You know what they say about too many chiefs and not enough Indians ... __eou__ Alright ... I get your point . __eou__
Good morning , Miss Wang . How beautiful you look today ! __eou__ Thank you . I'm wearing make-up . __eou__ Who taught you to put on make-up ? __eou__ It's me . I have studied make-up at a beauty shop . __eou__ Can you teach me how to do make-up ? __eou__ Of course . First , use eye shadow to heighten your eyes . __eou__ What eye shadow do you think is the most fit for me ? __eou__ I think pink eye shadow is popular among Chinese girls . __eou__ How do you protect yourself from chapped lips ? __eou__ I suggest you use lipstick , which also accentuates your lips . __eou__ How did you grow such long nails ? __eou__ You have to pay attention to trimming them from time to time . __eou__
Hi , Andy . I am going to Isabel ’ s . Are you coming ? __eou__ No . The things are too expensive there for me . I can't afford it . __eou__ That is no problem at all . Isabel ’ s is having a clearance sale , and today is the last day . You don't want to miss such a good chance , do you ? __eou__ Really ? That's wonderful . Can you wait a second ? I need to change . __eou__ All right , but hurry up . It takes you hours to change . __eou__ I will . Do you think we can get something really nice and cheap ? I mean this is the last day . __eou__ I think so . They don't sell shoddy cloth for one thing . __eou__ Should we ask Cindy to come along ? She saw the evening gown made of silk last month that she wanted to buy very much . She didn't buy it of course . It would cost her three months ’ salary . __eou__ She already bought that evening gown . __eou__ When ? __eou__ Yesterday . She wore that gown last night , and showed it off to everybody at Mr . Mile ’ s party . __eou__ Oh ? Isn't that like her . __eou__ Hurry up , will you ? We ’ ll have to go to the gas station first . __eou__ All right , all right . I am ready to go . Let's go ! __eou__
Well , I am a regular member of this club . __eou__ Do you have to pay to join ? __eou__ Yes , membership fees vary depending on the club but usually they run into tens of thousands of dollars . __eou__ Wow , that much ? Don't they have any public courses ? __eou__ Very few , unfortunately . __eou__ How was your game today ? __eou__ Extremely good . I shot a 78 , including 5 birdies ! __eou__ Congratulations ! What's your normal handicap ? __eou__ Ten . How did your game go ? __eou__ My drives were terrible today . I kept slicing the ball into the roughs and sand traps . __eou__ Maybe you can correct it by going to a driving range before you play again . __eou__
Did you tip the bellboy ? __eou__ Yes , but I don ’ t think it was enough . He looked disappointed . I gave him three dollars . __eou__ That sounds about right to me , fifty cents a bag . If they think you don ’ t know better , they ’ ll try to get more . __eou__ It ’ s the same in Balloon . But I definitely think we over-tipped the cab driver . The fare was twenty dollars , and you gave him a five-dollar tip . That ’ s twenty-five percent of the total ! Too much ! __eou__ I disagree . He was polite and informative , and he drove smoothly . One should reward good service . __eou__ I ’ ll sign for dinner and charge it to our room.Let ’ s see.The bill is one hundred dollars . That seems reasonable . How much tip should I leave ? __eou__ Remember last month when we were in Europe ? Maybe Californians use that same system they add the waiter or waitress into the bill , so you don ’ t have to leave anything extra . __eou__
Alice , it really was great . I think it was the most interesting thing here . You really should go in . __eou__ No , I don't want to . __eou__ Really . The special effects are fantastic.You shouldn't be scared . You would really enjoy it . __eou__ Sam , I never like Haunted Houses.When I was a kid , I didn't like them . when I was in high school , I didn't like them.when I was in college , I didn't like them . So why should I like them now ? __eou__ But this is maybe one of the best Haunted Houses in North America ! It's different . __eou__ Why don't we go to the Epcot Center instead ? They have displays from many cultures around the world . __eou__ I saw that in the guide.It looks like they have different restaurants and different kinds of architecture.Do you want to go ? __eou__ Yes . That is something I will enjoy . __eou__ Alright , let's go then . How many tickets do we have left ? __eou__ We still have most of the tickets we bought.We can go on a lot of different rides if you like . __eou__ I was only interested in the Haunted House and the roller coaster rides.The other rides are for kids . __eou__ Let's start walking to the Epcot Center then.According to this map , it is up this pathway here . __eou__ Alright , let's go . __eou__
Why have you changed your job so frequently ? __eou__ My first job was in a well-established company where the division of labour was very clear . I do not have more chances to enrich my experience . Then I got an opportunity to really broaden my experience with a new company that was starting up , but unfortunately , they closed their service in three months ' time . I have worked in my present company for a considerable length of time and enjoy the job I am doing now , but I think I have accumulated enough experience to take up more challenging post in a much larger and diversified company where I could make solid contribution . __eou__
Hi , buddy ! How do you deal with your salary ? __eou__ I usually put them into my bank account . I think that is a little secure , though the interest rate is low now . __eou__ Look ! This stock is rising now . I am researching it , and planning to buy some shares . __eou__ Have you invested in the stock market before ? __eou__ No . This is my first time to buy some . You can see that its historical price data is rising now . __eou__ But that is a little risky , you know . __eou__ Hey ! Do you still remember our teacher of economics , Mr . Locker ? __eou__ Of course ! I remember he has a part-time job as a stock analyst . __eou__ I can ask for some advice from him . __eou__
Hello . Can I help you , ma'am ? __eou__ Yes . Could you tell me how to send some money to someone with an account with a bank in Germany ? __eou__ Well , you can pay by mail , telegraphic or SWIFT transfer . Or you can have a banker's draft and mail it yourself to the beneficiary . __eou__ Which is the best way ? __eou__ It depends on the amount and how fast you want that person to receive the money . A SWIFT transfer is the fastest method but a banker's draft is usually the cheapest . How much do you wanna send ? __eou__ $ 800 . __eou__ Why don't you send it by mail payment order ? __eou__ How long does it take ? __eou__ About a week . __eou__ I don't know . Can I send it more quickly ? __eou__ Sure . You can have a Telegraphic or a SWIFT transfer . __eou__ And how long do those take ? __eou__ Both a Telegraphic Transfer and a SWIFT transfer will normally be credited to the payee's account within three or four working days , depending on whether the beneficiary's bank is among our correspondent banks or we have to route the transfer through a third bank . __eou__ I see . How can I pay by Telegraphic Transfer ? __eou__ You have to fill out this form , ma'am . __eou__
Boy , it looks like everyone in your family is here , from young to old . __eou__ Easter's a good day for reunions . The family goes to church together . __eou__ And after church they come here for lunch ? __eou__ Yup , a big potluck buffet . And then-notice there are no children around ? __eou__ Yeah , what's up with that ? __eou__ The kids wait in the house while the grownups hide these . Hide away , Yi-jun ! __eou__
Hide me , Yi-jun ! The kids all think I'm the real Easter bunny ! __eou__ Aw , that's sweet ! I knew your costume would be a success . __eou__ It's a success all right . The kids keep trying to catch me . __eou__ Yeah , I saw that . I thought you were playing a game with them . __eou__ Some game ! You try being tackled by ten kids at once ! __eou__ Um , Holly ? Look behind you . They're coming this way . __eou__
This is a very beautiful statue . What's it called ? __eou__ It's called ' Endless Love ' . It was a gift from a sister city in Australia for the 100th anniversary of the city . __eou__ 100th anniversary ? When was that ? __eou__ Just two months ago . There were very big celebrations and there was a spectacular fireworks display . I took part in the great parade myself . __eou__ Sounds real good . It's a pity that I missed that . __eou__ Yes . We all loved the celebration of our city's birthday . It made the people feel so proud of our city . __eou__
Ange , can your dog do any tricks yet ? __eou__ Oh , yeah ! He can sit down , roll over , and even play dead . __eou__ Really ? Does he chase balls ? __eou__ Yup.Hey , do you want to see a picture ? See , he's eating lunch . __eou__ This can't be the same dog . He's so clean , he shines . __eou__ See , he's wagging his tail . __eou__ He's really cute . His bowl even has his name on it . __eou__
What sports do you like to play ? __eou__ I like baseball and basketball . __eou__ How about football ? __eou__ In my country football is brand new , so I never learned the game when I was younger . __eou__ It's a very popular game in America . __eou__ Yeah . I heard a lot about it . Is it really that fun ? __eou__ For me , it's one of those games that are fun to both watch and play . __eou__ Are you a football player ? __eou__ No , I just for fun with my friends . We play two hand touch or flag football . We're too old to play tackle football . __eou__ What is two hand touch and flag football ? __eou__ Instead of tackling somebody , you just have to touch them with two hands , or if it is flag football , grab the flag that the ball carrier is wearing . __eou__ I see . It's safer then right ? __eou__ Exactly . We play every Saturdays on the field by the tennis courts . If you want to learn and play a little , you're welcome to join us . __eou__ I'll give it a try . Give me a call and let's go down together . __eou__ Ok . I'll call you Saturday morning . __eou__ Great . __eou__
Are the ceremony and reception held in the same place ? __eou__ No , not usually . Most people are married in a church , and then the wedding party and guests go to another place for the reception . Sometimes , however , they hold the reception in a big room in the church . __eou__ Where do they go ? __eou__ Either they go to a public place such as a hotel , a restaurant , or a club , or to the home of the brid __eou__ They go to the home of the bride ? __eou__ Why do you ask ? __eou__ The Chinese custom is to go to the groom's home-just the opposite . __eou__ Oh ! In our country the bride's family is responsible for the entire wedding-arrangement , costs , etc . So the reception is held at her home . __eou__ That's very expensive for the family of the bride . __eou__ Many American furthers joke that they would rather hold the ladder for their daughter to climb down and elope than pay for a wedding . __eou__ Tell me something about the bridal bouquet . Isn't it the custom to throw it ? __eou__ Yes . When the bride and groom are ready to leave on their honeymoon all the single girls gather in one place . The bride stands with her back to them and throws her bouquet over her shoulder and they each try to catch it . The one who does will be the next one married . __eou__ Maybe I'll be the one . __eou__
... I knew it . I always knew you were a lesbian ! __eou__ She's my roommate , not my date . The D-man , as in dork . __eou__ Haha . Still got that great sense of humor , I see . Here's my card . I sell used cars . A car from us is a car you can trust ! __eou__ Alrighty then . Didn't you use to date Sheryl ? __eou__ Sweet little lassie . Yep , broke her heart when the D-man told her he couldn't be a one-woman guy . __eou__ Oh ? I heard she dumped you . Anyway , she's right over there . Oh , Sheryl ! __eou__
I ’ m not a Christian . I just want to know why Americans believe that sort of thing . __eou__ Believe what ? __eou__ You know ... like , say God is the creator of the universe , the Bible , and Jesus Christ ... __eou__ You don ’ t believe that ? Everyone interprets the Bible in a different way . To some people , the Gospel 5 is a source of much comfort . __eou__ What do you believe , John ? Are you Christian ? __eou__ To tell you the truth , I don ’ t know if I ’ m a Christian or not . Christians don ’ t often share the same belief . But I believe that we all possess , by the grace of God , the potential to create fantastic changes on this earth . __eou__ Do you believe that one religion is better than another ? __eou__ No , all religions are essentially based on the same ideals , so no one is really better . __eou__ Do you go to church regularly ? __eou__ When I ’ m home in the States , I go , but not in China . __eou__
I haven't danced for a long time . __eou__ Neither have I . __eou__ We must go to a dance soon , or we'll forget how to dance . __eou__ Yes , we must . What have you been doing since I last saw you ? __eou__ I've been studying hard for my examinations . And you ? __eou__ I've been learning Japanese every evening . __eou__ Why have you been learning Japanese ? Why not English ? __eou__ I hope to visit Japan next year . __eou__ Well , we'll both have to start learning all the new dances . __eou__ Yes , let's go into the dance-hall and ask if we can take dancing-lessons . __eou__ A good idea . They can teach elephants to dance nowadays perhaps there's hope for us ! __eou__
Consumer Credit Department . How may I help you ? __eou__ I need some info on car loans . Such as payment periods , interest rates , things like that , please . __eou__ Certainly . Do you currently bank with us ? __eou__ Yes , I do . I have a Current Account , a credit card and a mortgage with you already . __eou__ That's excellent . Well , for our Personal Automobile Consumer Loan we offer some really competitive rates . The maximum repayment period for this type of loan is 5 years . __eou__ I plan to repay it within 2 years . And the interest ? __eou__ Of course , the interest rates depend on what is announced at the time , but at the moment , the interest for a 2 - year loan is 5.29 % __eou__ So the rate is variable ? OK , that's fine . How about the frequency of repayment ? __eou__ We usually set up a direct debit system taking installments directly from your bank account on a monthly basis . And since you are already a valued customer , there should be no trouble in processing you application for this loan . __eou__ That's nice and easy . Thanks for your time . __eou__
I'm so tired ! I don't know how I'm going to make it through this lecture . __eou__ the professor is a bit boring today . You need something to perk yourself up . How about a coffee ? __eou__ I don't really like coffee , to be honest . It's too bitter for me . __eou__ well , you need something to wake you up . How about a soda ? __eou__ most some drinks have too much sugar in them . __eou__ the diet sodas don't have any caffeic in them , which one would you like ? __eou__ I like diet sprite . Does that have any caffeine in it ? __eou__ unfortunately , it doesn't . how about some diet coke ? __eou__ I don't care for coke . I heard that coke was first used as a medicine and I don't like medicine . What else has caffeine ? __eou__ maybe you should try a cappuccino or a latte ; they taste much better than plain brewed coffee . __eou__ maybe . How about a mochaccino ? Are they any good ? __eou__ you'll love that . It's just a shot of espresso beans mixed with steam milk and some chocolate syrup . __eou__ that's perfect ! Would you like one , too ? My treat . __eou__ thanks , but I'll stick with some jasmine tea . I'm trying to watch my diet . __eou__
Daniel , what are you doing here ? Aren't you supposed to be at school now ? __eou__ The same question to you . __eou__ Well , we shall make it a secret between us . __eou__ Deal , Where is Gucci ? __eou__ She is the cheer-leader . They are required to put on a performance . Look ! Here they come . __eou__ Oh , look at her . She looks like one is the basketball babies in NBA . __eou__ I want to be like her . __eou__ Get real . Don't be so pathetic . __eou__ Hey , young man ! I'm your sis . Don't talk to me like that . __eou__ Oh , man , look at her , go ! She is amazing ! She should be my sis . __eou__ Boy , you've got such a crush on her , haven't you ? __eou__ Yes , I want to be her boyfriend . Just like in the movie . __eou__ Are you out of your mind ? __eou__ She told me she liked my new haircut . She thought it was cool . __eou__ Go ahead , have a try and be a joke . __eou__
David , we have been doing business for three years , haven't we ? __eou__ Yes , I'm glad we've had very pleasant cooperation in the previous years . And your achievement for promoting our clothes was great in the three years . __eou__ So , I wish to apply for the sole agency of your product in our local market . If you give us the agency , that will be more substantial for our cooperation . __eou__ To be frank , you are not the only one who applies for an agent for us in your country . I'd like to know some ideas of terms on which you would be willing to operate as our agent . __eou__ As we are a well-established company , we are very familiar with the customers ' needs . Besides , we can make full use of our good connections with the wholesalers and retailers here and develop a good market for your products if appointed as your agent . __eou__ Sounds reasonable . I will tell my boss about you agent application . Another question , what do you think is the minimum annual sales you can guarantee ? __eou__ To be on the safe side , and for garment of all materials , sizes , and styles , I think the amount will be 50,000 pieces a year . __eou__ Well . As our sole agency , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own . __eou__ No , certainly not . __eou__
Look , Jimmy's report came today . __eou__ Let's have a look . What is this ? Where are all the grades ? __eou__ He's in the third grade Sam ! You see under each subject that he is being taught in school , he receives a mark from one to three . A one means his achievement or work is excellent . Here in Science for example he got a two , which means its satisfactory . __eou__ What about here in physical education ? __eou__ He got a three here which means it's unsatisfactory . We should work on that with him . __eou__ So confusing ! In my day we got an A or B if we were doing well and if we failed an exam we would get an F ! __eou__
hello ! How are you today ? __eou__ hi . I ’ m feeling very nervous . I just had a test and I ’ m not sure how well or how badly I did . __eou__ it ’ s not use worrying about it now . you ’ Ve done test and you can ’ t change any of your answers . __eou__ that ’ s true . I really should go home and prepare for the next test , but I ’ m feeling tired . __eou__ let ’ s go and get a coffee together . That will help you to wake up again ! __eou__ ok . I feel like sitting down and having a chat . How have you been recently ? __eou__ oh , you know me . I ’ m always happy ! If I think I ’ m getting into a bad mood , I call some friends and socialize or have a chat . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . I usually just sit at home alone and get increasingly moody . __eou__ I hate spending too much time at home . I get bored of it really quickly . I ’ m always excited about going out to party or other social event and meeting people . __eou__ perhaps I ’ m being too shy . I should go out more too and not spend time worrying about tests ! __eou__
She is really pretty , isn't she ? Her skin looks so baby-smooth ! __eou__ Well , it's just that she put a lot of makeup on her face . Actually , natural beauty comes from within . __eou__ Ah , I can smell jealousy in the air . __eou__ She has nothing that deserves my jealousy . I don't have to put things on my face and I still look pretty . Don't you think so ? __eou__ Yeah , right . But what did you put on your face last night ? Those little greenish things . __eou__ They are cucumbers . They are natural skin soothers , natural healers of the skin.Haven ' t you heard them say on TV that ... eh ... they soften the skin , wipe out the roughness , counter irritation and build strength and resilience ? __eou__ Yeah , yeah , yeah ! They wipe out tight , tired feelings and remove lines and age signs . Blah , blah ... See , I can even recite it . __eou__ That's right . You have learned a lot , haven't you ? __eou__
The police need our help finding a robber . __eou__ How do you know ? __eou__ The TV news is reporting a bank robbery . __eou__ Do they know what the robber looks like ? __eou__ Yes , he's 6 feet tall , 200 pounds , black hair , and about 30 years old . __eou__ What race is he ? __eou__ They didn't say . __eou__ The TV news doesn't tell us the race anymore . __eou__ Of course not . That would be racist . __eou__ But how can we identify someone if we don't know their race ? __eou__ Don't ask me . __eou__ Then they also shouldn't tell us if the robber is male or female , because that is sexist . __eou__
How was your interview ? __eou__ Pretty good . The HR manager asked me the usual questions . Then he wondered why I had decided to leave my previous job . __eou__ What did you say ? __eou__ I told him that I hadn ’ t got a raise for three years . I also told him that one of my best co-workers quitted her job because she had not been promoted for eight years . __eou__ Did he want to know the reasons ? __eou__ Yes . I told him that my boss made some excuses of the recession . But I thought he had a pattern and a record of promoting men only . __eou__ That ’ s sex discrimination . When will you get the reply ? __eou__ In a couple of days , I was told . __eou__ Wish you good luck ! __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Mary , besides the resume , I think we should also write an application letter . __eou__ I think so , but how should we write it ? __eou__ I think we should begin the letter with a salutation , and the salutation must be very formal . __eou__ Yes , it should be so . Then we should write the body and in the body we should mention the place where we saw the job advertisement . __eou__ We should say we are very interested in that job , and we hope to get that job . __eou__ We should write our skills and let the company know we are competent for the job . __eou__ For example , I have mastered Business English very well , and I also know a little Spanish . __eou__ Oh , you have recommended yourself very well . I should think about how to recommend myself as well . __eou__ You can say you have had a firm grasp of the professional knowledge , and you can communicate with others proficiently in English . __eou__ Yes . At the end , we should conclude the letter with greetings . __eou__ Let's write it at once . __eou__
Hello , this is Steven from Blue Sky Co . May I speak to Mr . James ? __eou__ Speaking . __eou__ Excuse my troubling you . You purchased our products last year and now I am following up to find out about their workings . Are they still in good condition now ? __eou__ Yeah , exactly ! I bought them last year . En ... at present , they are still in good state . __eou__ That's it ! All of them have first-class quality and performance . Besides , we adopt advanced technology . Now we have developed new products . They are much better than what you have bought . __eou__ Your company is developing so fast . Maybe later on I will plan to buy more . __eou__ That's great ! Thanks for your support . If any , please remember to call us . I am afraid I have to say goodbye now ! Bye , Mr . James ! __eou__ Bye ! __eou__
As you know I ’ Ve been thinking about moving my career in a new direction . I am hoping that you will be able to provide me with a reference to help me jump-start my future . __eou__ I realize that I ’ m not in a position to offer you the kind of promotion you deserve I'll gladly do what I can to help . __eou__ Thank you . I ’ Ve really enjoyed my time here . I've grown both personally and professionally with this company . __eou__ And , as well as being a pleasure to work with , you ’ Ve been instrumental in helping us complete many key projects . __eou__ It will be hard to say good-bye . This office has become like a second home to me . __eou__ My feelings are mixed on the issue too . By helping you I ’ m losing a valuable and trusted employee . However I think you are taking a step in the right direction . __eou__
Hello , are you interested in this Honda ? __eou__ Hi , I am just looking . __eou__ It's a good car . __eou__ What year is it ? __eou__ 1999 . __eou__ How about the mileage ? __eou__ 6,000 miles , all highway mileage . __eou__ What do you mean 7B __eou__ Highway miles are not as bad as local miles . They do not hurt car as much . __eou__ Oh , why such a high mileage ? __eou__ The owner was commuting everyday crossing the state line . __eou__ Okay . Does this car have a warranty ? __eou__ One month . __eou__ How do I make sure I am not buying a junk ? __eou__ You'll check it out anyway you want . You can take it to a garage . __eou__ How much is it ? __eou__ $ 5,900 . __eou__ I'll have to think about it . __eou__ Leave your phone number , and I will give you a call if the price gets reduced . __eou__ Okay . __eou__
A woman after my own heart ... __eou__ OK , Mr . Coffee Connoisseur , so what's the next step in the coffee-making process ? __eou__ Well , step two is grinding the coffee beans . I've roasted three different types of beans . __eou__ Let me guess , Mocha , Mandheling , and Santos ! __eou__ Yep , my own special blend ! You can tell by just smelling them ? __eou__ No , I just read the names off the packages ... Ha ! __eou__
When will the ceremony begin ? __eou__ The ceremony will begin at 9 0 ' clock . After the ceremony , there's a reception . By the way , do you know why they have chosen September 9th for their wedding ceremony ? __eou__ No idea . __eou__ As in English , Chinese also has some lucky numbers . The number 9 stands for perpetuity in Chinese . __eou__
What colour is her hair ? __eou__ Oh , blonde , she's very blonde ... quite short hair ... __eou__ What , curly ? __eou__ No , not at all . Very straight . Her hair comes down like this ... just over the ears . __eou__ Does she wear glasses ? __eou__ No ... no . I think you're thinking of someone else . __eou__ No . I'm sure I know her . __eou__ Er ... what else can I tell you ? Er ... she's got ... er a ... round face , a very round face , and a very big mouth , sort of wide mouth , when she laughs , her face is all mouth . __eou__ Ah ... No , I can't place her . __eou__
Susan , Did you know the four ugliest women in ancient China ? __eou__ No , I only know four great beauties of China . __eou__ There were some famous ugly women in history . __eou__ Yeah ? Were they famous because of the ugliness ? __eou__ Though they were ugly , they had great virtue . __eou__ Then who were they ? __eou__ Mo Mu , Thong Lichen , Meng Gang and Ran Nv . They were well respected . __eou__ It seems that the inner beauty is also important . __eou__ Sometimes the inner beauty is more beautiful . __eou__
How do you think people get their personalities ? __eou__ I think it ’ s mainly from the environment a person lives in . __eou__ Don ’ t you think people get their personalities from their parents ? __eou__ No , but parents control a lot of the environment that kids grow up in , so they certainly influence their kids ' personalities a lot . __eou__ So why do you think many kids have personalities that are so different from their parents . __eou__ Maybe when they become teenagers , they want to be completely different to their parents . __eou__ You might be right . I guess most parents want their kids to be like them , but kids today grow up in a different environment . You know , they know much more about the world from the internet , newspapers , and tv . __eou__ Do you think that teenagers get a lot of their bad behaviour from tv and movies ? __eou__ Maybe some of it . I think a lot of people blame TV and movies when the real problem is that the parents aren ’ t bringing their child up correctly . __eou__ Parents have a difficult job . They have to bring up their children and usually have to work too . __eou__ Yes , that ’ s true . Your son is doing well at school , isn ’ t he ? __eou__ Yes , he is . He ’ s very hardworking when he ’ s at school . Then he comes home from school and does homework before dinner . After dinner , he goes out with his friends . __eou__ So , he ’ s not a bookworm ? It ’ s good that he has an outgoing personality . Some kids are very quiet and introverted . You wonder they ’ ll survive in the real world without their parents to support them . __eou__
It's a beautiful day , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , isn't it . __eou__ Do you now the temperature today ? __eou__ It's beautiful 75 degrees . __eou__ How nice . I hope the weather will stay like this for the whole week . I'm going on the canoe trip this weekend . __eou__ Not a good plan . The TV weather forecast says the hurricane is coming this weekend , and the temperature will also drop to 66 degrees . __eou__ What a nuisance ! Every time I plan to go canoeing or camping , a storm comes along . The sky gets dark , the wind starts to howl and the temperature drops.Well , I'd better stay home . __eou__ I never make any definite weekend plan until Friday morning . Then after listening to the weather temperature , I make my plans . __eou__ That's smart . I'm going to start doing the same thing . __eou__
Anne , would you please come in for a while ? Please also bring along the minutes of yesterday's management meeting . __eou__ Of course , sir ... Here's the minutes of the meeting . __eou__ How long did the meeting last ? __eou__ The meeting was delayed by thirty minutes and it lasted for two and a half hours . __eou__ Did the chairman ask for me ? __eou__ Yes , I told him that you were very ill and couldn't attend . __eou__ All right . Have you handed in my report to him ? __eou__ Yes , I did . Besides , here are all the reports and materials handed out in the meeting . I think you'll have to do some replies . __eou__ Thank you , Anne . You've done an excellent job . Did they mention the date for the next meeting ? __eou__ No , they didn't . The chairman said he would send a memo to all managers by the end of this week informing them of the date of the next meeting . __eou__
Jane , we are going to have a board meeting next Friday . Will you please arrange it for me ? __eou__ Certainly , Mr . Robert . But can I have your plan ? __eou__ Sure . Actually it's a routine board meeting . The things to be discussed are all written here . __eou__ Very good . May I keep it ? I need it to draw up a notice of the meeting and the agenda . __eou__ Go ahead . It's for your reference . While you are at it , make me a special agenda and don't forget to have enough room at the side for notes . __eou__ You mean you need a more detailed agenda for yourself ? __eou__ Exactly . As I am supposed to the chair of the meeting , I don't want it to get out of control . __eou__ I see . Ok , then where do you think we will have the meeting ? __eou__ The conference room on the second floor , is that ok ? __eou__ Yes , I will see that the room is ready by Friday . And I will check there are enough chairs , and the lighting and air-conditioning are all right . __eou__ Good , and please get some water , glasses and ash tray ready as well . __eou__ Sure , I will . What about the minutes ? Do you think I am responsible for that too ? __eou__ Definitely . The minutes have to be taken accurately . __eou__ But I am not familiar with the members of the board . __eou__ Oh , that's easy . I will write you a list of their names . You can make a seating plan with the names and give each one a number . __eou__ That's a good idea . All right , I ’ ll withdraw and get down to it if you don't mind . __eou__
You got our email with all the specifications for the project . We'll be accepting bids untill noon on Tuesday . If you have any questions between now and then , please let me know . __eou__ Actually , I did have a question . We'd like to know what you had in mind for the budget on this project . We are hoping to put together a really competitive bid . But at the same time , we'd like to hit your target price , too . __eou__ I understand . But unfortunately , it is our policy not to disclose our bottom line . You can be assured that price is a weighty consideration when we review the proposals . We also consider other elements , including design and practicality . We also give weight to the reputation of the submitting company . __eou__ Do you have any price range ? Is there any way you can give me any idea of what direction to go or how high is too high ? __eou__ We're just looking for a reasonable price according to the specifications in our project blueprint . That's all I can say . __eou__
There are many new kinds of newspapers . I find it hard to choose among them . Which is the most popular paper circulating in our city ? __eou__ I'd recommend you the Morning Paper , it is true that the paper is a newly issued one , but its circulation is rising . Last month , it reached to three hundred thousand , which is a very good figure for a new paper . __eou__ What's the reason that people prefer to read this one ? __eou__ I think perhaps the news stories in it are truthful and accurate . It also has a special page about the stock market ; maybe this is the real reason for its popularity . Many people are now speculating in the stock market . __eou__ I can predict it will have the largest circulation in one or two years . __eou__
I Don't know how they do it ! Our competitors have undercut us by 10 % percent on the price of our latest model . There is no way will be able to compete against that . We're barely breaking even with the present prices . __eou__ These price wars are disastrous for our bottom line . If they're charging 10 % less than we are , we've got to find a way to lower our price while keeping our profit . __eou__ Profits are almost nonexistent now , we can't beat their price . How do they keep their price so low ? __eou__ We can try to lower our cost of production then . We need a price that we can compete with , something comparable with the competition . __eou__ You really think we can make it ? I don't have much faith in our ability to lower the price again . We're no match for them , the competition will beat us hands down . __eou__
Oh , what a beautiful garden ! __eou__ These are my roses . The roses have been in flower for a week . __eou__ The garden looks lovely when the roses are in bloom . You must have a lot of pleasure in planting flowers . __eou__ Yes , you are right . I love flowers and hence have taken to growing them . I take care of my flowers every day as if they are my good friends . __eou__ You did a good job . But I got tired of working in the garden . __eou__ Oh , I see . People who don't understand the nature of flowers won't be able to grow them well . I can help you learn more if you want to plant flowers one day . In this way you need not be afraid of your own sweet flower-garden's being neglected . __eou__ Yes . Thanks . __eou__
Tom , you look thoughtful and unhappy recently . What's wrong with you ? __eou__ Lily broke up with me last week . In fact , she dumped me . __eou__ Why ? I mean , why did she part company with you after seven years together ? __eou__ She said it was because we had very different ideas about life . __eou__ Do you believe her excuse ? __eou__ Of course not . I knew she had fallen in love with another guy . It is difficult to see her move on so quickly . __eou__ Come on , buddy , cheer up . Why not do some sports with me ? Violent exercise might help to shake you out of your disappointment in love . __eou__ Thank you , Steven . You are really a good friend . __eou__
How do you like the food sold in this sidewalk snack booth ? __eou__ At least , it is better than my boxed lunch at work . I'm so fed up with the bland food . Thank you for having lunch with me ! __eou__ Any time . But I don't mind eating boxed lunch . The food sanitation is really good too . __eou__ It's hard to believe that you like it . You are so easy to be satisfied . __eou__ Hey , it's not that bad . The food is nutritious and it's really convenient . I don't want to spend too much time on eating stuff . __eou__ Eating is important . You are what you eat . It's not only a daily routine . __eou__ Well , will you just go back to work after lunch ? __eou__ No . I'm going to pay the bill for the company's lunch . __eou__ But you didn't eat anything today . __eou__ Well , the bill is paid by month . That's probably the only thing that I like about a take-out restaurant . __eou__ All right . I'm going to the McDonald's . __eou__ For what ? I thought you didn't like western food . __eou__ No , I never did . It's for my son . He loves it , and I made an agreement with him that he can eat it once a week . __eou__ That's really smart . My son Daniel is the same with your son . I just don't get it , why all the kids prefer western food to traditional food . __eou__ Me , either . But , it's for sure that the children market is a really big one . __eou__ That's for sure . It's always hard for the parents to say no to their children . __eou__
Well , what a nice day ! __eou__ Yeah , the air is really fresh . __eou__ But it was not at all so fine yesterday . __eou__ Because it rained last night . __eou__ Did it ? __eou__ It sure did . It was a heavy storm , with lots of thunder . __eou__ I was fast asleep , and didn't hear a thing . __eou__ Well , it may rain again later today . __eou__ Maybe . I see some dark clouds moving in . __eou__ There may also be a strong wind coming in . __eou__ It'll be dusty , too , I guess . __eou__ Maybe not . Dust is no longer a big problem in Beijing . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ We've been planting trees for many years . __eou__ I see . The fall in Beijing is really beautiful . __eou__ But the summer isn't . It's scorching in the summer . __eou__ Then what about spring ? __eou__ Spring is warm and short in Beijing . __eou__ It must be cold in the winter , though . __eou__ You got it . Oh , by the way , it may be really cool in the evening around this time of the year . Don't forget to put on more clothes , or you might catch a cold . __eou__ Thanks for reminding me . __eou__ You're welcome . __eou__
Well , you know what , don ’ t do it , ‘ cause the minute you do , they lose all respect for you . __eou__ Well , it ’ s not like that . We just e-mail , it ’ s really nothing . On top of which I am definitely thinking about stopping because it ’ s getting ... __eou__ Out of hand . __eou__ Confusing . But not , because it ’ s nothing . __eou__ Where ’ d you meet him ? __eou__ Oh , listen , I can ’ t even remember . Ok , on my birthday , I wandered into over 30 rooms , for a joke , sort of and he was there , and we started chatting ... __eou__ About what ? __eou__ Oh , books , and music , how much we both love New York . Harmless , harmless , meaningless . Bouquets of sharpened pencils . Oh . __eou__ Excuse me ? __eou__ Forget it . We don ’ t talk about anything personal , so I don ’ t know his name or what he does or where he lives exactly . So it ’ ll be really easy for me to stop seeing him , because I ’ m not ... __eou__
Sandy , can you help me contact these people ? __eou__ Sure , what do you want me to tell them ? __eou__ Well , I need to confirm the time of their classes . __eou__ Ok , where can I find their telephone number ? __eou__ They are all listed here on this sheet of paper . __eou__ Is it their home , office or cell phone numbers ? __eou__ Unless it ’ s marked differently , it ’ s their home numbers . __eou__ Alright . What if I can ’ t get a hold of them by phone ? __eou__ Then , you should e-mail them with the information . __eou__ Where can I find their e-mail addresses ? __eou__ They should have then listed on their resumes . __eou__ And if there aren ’ t any e-mail addresses ? __eou__ Then send them a SMS on their cell phone . __eou__ Ok . That sounds easy enough . Have you called any of them yet ? __eou__ Yes . I called the first three people on the list , but they didn ’ t pick up . __eou__ Did you leave a voice message ? __eou__ I left a voice message on one---just for the first person on the list . __eou__ I see . What did you tell her ? __eou__ I told her that she should call me back at my office number . __eou__ Ok , so , maybe I should call her again . __eou__ Yes , that sounds like a good idea . She might not get the other message in time . __eou__ One more question . It looks like some of these numbers are long-distance . Do you have a calling card that I can use to get through to them ? __eou__ Sure . You can use this one . The pin number is written on the back of the card . __eou__ Alright . Thanks a lot . Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll take care of it . __eou__ Great work . I ’ m off for the weekend ! See you on Monday . __eou__ See you . __eou__
Have you made up your mind about not going back to your hometown after graduation ? Where else would you go ? __eou__ I would try to land a job in Beijing . I just want to go to one of the big cities . __eou__ why ? __eou__ many say more development opportunities can be found there . __eou__ that's true . Beijing is the political , economic and cultural center of the entire country . __eou__ and there're higher salaries there . __eou__ well , that's true , but living expenses are also higher in big cities . __eou__ I've considered that . I'll share an apartment with others to save the rent , and the cost of living won't be too much for only one person . __eou__ one person ? How about your girlfriend ? __eou__ oh , we had to break up because she didn't want to float around in Beijing . She insisted on working in her hometown and having a stable life . __eou__ sorry to hear that . It seems you have sacrificed a lot to work away from home . __eou__ sure have . I want to offer my parents a better life ; so , I'll have to work very hard . __eou__ I admire you . Good luck ! __eou__
Welcome to the Consultancy Department , I'm Greg Wu . What can I assist you with today ? __eou__ I need to do a credit investigation on another company , but I'm worried it'll be a bit difficult . __eou__ How so ? __eou__ Well , it's an American company , you see . I'm worried that there will be too much red tape involved . __eou__ We are able to do credit investigations globally . You have no need to worry . __eou__ Really ? I have been told , by another bank , that it makes it difficult if you want to investigate a company which is registered outside China . __eou__ 10 years ago , maybe yes . But nowadays we are a global village , it's easy to deal with any foreign country . __eou__ I'm not exactly prepared right now . How about I go back to the office , get the relevant information and come back before closing ? __eou__ I'll look forward to it and make sure all of the paperwork is ready and waiting . __eou__ I'll return at about 4:30 pm . See you then . __eou__
As an existing banker , that will speed up the process . You said you had the documents with you ? __eou__ That's right . Here you go . __eou__ Before I verify those , I need you to fill in some forms . Then , as I said , I need to see valid credentials , your occupation and income details ... __eou__ OK , as I expected . How much will you allow me to borrow ? I mean , I don't need a massive sum of money . __eou__ You are authorized to borrow up to 20,000 RIB , with a repayment period of up to 1 year . __eou__ That'll be enough , and the repayment period sounds good to me . __eou__ We can also look at your current credit status and adjust the interest accordingly . __eou__ How soon before this goes through ? __eou__ If you sort out all of the paperwork today , you could have your loan by the end of the week . __eou__ Perfect . So , I guess my next job is to go to the newsagent and buy some car magazines . Thanks for everything . __eou__
My wife and I are thinking about taking our parents with us on a vacation . Do you have any suggestion about where to go ? __eou__ The choice of destination is very important . It will too energetic for the old people if you make an excursion or go to climb mountains . But they'll be interested in going to the historical places of interest where they can have fun . __eou__ Sometimes what young people like is different from the old . Maybe we can go visit first and then do some shopping . __eou__ That's a good idea . That will allow both you and your parents to enjoy yourselves . __eou__ What should we bring besides a change of clothes , money and some snacks ? __eou__ It's some medicine the doctor recommends . If you leave it at home , you will find it difficult to face up when the old people suffered a seizure . __eou__ Oh , yes ! I didn't think about that.Thank you for reminding me . How many days should we spend on a vacation ? __eou__ You'd better have all a light schedule . You can rest up for a few days if your parents find tired 。 __eou__ It seems that good planning for a family vacation is important to make sure everyone will be happy . __eou__ Yes , that's right . Having an enjoyable time together is the goal . __eou__
What did you exactly do there ? __eou__ I was responsible for helping patients restore their organic functions , training them in speech and organism , carrying our massage and physiotherapy , taking care of patients ' nutrition and diet . __eou__ What do you think are the qualifications for being a doctor ? __eou__ They are sense of post , mentality quality , first aid ability , emergency adjustment , and law consciousness . __eou__
He has lots of hobbies . __eou__ And he ’ s always busy with his pictures and roses . __eou__ He ’ s won a dozen prizes for his pictures and roses . __eou__ But as for his business in the city ... __eou__ He lets his cousins look after his business . __eou__ He sounds more like an artist than a businessman . __eou__
She's a Persian . She has papers and everything . Not like a street dog . __eou__ Cats chase mice , don't they ? __eou__ And bugs . They can catch anything . __eou__ Do you have to walk a cat ? __eou__ No , they use litter boxes or go outside by themselves.Thev ' re so smart . __eou__ But then you have to change the litter box . __eou__ It's better than picking up dog poop . __eou__
Did you go to the bank to withdraw money ? __eou__ Today is so hot , besides I had so much housework to do . My friend came for a visit and stayed for two hours . I didn ’ t forget , but I had no time at all . __eou__ So you didn ’ t . Is that right ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ m sorry . __eou__ Why didn ’ t you just answer my question directly ? Why would Chinese answer questions this way ? I simply asked if you did it or not . It ’ s a very simple question . And Chinese often give the reason before they would give a direct answer . __eou__ Yes , I ’ m sorry . I know it bothers you very much . But I don ’ t know why Chinese sometimes would do this . __eou__ You know , today I asked a student if he brought his dictionary with him . It ’ s a rule I made for the class that everyone brings a bilingual dictionary with them because sometimes they don ’ t understand me . The funniest thing is that this student gave me a lot of reasons and no direct answer . __eou__ But you know if he brought it or not , right ? __eou__ Yeah , after all the explanations like , it ’ s too heavy , I was in a hurry ... whatever . __eou__
Have you ever witnessed any crimes or accidents ? __eou__ I don't quite remember . Why did you ask that ? __eou__ I was taking a walk in the park early this morning when suddenly I heard someone calling " help " . I rushed over and saw a man beating a woman . __eou__ Oh , my . What did you do ? __eou__ I guess I was stunned for a moment , then I quickly ran away to get help . __eou__ Did you call the police ? __eou__ Yes . Fortunately , I had my cell with me this morning . I called the police as I was running to get people to come to help . __eou__
what's up ? __eou__ not much . I'm just trying to hook up to the internet . I'm having a few problems though . __eou__ what's wrong ? __eou__ I've got all the cords plugged in , but it appears that I'm offline . __eou__ Are you using dial-up or broadband ? __eou__ actually , I've got a wireless connection . __eou__ In that case , you need to turn on your airport . __eou__ I hook up to the Internet every day . I can't believe I didn't do that . __eou__ do you like ever chat online ? __eou__ No , but I'd like to . Do you have to pay to do instant messaging ? __eou__ Oh , no . You can register for free . Just go to the yahoo website and it will tell you how to do it . __eou__ what do you do if people want to talk to you online but you don't want to talk to them ? __eou__ well , you can always block them . When I don't feel like talking to certain people online , that's what I do . __eou__ what's your email address ? I'll add you to my contacts list . __eou__ it's aubreyinchina@yahoo.com . __eou__ cool . We can meet up in a chat room sometime or just chat online using messenger.thanks for your help . __eou__ don't mention it . __eou__
hi , betty ! __eou__ hi , Andy , how are you finding your new job ? __eou__ pretty good . My colleagues seem alright . So far everything is great . __eou__ that's nice . What do they have you doing over there ? __eou__ well , I work in the marketing department . The corporate culture is totally different from my last employer . Before , when I was assigned a task , I was totally on my own but here most of the work is don __eou__ that ' s really good . It's very important to feel like you are part of the team at work . __eou__ indeed . Team work is highly valued in this new company . I like our boss too . He is easy to get along with treats everybody with respect and appreciation . He's highly respected by all his employees . __eou__ that's great , that's good for a positive work environment and helps motivate employees . I wish my boss was like that . __eou__ true , take my former supervisor as an example . He was extremely controlling and overbearing . He always had to micromanage everything . __eou__ well , now you don't have to worry about that . This new place sounds really good . __eou__ yeah it is . __eou__
What do you expect to be doing five years from now ? What are your medium-term career goals ? __eou__ I would like to be in a managerial role , ideally working do6ely with external clients . I have worked in client-facing roles for more than two years and I enjoy the challenge of keeping the customer satisfied . I think Ifs something I ’ m good at . Finally , I ’ d like to be on the right career path towards eventually becoming a senior manger within the company . I ’ m very aware that these are ambitious goals , however I fell through hard work and dedication they achievable . __eou__
Excuse me , I am Dunlin . I am here about your advertisement for a tourist guide . Are there still any vacancies ? __eou__ Yes . One more is needed . __eou__ Oh , I'm so lucky . I want to apply for it . __eou__ But do you have any experience like that ? __eou__ Yes . I have been a guide for two years . __eou__ OK.Then I want to ask you some questions about the tourist guide.If there wasn accident , for example a tourist falls ill , what would you do ? __eou__ I think I will call the office to send someone to meet us , and escort that person to the nearest hospital without interrupting our trip . __eou__ If one of them forgot a camera in a restaurant , would you let the tourist bus go back ? __eou__ No . In fact , prior to their boarding the bus and their getting off the bus , I will make an announcement to remind them that they should check their belongings . __eou__ Well , it seems that you have all the practical experience to handle these cases . I am very glad to welcome you into our company . __eou__ Thank you . It's my honor . __eou__
hi . Could you give me a hand with this report ? __eou__ sure . I ’ d be happy to give you some hints and advice . __eou__ thanks . Would you mind taking a look at the layout ? Do you think it ’ s appropriate ? I want it to be formal , but not boring to look at . __eou__ it looks good to me . I would suggest that you put the client ’ s logo and our logo on each page . The bosses seem to like that . __eou__ that ’ s an excellent suggestion . I can easily do it on the computer . __eou__ why don ’ t you use a different font the headings ? They ’ ll be more distinct . __eou__ I ’ ll take that suggestion too . How about the content ? __eou__ I think you ’ Ve included all the essential things . You might want to make the conclusion a little longer . Restate your reasons clearly . __eou__ is it ok to include the pictures ? __eou__ definitely ! I would include one or two on each page if possible . Remember that you should make the report as eye-catching as possible . __eou__ thanks for those ideas . I ’ ll get to work on them right away . __eou__
hello . How was the marketing meeting ? __eou__ hi . It was awful . I think I put forward some great ideas , but none of them were accepted . __eou__ I ’ m surprised to hear that . I thought you had some very good suggestions . __eou__ so did i . I ran the ideas by a few people before the meeting and their ideas seemed to have the supports of some people . __eou__ so what happened in the meeting ? __eou__ one or two people didn ’ t take to my ideas very well . That was to be expected . The worst thing was that the people who said the idea were good before the meeting didn ’ t support me during the meeting . __eou__ I wonder why not . We could always revise the suggestions , to take into account any objections . __eou__ that ’ s good advice , but I ’ m not confident that even revised proposals will be accepted . __eou__ may I make a suggestion ? __eou__ sure . I ’ m open to any reasonable suggestions . __eou__ Is there a chance you could contact the client confidentially and see what they think ? If they like your ideas , perhaps they could put them forward as their own proposals . You won ’ t get credit for ide __eou__ I ’ m not sure that ’ s a good idea . __eou__ go on . Take a chance . You could just hint at your idea . The client should be smart enough to take a hint . __eou__
I really hope to reach an agreement with you today that is suitable and beneficial for us both . I've thought through a lot of these details , and I hope we can have a chance to discuss them and resolve any differences this afternoon . __eou__ Let's get start . What kinds of things do you have in mind ? If you let us know the requirements you have from the very beginning , we can work through each one until we can come to an agreement . __eou__ Firstly , we'd like to discuss a discounted price . If you can give us a discount of 7 % on the high volumes orders , we can pay in 60 days . __eou__ Huh ... I think 7 % is little high that might be hard to do . How about this ? We'll give you a discount of 4 % , but you can have 90 days credits . __eou__ Well , that might be acceptable , if you handle the insurance fees . __eou__ No , you have to take care of the insurance . But we are willing to pay the half transport . Can you accept that ? __eou__ We cover the insurance and half the transport fee , and only have a discount of 4 % . __eou__ But you'll have 90 days to pay your bill and I'll tell you what ... I'll also throw in the discount of 10 % on your up front deposit . __eou__ Done ... __eou__
How do you get along with your boss ? __eou__ I had a terrific working relationship with my boss , even though we are very different people . Because I've had a number of bosses , I've come to realize that to make things work , you have to understand what's important to your boss . Then you have to do everything you can to support him ( or her ) . It's natural to think about your own agenda first , but if you help your boss , Ifs likely to move your agenda ahead at the same time . My last boss was great in that regard , she appreciated my efforts and rewarded me when I helped her accomplish her goals . __eou__ What do you think is important in your work ? __eou__ Many are important — intelligence , diligence , information and planning . But the most important , I think , is achieving results . __eou__
Hey , Trev ! How did the shopping go ? __eou__ “ You ain't nothing ' but a hound-dog ... ” __eou__ Trev , are you OK ? __eou__ Of course I'm OK ! I just bought a bunch of classic Elvis records ! __eou__ Aren't you lucky . The vintage-clock guy is driving a hard bargain . So I have nothing . __eou__ No sweat . Just go back and talk him down . Here comes Wei . __eou__
I am looking for a comfortable convenient way to see the country . __eou__ Have you heard of motor coaching ? It's one of the fastest-growing segments for the travel industry . __eou__ No , I've not heard of it . Tell me about it . __eou__ It's almost like going on an ocean cruise except that you go by land . Everything is planned for you from the moment you step on board a luxury coach . __eou__ Is it just a bus ? __eou__ Oh . no . The motor coach is air-conditioned , there is a galley for food preparation , movies or music are available for your entertainment and attendants are there to take care of your every need . __eou__ Wow ! That sounds like pure luxury . __eou__
Who has been here already this morning ? __eou__ Well , Vince dropped off some sales reports for you.Said you signed a big deal with HomeSupplies.com . __eou__ They're small fry . Tonight I'm going to LA to negotiate with Stars.com . That'll be big . __eou__ You're right . All the entertainment web sites follow Stars.com . __eou__ Who else has been here ? __eou__ Elvin stopped by to see me . __eou__ Elvin ? Which one is he ? __eou__
Lindsay Tipping gave me your name as a reference . We are considering hiring her as an editor for our magazine . __eou__ Lindsay , of course , I will be more than happy to recommend her to you . __eou__ How long was she employed with your company ? __eou__ She freelanced with us for 3 years . She was always consistent and punctual with her assignments and a pleasure to work with . __eou__ Freelance , hmm . How do you think she will manage in an office environment ? __eou__ She ’ s a consummate professional and a team-player . I have utmost confidence in her abilities . You can ’ t go wrong in hiring her . __eou__
What do you want to do tonight ? __eou__ I don't know . What do you want to do ? __eou__ I have no idea . Do you think we're in a rut ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , we do the same things every weekend . We go to the same restaurants . We see the same friends . You know what I mean ? __eou__ Yeah , I guess you're right . It's easy to get bogged down in the day to day , and forget to change things up once in a while . Let's break out and do something completely different tonight . __eou__ Okay , I'll look in the events section of the paper to see what's going on tonight . Hmm , we could go to a concert . There is a good one tonight . I bet it's not sold out . But , we'll have to drive an hour to the venue . __eou__ An hour ? That's a bit of a bummer . Let me take a peek and see what else there is . How about going dancing ? We haven't done that in a while . There's a club in Silver Lake that's supposed to be hopping on Friday nights . Eddie from work told me that they have a really good DJ and a big dance floor , and the cover charge isn't bad . __eou__ I'm not really in the mood for dancing , actually . You know what ? I just feel like staying home tonight and vegging , after all . How about you ? __eou__ Yeah , I was hoping you'd say that . It's nice to have the option to go out but I'd rather stay in . Maybe we can go out tomorrow night . __eou__ Yeah , definitely , tomorrow night . __eou__
What do you think is harder , reading or writing ? __eou__ Well , they ’ re completely different . Reading is passive , and writing is active . __eou__ I don ’ t think I understand what you mean . Could you explain a little more ? __eou__ In reading you need to recognize language by seeing the words on the page and knowing what they are . In writing you have to produce language , you have to create your own words on a blank page . __eou__ Oh , now I see what you mean . When you ’ re reading , you are just looking , but when you are writing , you are actually doing something ! __eou__ A reading knowledge of a language is larger and different from a writing knowledge . Don ’ t you think so ? __eou__ I think I see what you mean . I can read Shakespeare but I definitely can ’ t write it . __eou__ Exactly . __eou__ So I have another question for you . What do you think is harder , speaking or understanding ? __eou__ They ’ re both harder than reading or writing . __eou__ In what way ? __eou__ Because they are direct communication with another person , and there ’ s a time limit . This time limit is the most serious problem for foreigners , even for those who know lots of English . __eou__ You are making me feel really discouraged . __eou__ I ’ m not trying to discourage you . I ’ m trying to help you . You have to live with these difficulties . Isn ’ t it better to know about them ? The more you know about what you have to face , the better you ’ ll do . I promise ! __eou__
I can't wait until my car is repaired . The commuting with public transportation is killing me . __eou__ It can't be that bad . __eou__ But it is ! Take this morning for example . The subway was so packed this morning , I got totally squished by about a hundred busy commuters on the way to work . __eou__ At least the subway is better than the bus . It's faster for one thing . And usually less crowded . But the drawback is that the subway is more expensive than the bus . It adds up over time , if you take it every day . __eou__ That's true . The bus is even worse . Just thinking about taking the bus every day makes me tired ! Hey , how do you get to work every day ? __eou__ I ride my bike . I don't live too far away , so it's pretty convenient . it's only about a ten minute bike ride from my house to the office . __eou__ I'll bet it's good exercise , too ... a good way to keep fit . __eou__ Yes , not only a good way to keep in shape , but a good way to relieve stress as well . While you're stressed out by your commute , I'm releasing all the stress of the day with mine . __eou__
What do you want to do tomorrow night ? __eou__ What--is tomorrow night something special ? __eou__ It's Friday . We should go party . __eou__ I don't need to drink every weekend . I could be happy just staying home , you know . __eou__ Okay . Stay home Sunday . But Friday we should go out dancing . __eou__ Do you feel like dancing ? __eou__ Yes ? Why not ? __eou__ Alright.At least that's better than sitting in a bar with your alcoholic friends . __eou__ They aren't alcoholic ! __eou__ No , maybe they're not . But they're close . __eou__ So where should we go ? __eou__ Let's go to the Latin Club . I think they will have a Brazilian band there this weekend . Maybe it's Friday night . __eou__ You always want to go to the Latin Club . I don't know those dance steps . I'd rather go to the New Bar . __eou__ The New Bar is all techno music on Friday night.You really want to dance to that ? __eou__ It's not all techno music . It's not a special techno night . __eou__ No . But they play techno all the time . It drives me crazy after forty minutes.And anyhow , if we go to the Latin Club you could actually learn some Latin dance steps.At the New Bar you'll just shake yourself around for an hour.And then you'll get sick of stand you'll want to go get drunk somewhere where the drinks are cheaper . I know you . __eou__ It's fine with me if we go to the Latin Club . I like Latin Music.The only thing I never want to do again is listen to country rock.What was that bar called ? __eou__ Oh . You mean Jerry's , over on the east side.That wasn't my idea going there . __eou__ No . It was that friend of yours , Melissa.Her and all her lousy country music Cds . Yecch ! __eou__ It's true . I would never go there again either.Country music is a nightmare . So is it the Latin Club ? __eou__ Yes . You have to teach me the samba , and the tango , and whatever else they do . __eou__ Well , it seems you'll have to learn some Spanish too , won't you ? __eou__ Maybe . __eou__
So , what do you plan to do today ? __eou__ There is a Matisse exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art . Larry and I will go . __eou__ Did you buy tickets already ? __eou__ No . Do we need tickets ? __eou__ Well , probably . Probably you will have to wait in line if you don't have tickets . __eou__ Outside or inside ? __eou__ Outside , on the sidewalk . __eou__ Hmm . It's very cold today.But I brought my jacket . Maybe it will be alright to wait . __eou__ The MYOMA is very popular . There will be a lot of people . __eou__ MYOMA ? What's that ? __eou__ Oh , sorry.It stands for the Museum of Modern Art . It's an acronym . M O M A MYOMA . __eou__ I see . Do you have any suggestions for other things we should do ? __eou__ I suggest you go to the Jewish Museum.It ' s not far from the Guggenheim , near Central Park . It is really very interesting.Also , there is a great museum of medieval European art further up north.It ' s called the Cloisters . __eou__ How can we get up there ? __eou__ You can take a bus . __eou__ But Larry says the neighborhoods in the north are dangerous . __eou__
Mon and I got in another fight , Boris . __eou__ oh , Iris ! what was it about this time ? __eou__ it was over food . I simply wanted some fried chicken but she said no . __eou__ I believe she was right . You must know that fried foods contain a lot of fat . __eou__ oh , she keeps saying that . She never allows me to have them . __eou__ I think you'd better take her advice since health is the greatest wealth . __eou__ But , Boris , i am not a baby any more . __eou__ well , that's true . __eou__ how about your mother ? __eou__ she also believes in healthy diet . And she requires us to have regular meals . __eou__ poor you . It seems we are in the same boat . __eou__ Oh , i am grateful for my mother on this point . her idea of healthy eating helps me a lot keeping fit . __eou__ really ? so you don't have fried food at all . __eou__ not really . I may have some occasionally for a chance . But I don't indulge myself too much . __eou__ how do you manage it ? __eou__ it's pretty simple , Iris . Just keep it in mind that you're what you eat . __eou__
Hey Sarah . Why are you limping ? __eou__ Oh . Hi Matt . I went snowboarding yesterday and my whole body aches . __eou__ Was it your first time ? __eou__ Yeah . And I never want to go again . __eou__ I remember the first time I went . My back was sore , I couldn't sit down because it hurt my butt , and my legs would cramp if I walked too fast . __eou__ That's exactly how I feel now . __eou__ It's only like that the first couple of times . __eou__ Ha . There won't be a next time . __eou__ You gotta give it a chance . It's fun after awhile . __eou__ I'll think about it after I start feeling better . Right now , I don't even want to hear the word snowboarding . __eou__
I am going on my first date tonight . Can you give me some suggestions about what to wear ? __eou__ Well , I think you look very pretty in your polka dot purple dress with your hair piled at the rear . That makes you very graceful and mysterious . __eou__ Yeah , that's a good idea . Let me try it . __eou__ Remember to match it with your glittering star-shaped necklace . Very attractive on formal occasions . __eou__ Do I look more mature in the highheel shoes ? __eou__ Sure , more elegant and taller . __eou__ I shall wear light make-up instead of heavy . The face powder will lighten my skin color . __eou__ If I were your date , I would be so charmed by you . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
I hear that you've been to the Saikei Ski Resort for the weekend . Did you enjoy it ? __eou__ Yes , it's so exciting , though I had the most falls in our skiing team . __eou__ Isn't there any coach to teach you how to ski ? __eou__ Of course there is . The top-level coaches there are from the State Sports General Administration . __eou__ Could you move smoothly ? __eou__ Yes.My face even ached in the icy wind . __eou__ What happened afterwards ? __eou__ I was skiing on and on excitedly until I realized one thing-I could not stop ! You can just imagine how terrified I was . __eou__ Poor girl ! __eou__
Tony , could you tell me if there are any special rules about the job ? __eou__ Working hours are from 8: 30 a . m . to 5:00 p . m . Be sure not to be late or absent . Report to the manager by filling in the ' Monthly Report ' every month . __eou__ Is there anything else ? How about my salary ? __eou__ Our company has a strict and reasonable salary standard . On the 20th day of every month , you can get your salary on time . Benefits depend upon the length of service and the employee's past attendance record . __eou__ Wow , thank you for telling me these . Do you mind telling me something else , like attendance record , holiday , and how to ask for leave ? __eou__ All new members are likely to ask the same questions . Haha . I can understand that . Every month you have three days off , besides the weekends and some important holidays . After you've been here for a year , you qualify for a one-week vacation . The leave less than a half-day should predict for an hour , and more than a half-day should predict three days . __eou__ Okay , that's good . I get it . __eou__
You must be very busy these days . I heard you are responsible for the meeting arrangements this time . It can be the most important meeting for our company this year . __eou__ Sure it is . I am up to my ears as time expressed . __eou__ Do we still use the conference room in the same hotel as last time ? You remember ? I like that one . __eou__ If we were in the same conference room , I would not work late these days . That conference room has been booked out . This time our boss wants to hold the meeting in our company . So everything has to be rearranged and checked , like tables , chairs , mean tacks , podium , audio and visual equipments and even the lunch menu . __eou__ Good preparation will improve the effectiveness of the meeting . I am sure that your hard work will pay off . __eou__
Comfort Inn , may I help you ? __eou__ I ’ m looking for a hotel near the convention center . __eou__ You ’ re in luck ! We ’ re just a two-minute drive from there . Would you like to make a reservation ? __eou__ Not just yet . I have one or two questions . How much for a single ? __eou__ During the peak season , a single room goes for 50 dollars on a night . But we ’ Ve got a Single Super Saver Special going on right now – only $ 30 a night . And we ’ Ve also extended our checkout time 00 in __eou__ That ’ s a good deal . Since this is a working trip , I wonder if you have meeting rooms where I can get together with some clients . __eou__ Yes , we have five meeting rooms , of various sizes . We can accommodate large meetings and small , informal gatherings as well . Of course , if you have many small meeting , you might consider checking __eou__ That sounds great . Do you accept checks ? __eou__ I ’ m sorry , sir , we don ’ t . But we do accept all major credit cards . __eou__
Is there anything else , apart from the Credit Rating and Debt to Asset Ratio ? __eou__ There is the Balance of Net Liabilities . This must not exceed its net assets and no business loss can be shown during the past two years . __eou__ Right , OK . That , again , shouldn't be a problem . __eou__ And the total ratio of return on assets should not be lower than the average , for that particular industry , for the first two quarters of the year . __eou__ Well , as far as I can tell , we qualify . __eou__ Of course we will need proof , originals and duplicate of everything . As soon as you bring in the proof and we assess it , it should be very quick indeed . __eou__
Mr . Black , when is the earliest shipment you can make ? __eou__ In April or early May . __eou__ I am afraid shipment by early May would be too late for us . Our customs formalities are quite complicated , and it takes time to distribute the goods to the farmers in our country . The fertilizers must be delivered before April , or else we can't be in time for the spring sowing . __eou__ In that case , we will have to improve one month further on the time . Now is Jan . If the fertilizers should be shipped before the end of March , only 2 months are left . The time is too limited . __eou__ You understand a timely delivery is very important to us . __eou__ All right . You can rest assured that we will do everything possible to advance shipment . The fertilizers will be delivered before April . __eou__
Now let's use the weight machines . __eou__ How about the rowing machine __eou__ Great . They've all got built-in TVs . __eou__ Cool ! We can watch Ally Mcneal ! __eou__ But we could just stay there for 20 minutes . __eou__ What exercises can I do to firm up my backside __eou__ I would recommend doing some squats . Spread your feet about shoulder-length apart , toes facing forward , and slowly bend at your knees . __eou__ Like this ? __eou__ Keep your back straight and look forward . Good . Do about 3 sets of 20 . __eou__
Wow . That girl who brings the fruit is really pretty ! I wish she wouldn't have rushed off so fast ... __eou__ Hey , it's an English song ! Sing with us , Ryan ! __eou__ " Tie a Yellow Ribbon on the Old Oak Tree " ? ! Where did you learn that song ? __eou__ Everyone in Taiwan knows it . Come on ! Sing with us ! __eou__ I'm sorry , but I can't ! That's something my grandmother would sing ! __eou__
I don't know what I'm going to do . I need to find a job . If I don't , I won't be able to stay here next semester . __eou__ Have you tried university part-time jobs ? __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I mean in the library , or in some information center.Often the university hires foreign students for part-time positions . __eou__ Yes , I know . I tried that.They don't have anything now . So what can I do ? __eou__ Well , since you're a foreign student , it's hard.That ' s because it's actually illegal for you to work in America . __eou__ I know that . You don't have to tell me that . That's my problem . I know I have the right to work for the university . That's legal.But they don't have a job for me . And it's illegal for me to get a job elsewhere . __eou__ Anyway , there must be some solution.You know there are many people working illegally in New York . __eou__ But I need a pretty decent job . I need to make enough to pay my rent at least . __eou__ I have an idea . __eou__ What ? __eou__ Since you're Chinese , maybe you can find part-time work in Chinatown . __eou__ I already had that idea . __eou__ Well , why don't you go and look down there ? __eou__ But I don't know what I would do . __eou__ It may be part-time work as a waitress or something.It would be illegal , but sometimes waitresses make a good salary . __eou__ Maybe . I don't know . __eou__ I will ask my friends for you.Maybe someone knows a company that needs part-time people.That ' s another thing you should do . Ask all your friends to ask around for you.You might find something . __eou__ I have to find something.Otherwise I have to go back to Taiwan . I'll be broke in two months . __eou__
I've never met anyone like Clyde before . __eou__ He's such a buppie-a black yuppie . Black people come in all shapes and sizes . Just check out the party . __eou__ Wow ! There are so many different people here . I expected mostly athletes and rappers . __eou__ You'll find some of those here , too . But not if you don't shake it up ! There's an African saying , “ If you can talk , you can sing ! If you can walk , you can dance ! ” __eou__ Then I'll just shut up and sit down ! __eou__
Hi , Boss ! I'd like to tell you what we've discussed during the day . __eou__ Okay . Is all going well ? __eou__ I think it's going very well , actually . We had a long meeting with them . After several lengthy discussions they decided to accept our offer . __eou__ Really ? That's great . You really did a good job . Anything else to tell me ? __eou__ We're meeting with their finance director today and then with the other directors tomorrow , just to sort out some final details . __eou__ OK . If he wants to make any changes , minor alternations can be accepted . Let me know what happens . __eou__ OK . I never forget it . __eou__
I find that you spend little on handset charge every month . Have you any trick ? __eou__ It's simple . You can use call transfer . __eou__ Is it so simple ? __eou__ Sure . You know , we spend most of our time at home or in the office every day , so I receive handset calls with the hand-free telephone , so I need pay little for receiving calls . __eou__ It's true . __eou__ Call transfer has many other advantages . When I am in places where network can't cover , such as the high building , I also use call transfer function , which transfers my calls to the hand-free telephone and I will not miss any call . __eou__ That's all ? __eou__ In hospitals or on planes , handsets will interfere with some equip-ment , so we must close our handsets . If you set call transfer , the problem will be solved . __eou__
I hear you're being sent to Madrid for the annual conference . Is that right ? __eou__ Yes , it would be my first trip overseas . Actually , it's going to be my first time leaving the country . __eou__ Are you serious ? You haven't even been anywhere on vacation ? __eou__ No , I have never vacationed anywhere exotic . But even if I don't get a chance to travel on my personal time , at least I can travel on company time ! __eou__ Well , being able to go to the conference sounds like such a great opportunity . Have you applied at the embassy for a visa yet ? __eou__ Yes , it wasn't too hard to get . All I had to do was fill out the paperwork and pay the application fee . __eou__ You leave next Tuesday , right ? What time is your flight ? __eou__ My flight departs at 7 am . I have everything except for my luggage ready . __eou__ If your flight is leaving so early , I can take you to the airport and see you off . I'll still be able to make it into the office by 9 . __eou__ That would be great ! Thanks a lot ! __eou__
Good evening , sir . Welcome to the Comfort Inn . __eou__ Hello . I have a reservation , under the name Lee , Leo Lee . __eou__ Mmmm . I ’ m not sure if we have you down here . How do you spell your last name ? __eou__ It ’ s L-e-e . __eou__ Oh , right . You ’ re in our system . I was just looking under Li . So , we ’ Ve got you down for a Business Suite for three days . If I could just have your credit card , I ’ ll process your check-in while __eou__ You mean I have to pay now ? __eou__ Oh no , we just make an impression of your card using our credit card machine . It ’ s in lieu of a deposit . If everything is OK when you check out , we give it back to you then . It ’ s pretty sta __eou__ I see . I guess you can tell I don ’ t travel much . __eou__ ( later ) Here ’ s your card , sir . You ’ re all checked in . let me just tell you about a few of our services . We have free breakfast in the lounge from 7:00- 9:00 . You call the receptionist to arrange __eou__
Hi . I ’ m here for flight 513 to New York but I thought I heard the paging system announce that it is canceled . Is that true ? __eou__ I ’ m terribly sorry , sir , but I ’ m afraid it is true . That flight has been canceled . Would you like to try to book tomorrow ’ s flight ? __eou__ No way ! I worked very hard so that I could leave on today ’ s flight . Are there seats on another airline ? __eou__ It ’ s possible . If you would like to book with another airline the line is right over there . __eou__ You mean the line over there of about 200 people ? ! __eou__ That ’ s the one . It seems that everyone is anxious to get to New York tonight . __eou__ This is a rotten way to start a vacation . I HATE lines ! Can you book me on tomorrow ’ s flight ? __eou__ Certainly . You will also be receiving a 50 % discount as our way of apologizing for the inconvenience . __eou__
I'm going to work in a multi-national enterprise after graduation . __eou__ but you said your dream was to be an entrepreneur , to be your own boss . __eou__ I'll do it someday . But it's not the right time now . I have to learn a lot by working as an employee . __eou__ it sounds like you've got a perfect plan . __eou__ you could say so . I'll work hard in that company and try to understand as much as possible about how to run an enterprise . __eou__ it can save you lots of time and effort to simply copy a successful business model . __eou__ yeah , the success stories of that company might be useful for me . And their customers may become the potential ones for my own company . __eou__ that's right . You should establish good relationships with them . what else are you planning to do while working for that company ? __eou__ well , I'll come up with a detailed business plan to attract the investors . __eou__ sounds perfect . I think with all that you have in mind , you'll become a successful businessman . By then , perhaps , I'll join in as a partner of your company . __eou__
It may comfort you to know that many people attended his viewing . __eou__ How did they hear ? No one called . __eou__ In times of loss , it is often hard to pick up the phone . But his whole family was here . __eou__ His mom and dad must be destroyed . He was their only son . __eou__ And he was so young , with so much life to look forward to . __eou__ Yes ... thank you for understanding . We have to go now . __eou__ This sheet tells the visiting hours and funeral time and location . __eou__
Morning , Mary . I haven't seen you in a long time . What's up ? __eou__ Oh , I took up a new hobby . __eou__ So you don't travel a lot now ? __eou__ No , Frank . I'm much more interested in collecting stamps now . __eou__ It's certainly a popular hobby . I know a lot of people love stamps . __eou__ It certainly is . It's so much fun . __eou__ I believe collecting stamps has something similar to traveling right ? __eou__ Absolutely . Through all kinds of stamps I am able to learn about the world . __eou__ Well , every stamp has a story to tell . __eou__ You're right . And I also meet many new friends while collecting stamps . __eou__ Good . __eou__ Sometimes we even spend hours discussing our collections . __eou__ There's a lot to share when you have a common interest . __eou__ Yes , it's really amazing . I got to go now . I'm meeting with some other collectors . __eou__ Ok , good luck . See you __eou__ See you , Frank . __eou__
Good morning , sir , can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , I was wondering if you had the time to show me around this exhibition ? __eou__ I'd be glad to , sir . But may I ask what line of business you are in ? __eou__ I'm in the electrical appliances . __eou__ I see . Would you be interested in seeing the audio-visual products ? They are made by our company . __eou__ Thanks , they are rather attractive . But I think there is nothing better than seeing things In actual operation . __eou__ Yes , of course . Would you like to make an inspection tour of some factories ? __eou__ Yes , very much , if it wouldn't add inconvenience to you . First hand information is always more valuable than reading pamphlets . __eou__ I'll make the arrangement and let you know the time tomorrow . __eou__ That would be great . __eou__
Have you had any experience with sales work ? __eou__ Yes , I have . In fact , I had worked for a foreign trade company for nearly two years , where I established business ties with several firms . __eou__ What exactly did you do at that company ? __eou__ Visit customers , dispatch consignments and things like that . __eou__ Did you like your work ? __eou__ Yes , I did . __eou__ But when and why did you leave the company ? __eou__ I left it two months ago . I didn't think I could learn much there , and there were not many opportunities for self-development . __eou__ I see . Why did you choose our company ? __eou__ I've been informed that there are many opportunities to develop myself in your company . Besides , I grew up in a city in the Northeast . I have lots of acquaintances in the region , which might help to push sales . __eou__
I'm going to the shops in a minute . What do we need ? __eou__ We're okay for vegetables but we should stock up on meat . Can you go to the butcher's and get some veal and some beef ? __eou__ No problem . We also need bread , so I'll go to the baker's . I'll get some vol au vents for Victor's birthday bash on Friday . We'll need balloons for that too . __eou__ Better visit the supermarket then . We'll need some other things for the party . Get some vanilla ice cream , some butter and some vinegar and twelve bottles of beer . __eou__ Okay . The library's beside the baker's . I'd better take back the videos we borrowed last week . They're overdue . __eou__ I'll see you later then . __eou__ Bye ! I'll be back before seven . __eou__
Mom , I'm starving . __eou__ Here are some biscuits . Why are you back so early today ? __eou__ My teacher had a sudden stomachache , so the class was cut shot . You ? __eou__ Me what ? __eou__ You are cooking at least two hours earlier than the usual . __eou__ It's not for us . __eou__ Then it's for Dad , isn't it ? It's so unfair ! __eou__ Don't be a smarty-pants . It's for Grandma Wang . __eou__ What was that again ? __eou__ It's for Grandma Wang . She is sick and her only daughter went abroad weeks ago . So she needs our help . __eou__ I'm sorry , I didn't know that . But I wanna help . __eou__ Umm , let me think for a moment . We can meet her together after I finish cooking . __eou__ I'll get knee to knee with her . __eou__ Good boy . I can only imagine how happy she will be to see you . __eou__
How big is this parking lot in our community ? __eou__ It has fifty parking spaces . __eou__ So you guys should be always busy . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ I bet it is always full of cars . __eou__ Quite the contrary , sir . Plenty of the spaces here are free when people drive their cars out to work . __eou__ Ah ... I see . __eou__ We plan to rent some of them out at the hourly rates . __eou__ What is the hourly rate for a car like this ? __eou__ I am not sure . But it'll be at least ten yuan an hour . __eou__ How mush would it cost if someone parks here for one hour and ten minutes ? __eou__ That would be twenty yuan , sir . We charge only by the number of hours , no split of each hour . __eou__ That's expensive . __eou__
Ok , honey , time to take down the Christmas tree . __eou__ Do we have to ? __eou__ Come on , it ’ s losing needles all the time and the branches are sagging . __eou__ It ’ s not that bad , besides it really looks nice in that corner . It gives the room a good atmosphere . __eou__ A good atmosphere ? The tree is falling apart , and it ’ s messing up the room . __eou__ But it makes the place feel so much like Christmas . I ’ d really hate to have to take it down . __eou__ But Christmas was two weeks ago ! It ’ s been there only because we ’ Ve been too busy to get rid of it . __eou__ I know , but it seems like such a shame to have to take it away . __eou__ But it ’ s falling apart , and the cat keeps playing with the lower branches . __eou__ I know , I know . But it reminds me of the great Christmas we just had . All of us were here - - my parents , your parents , the kids , and the cousins - - the food was good , and everybody got what they wanted . __eou__ Yeah , it was a good Christmas . It won ’ t always be this good , but we can ’ t make it last longer than it should . __eou__ Ok , fine . We need to take down the tree . __eou__ I ’ ll make a deal with you . We ’ ll leave it up until Sunday , and then we ’ ll take it down after church . __eou__
This looks like a very nice house . __eou__ You know , I fell in love with this house the first moment I laid eyes on it . __eou__ The style of the exterior is just what I ’ Ve been looking for ! __eou__ The exterior is only half of the story . The interior is incredible . __eou__ This home is gorgeous on the inside ! __eou__ Everything that you see on the walls , floors , and windows is brand new . __eou__ The wall colors totally suit the style of this house . __eou__ Straight ahead is the gourmet kitchen . __eou__ I love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops . __eou__ The master suite is the best . Let ’ s go look at that next . __eou__ There is plenty of room for our king-sized bed , and I love the light in this room . __eou__ I know that you like this house , but let ’ s take a look at the others before you make up your mind . __eou__
You look a bit dull today . What's up ? __eou__ Well , my mum lost her job yesterday . __eou__ I'm sorry to hear that . Well , I heard that registered urban unemployment rate reached 4 percent this year , with more than half being women . __eou__ The supply outstrips the demand in the job market and women are in a disadvantageous position as a whole . __eou__ Yeah , it's true . What is she going to do ? __eou__ Well , she is thinking of doing some household cleaning or baby sitting in the community . __eou__ That's not bad . It could be a short-term alternative . Your mum can look for another one when the market improves . Things will work out eventually . __eou__ Thank you . I just hope she won't feel pressed . __eou__
Are you going anywhere for your vacation ? __eou__ Yes , we're making plans for a tour . __eou__ That'll be lovely . Where are you going ? __eou__ Well start out from Long Island this Friday . We've planned a four day drive to Salt Lake City , where we'll join my brother and his family on his fortieth birthday . __eou__ Well , you've got to prepare a lot of food and enough sleeping bags then . __eou__ Oh , we'll spend the nights in hotels and enjoy local food as we pass by . How does it sound , David ? __eou__ It sounds good . You can do a lot of sightseeing , too . __eou__ Yes , we'll take our time . And we'll go to Five-lake Strict and the Wall Street . __eou__ So , you're going to have a really nice vacation . __eou__ You can say that again . __eou__
I have some good news for you . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ Jenny is getting married . __eou__ Great ! Who's the bridegroom ? __eou__ Tom , that lucky guy . __eou__ The guy always hands the girls in a line . When did he propose ? __eou__ Last week , It said that he fell in love with Jenny at Mrs.Whit ' s party last Monday as soon as he saw her . __eou__ My gosh ! How romantic ! When's the big day ? __eou__ July 4 , the National Holiday . __eou__ Will it be a church wedding or a civil ceremony ? __eou__ Jenny plans to hold it in church . __eou__ Who is the best man ? __eou__ Guess ! __eou__ Nobody is OK , but you ! __eou__ You know , Tom is my best friend and he asked me to be his best man . __eou__ Did you promise him ? __eou__ Yes , I did . __eou__
May , we are fools to hang out at noon . It's dying hot today . My skin is too weak to be exposed under the summer sun . __eou__ Do you have any sunscreen lotion ? __eou__ You know , honey , I used it all on the way over . __eou__ I think I'm getting a heart stroke . __eou__ The heat is driving crazy and I hate my new hat . __eou__ Why ? It's brand new , and it's perfect on you . __eou__ But I bought it to get rid of the heat . Now it does nothing but burning my head . __eou__ Beauty costs , honey . __eou__ Laugh all you want , whatever . We need to get out of the heat . __eou__ Walking under the sun is certainly not the way . __eou__ Give me a break . It's not funny . __eou__ Right . Sorry . Anyway , the radio said that it'll rain later today . __eou__ Hope so ! Good thing is that autumn is just around the corner . __eou__
Oh dear , Miss , you are soaked ! Wow , it's really raining heavily outside . __eou__ Yes , it sure is . I had to run here from work ! I need to rush as I'm on my lunch break . __eou__ Well please , why don't you go ahead of me in line ? I'm in no hurry . __eou__ Oh , that's so nice of you ! Thank you very much . __eou__ My pleasure Miss . Actually , could you recommend what to eat here ? I've never been here before . __eou__ Sure . Well , the avocado sandwich is delicious , and it's the healthiest thing on the menu . Personally , I think the beef salad is the tastiest choice . I usually get that . Also , the milkshakes are the best milkshakes in town ! __eou__ Well , thanks for the suggestions . __eou__ Oh , don't mention it . __eou__
In the past half year , we made some schedules and objectives , do you still remember that ? __eou__ Of course . I spent the whole week to know the general process for these plans . And since I was employed , I have been working on them . Madam , how am I doing ? Are you satisfied with my job ? __eou__ How do you feel what you have done ? Did you meet our goals ? __eou__ I suppose so . I tried my best to be familiar with all these appliances and office process . Certainly without my colleagues ' help , I could not do these things in such a short period . __eou__ Yes . And you also overworked in last month , when Steven asked for leave . I have been very satisfied with your performance . And your dependability has been a great asset . __eou__ Thanks for your praise , Madam . __eou__
This is our main service area . We do all the routine services here and have two full-time mechanics . __eou__ How often do you service the vans ? __eou__ They're serviced regularly . We give them a basic service every 10,000 km or so and a main service once a year , or every 100,000 km . __eou__ I see . What does the service involve ? __eou__ Well , the same as for private vehicles really , but we do it more often because they get a lot of wear and tear . __eou__ Can you carry out major repairs here ? __eou__ Yes , we've got all the necessary equipment . We can give the engines a major overhaul . If there's a serious problem , we strip down the engine and find the faulty component . Would you like to look around ? __eou__
Hello ! You're welcome to Guangzhou Fair . __eou__ Thank you . I'm from America . Here is my business card . __eou__ Glad to meet you , Mr . Smith . My name is Wang and here is my name card . I'll be glad to do what I can for you . __eou__ Great ! This is my first visit to the Fair . Everything is new to me . Would you please give me some information ? __eou__ Glad to . The Fair is a big gathering taking place twice a year , thousands of businessmen from more than a hundred and fifty countries and regions are here to trade with China . __eou__ What about your company ? __eou__ Ours is a company special in exporting leather products .

Do you drink much ? __eou__ Depending on what you consider a lot . __eou__ How frequently do you drink ? __eou__ Couple times a week . How about you ? __eou__ Only when I go out . I'm not a big drinker . __eou__ How much can you drink ? __eou__ I usually only have 2 beers . __eou__ You're a light weight . __eou__ How much can you drink ? __eou__ I'm usually drinking all night long . At least 10 drinks . __eou__ Don't you spend a lot of money then ? __eou__ No . We usually go to places that have specials . Dante's over on the Ave has $ 5.00 pitchers on Mondays .

Sorry , sir , we've tried everything , but we're not able to get it off the shirt . It was from the sugar I think . __eou__ It's been several days now , I am not sure . __eou__ Yes , the sugar was burnt during the dry-cleaning process . And there you go . __eou__ Oh , that's so bad . I know little about that . Is there a remedy for it ? __eou__ I am awfully sorry . Please tell us about the stains before the dry-cleaning next time . __eou__ OK , I will . __eou__ This is a membership card .

I decided to give it a go ! __eou__ Good for you . What items did you bid on ? __eou__ A DENY shirt and one of Serena Williams ' used tennis rackets ! __eou__ Your idol ! Wow ! You're even better at finding stuff than me ! __eou__ Yep . I placed a bid for the shirt . The minimum was ten so I bet fifty ! __eou__ That's not how this game works . __eou__ Well , there was a sign that said “ Buy now for seventy . ” __eou__ How many bids had been placed before you ? __eou__
OK ... well , then how much is one jin ? __eou__ Ginseng comes in 6 different grades . It runs from 5,000 to 30,000 NT a jin . __eou__ 30,000 NT for ginseng ? ! Do I have to buy a whole jin ? __eou__ You can get a liang if you want . A liang is one-sixteenth of a jin . That would be 330NT . __eou__ Whew ! That sounds more like my price range . I'll take two liangs . __eou__ I'll have my brother cut some for you . __eou__ This little red fruit looks good . What's it good for ? __eou__ That's a lucky fruit called hong zat ! People say that if you eat them , you will have your first son very soon ! __eou__ Uh ... , I'm not even married yet . How about this brown dried fruit ? __eou__ Gui yuan are lucky , too ! If you eat them , you'll have a very sweet life ! __eou__ And how about these little brown chips ? __eou__ Oh , that's deer horn . That helps you ... umm , how should I put it ? __eou__
Mmm . Nice and crunchy . And they leave a space uncovered for you to hold ... __eou__ They're so much fun to eat .

Give me another pack . __eou__ Hey ! The movie hasn't even started and they're almost gone ! __eou__
Hi , excuse me . I am sorry to bug you , but do you know where the Royal Hotel is ? __eou__ Just a minute . I am as busy as a bee right now ... Ok , I am done . What can I do for you ? __eou__ Well , I seem to be a little bit lost here . I am worried that I ’ ll never find my way . What's worse . I forgot my glasses and as blind as a bat now . __eou__ Well , keep you chin up ! I ’ ll try to help you . Where are you going ? __eou__ I am trying to get to the Royal Hotel . Do you know where that is ? __eou__ Yes , no problem . You walk down this street . You turn left at the first intersection . Walk along that road , turn right at the corner . After that , you make a left-hand turn at the first traffic light . The Royal Hotel is on your right side . __eou__ Great . Are there any landmarks nearby ? __eou__ Yeah , I think so . I think the hotel is right across the street from a post office . It is as plain as the hump on a camel . You can't miss it . __eou__ Oh , that's good . I should be able to find it pretty easily then . Is that far from here ? __eou__ Yeah , it ’ s gonna take you a while if you go by foot . I ’ d say it's about a 30 - minute uphill walk . You have to be as strong as a lion to make it . __eou__ Oh , that will take too long and I am kind of in a hurry . Can I take a bus there ? __eou__ Well , you could take a bus there , but you would have to transfer buses twice . A taxi would probably be a lot quicker . __eou__ All right . I guess I'll take a taxi then . How long will it take by taxi ? __eou__ Not too long . It should take about ten mins by taxi . __eou__ Cool , thanks . __eou__ You are welcome . __eou__
Kathy ! How are you ? It's been ages ! What are you doing these days ? __eou__ I just opened my own restaurant . I'm also head chef . __eou__ You're kidding ! You've always hated cooking ! __eou__ Well , I used to hate cooking , but now I love it . __eou__ When did you change your mind ? __eou__ After I tried French food . Before that , I used to cook really boring things for my family . __eou__ I still can't believe it ! So , did you go to cooking school or something ? __eou__ Yeah . I went to California to study . __eou__ Really ? How long did you stay there ? __eou__ I was there between 88 and 90 . __eou__ And what did you do after that ? __eou__ Then I came back here . I worked for about three years to get some experience . __eou__
Balista , pull me a ristretto . __eou__ What ? You're suddenly some kind of coffee snob now ? What's a ristretto anyway ? __eou__ It's basically a very strong espresso . Half the water pulled through the same amount of beans . Pure coffee essence . __eou__ Sounds like it must be just full of caffeine . I want one of those instead ! __eou__ You fiend . It's about the flavor , not the fix . Why don't you just crush some caffeine pills and start doing lines ? __eou__
Did you see Victor on Wednesday , Wendy ? __eou__ Yes . We went for a walk in the woods near the highway . __eou__ Wasn ’ t it cold on Wednesday ? __eou__ Yes . It was very cold and windy . We wore heavy wool sweaters and walked quickly to keep warm . __eou__ It ’ s so nice and quiet in the woods . __eou__ Yes . Farther away from the highway it was very quiet and there were birds and squirrels everywhere . We counted over twenty squirrels . __eou__ It sounds wonderful . Did you take lunch with you ? __eou__ Yes , we bought veal sandwiches . We stopped around twelve , and we ate and watched the squirrels , but it was too windy to sit long . It was a very nice walk , anyway . __eou__
Mary ! I haven ’ t seen you since our dinner with Mr . Lee last week . Where have you been hiding yourself lately ? __eou__ Oh , hi Mike . I ’ Ve been out of town the last few days . What did you need ? __eou__ Really , nothing big . I just heard about your ideas on employee motivation and I wanted chat with you about a few things going on in my department . __eou__ Well , feel free to drop by my office any time . The door ’ s always open . __eou__ Actually , I was hoping to mix business with pleasure . Would you be interested in joining me for dinner some time this week ? I thought we might try out the new Italian restaurant everyone ’ s been __eou__ Sure , Mike , I ’ d love to . __eou__ Is this evening too soon ? __eou__ No , that ’ s perfect . We can leave directly from here . __eou__
Well , let's have your firm order . __eou__ Yes , here is our offer , 30,000 skirts at 200 yuan per skirt , FOB New York . You will find our price comes in line with the prevailing market . __eou__ Your price is rather high . We cannot accept it . Can you bring the price down a little ? __eou__ In fact , if it weren't for our good relations , we wouldn't consider making you a firm order at this price . __eou__ I can't agree with you . We have quotation from other sources too . Their prices are lower than yours . __eou__ But you know our design is superior to any other products from other companies . In fact , there is no room to negotiate the price now . You should be aware that the production cost alone has doubled in the past year . __eou__ It doesn't seem very hopeful to close the deal on this price . __eou__
How can I be sure your products are of superior quality , as you promised ? __eou__ One of the reasons for our good quality products is because of our quality inspection system , which is the best of its kind . __eou__ But a quality inspection system does not mean that each unit will always be up to the standard . __eou__ We have trained analyzers to do quality analysis at the end of each part when we make the product . This means that no mistakes are made . __eou__ Your salesman also told me that each worker is trained to do quality analysis . Can you tell me a little about that ? __eou__ Certainly . We provide quality analysis training as part of the training for all new workers , plus a week of further training every year . __eou__
Where on earth are we going to borrow at 3 % ? __eou__ We can borrow from a bank , the gross interest rate will be something like 7 % . With corporate tax at say 30 % . We are only paying on 50 % of this . There is still inflation to consider . __eou__ You can knock off another 2 % for that . __eou__ We can borrow as much as we can . __eou__ Not quite , if we get too heavily in debt , the shares will tend to drop . __eou__ How much loan capital can we safely raise then ? __eou__ I would like to have notice of that question , I will give you an answer in a week . __eou__
Good morning , Mr Zhang , I wonder whether you have got an answer from your superior . __eou__ Yes , we had a meting about it yesterday afternoon . __eou__ What's the answer ? __eou__ We decided that we could agree to your price , but we are a bit worried about the slow delivery . __eou__ Let me see . I quoted your delivery in three months , didn't I ? __eou__ Yes , but we hope that the wool could reach us as soon as possible . __eou__ I thought you would be worried about it . So I rang Auckland last night . As you are our biggest customer , they agreed to ship the order on the first vessel available that will leave Auckland next month . __eou__ Good , if you agree we'll draft the agreement right away and sign it then . __eou__ By all means . __eou__
May I help you , Miss ? __eou__ Yes , I'm excited to hear about your new product . __eou__ OK . I'm sure you will love what this new automatic answering system can do for your business . __eou__ Yes . I've heard a lot about it . __eou__ Watch our computer demonstration , please . You'll be convinced that our product is superior . ( After the demonstration ) __eou__ Yes , I would have to agree with you . It seems to offer more options than the others . But new product sometimes has a few troubles . How about yours ? __eou__ Our systems are 100 % trouble-free . __eou__ How do you ensure quality ? __eou__ Any of our new products shall go through a 1-3 month testing period . __eou__ Are your prices negotiable ? __eou__ Yes , our prices are negotiable , but our quality is not . __eou__ What happens if I am not satisfied with my purchases ? __eou__ Your satisfaction is guaranteed , or we refund your money . __eou__ I see . But I have to discuss it over with my boss before I make a decision . __eou__ OK . I hope you will be in touch with me shortly . __eou__
Daniel , have you ever heard about the wildlife sanctuary ? __eou__ Is that different from this kind of zoo ? __eou__ Yes , of course . __eou__ So tell me about it ! __eou__ There are a lot of wild animals in that place , and also some special rules while visiting . __eou__ Special rules ? __eou__ There , you only have two ways for visiting . __eou__ Details ? __eou__ On their bus or in your own cars , and you won't be allowed to get off the bus until you reach the special region . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Because it is dangerous to get out of the car or bus . You can just imagine how fierce the wild animals can be . __eou__ That makes sense . But that sounds interesting . Is there one in Beijing too ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I prefer to go there next time . __eou__ Yeah , sure , you won't be disappointed . __eou__
Have you heard about the new iPhone ? __eou__ yes , I heard it's supposed to come out in June . Are you thinking about getting one ? __eou__ I'd like to . It's a cell phone , camera , PAD and mp3 player all in one . __eou__ if I had enough money , I'd buy one , but I don't even have enough to buy one of their shuffle spods . __eou__ how big is a shuffle iPod ? __eou__ the first generation iPod shuffle is about the size of a park of gum and the second generation iPod shuffle is about half the size of the first . __eou__ how many gigs of music can it hold ? __eou__ I think it's either one or two gigs . I can't remember . __eou__ how much do they cost ? __eou__ not much at all . I think it's about 100 dollars . __eou__ you're right , that's not bad at all . __eou__ do you have an iPod ? __eou__ I got one for my birthday when they first came out , but after the battery died out , I never brought another one . __eou__ why didn't you just buy another battery for it so you could use it ? __eou__ that's one of the problems with having an iPod . Though an iPod might have an above average battery life , once the battery is dead , so is your iPod . __eou__
what are you looking for ? __eou__ I want to buy a new camcorder for my trip this summer . __eou__ do you know what camcorder options are available ? __eou__ not really . I thought I'd just have a look today . __eou__ would you like to look at the new digital camcorders that have just come in ? __eou__ sure . I'd like to see the smallest camcorder that you have first . __eou__ ok . This Sony model is their newest and our most popular camcorder . Why don't you see if you like the way it feel ? __eou__ it's very light . That would be good . How is the battery life ? __eou__ it's got an above-average battery life . It lasts up tp 12 hours and can be charged in 30 minutes . __eou__ can you also take still photos with this ? __eou__ yes , that is an option . __eou__ how about night vision ? Can you use it in the dark ? __eou__ yes . I can show you examples of some footages that was taken with this camera in the dark . __eou__ that's not bad at all . How's the microphone ? Does it pick up much sound ? __eou__ It can record any sound that's within about 8 feet of the camera . __eou__ how does that compare with other models ? __eou__ there are models that can pick up more sound than this one , but they're much bigger and heavier than this one . __eou__ I guess you can't have everything , can you ? __eou__
Hello , ma ’ am , can I help you find something ? __eou__ Yes , actually I ’ m looking to buy a camera . __eou__ We ’ Ve got a wide selection do you know if you ’ d like a point-and-shoot , or something a little fancier ? Are you shopping for yourself or for someone else ? __eou__ Actually I ’ m buying a camera for my husband . __eou__ Ah , well then I ’ d recommend a nice entry-level digital SLR . __eou__ Yeah ? Can I take a look at the Sirs you carry ? __eou__ Sure thing , follow me . This here is the . __eou__ The Canon Eos . Yeah it ’ s ok , but I ’ m looking for something that performs better in low light , has a better display panel , and longer battery life . __eou__ Oh , ah , um the Nikon D60 is a nice option . __eou__ Yeah , but what kit lens does this camera come with ? I don ’ t want some bulky telephoto lens . __eou__ Oh , well this one has the , uh . __eou__ Looks to me like an 18-55 mm lens . pretty standard , that will do . Not like my husband will be stalking celebrities or anything ! __eou__ So , ahem , can I interest you in any acc ... __eou__ Accessories ? Do you carry polarizing filters ? __eou__ Polarizing filter um we should ! I ’ m sorry , ma ’ am . It looks like we ’ re sold out . __eou__ No you ’ re not ! There are some right here ! __eou__ Oh , well , would you look at that ! Polarizing filters . __eou__ Thanks for your help , Ralph ! __eou__ No problem , ma ’ am . __eou__
Look at these clothes designed by top fashion designer like Versacci , Calvin Klein , and Vivienne Westwood . What do you think of them ? __eou__ Well , they look lovely , but they ’ re not very practical . I mean , would you wear that dress to the office or walking down the street ? __eou__ I know what you mean . People would stare at you in amazement if you wore something like that in an everyday situation . I suppose only extravagant rich people wear them at cocktail parties . __eou__ Maybe . I ’ m not sure why they have fashion shows like this . Hardly anyone will buy those clothes . The clothes you see are nothing like the ones that ordinary people wear . It seems like a waste of money . __eou__ I think that the designers hold these fashion shows for a few reasons . First , it ’ s just like a big party . They can meet each other and network . The other thing is that it is great advertising . All the journalists and photographers are there . Thirdly , it give them a chance to show what they would like to see people wearing . __eou__ You meant it ’ s an expression of their fantasies ? __eou__ Yes . I think the designers are saying that these clothes are what they would like to see people wear if those people weren ’ t concerned with what other people might think . In a way , the designers are saying ‘ don ’ t worry about what others think . Wear what you like ! ’ . __eou__ Very philosophical . I think they design these clothes more for publicity . They try to see who can be the most extreme and outrageous , but still stylish . __eou__ Come on . All this fashion has reminded me that I want to buy some clothes . __eou__
New York Airport.May I help you ? __eou__ Yes . I am calling to make sure if flight CG877 will arrive on time ? __eou__ Hold on a moment please ... Sorry , the flight from London has been delayed . It departed two hours later than scheduled.The whether in London was really bad . __eou__ You mean it will arrive two hours later than usual ? __eou__ So far we could only deduce this way.If you want further information , would you please call us 1 hour later ? __eou__ OK , thank you . __eou__
You want to go get a facial with me today ? __eou__ Dude , what are you talking about ? Only girls do that . __eou__ Not at all , guys also get facials , manicures and pedicures . There is nothing wrong with looking after your skin and looking good . __eou__ True . So what do they do to you at your beauty spa ? __eou__ Well , first they exfoliate my face , getting rid of all the dead skin . Then I get a face mask with nutrients that keep my skin healthy and young . Afterwards , they apply some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a million bucks . __eou__ That doesn't really sound like something I would be interested in . In any case , I just wash my face every night and use sunscreen during the day . __eou__ Well you should come with me one day , I'm sure you'll love it . __eou__ Uh ... no . __eou__
Judy , your husband has a really nice car . __eou__ Thanks . It's a lot better than mine , and it's new . __eou__ Where are you going ? __eou__ We're going to visit my sister in the city . __eou__ I didn't know your sister lives in the city , when did she move there ? __eou__ About a year ago . She lives in an apartment on 3rd street , across from the public library . __eou__ I see . It's almost 5:00 PM now , don't you think there will be a lot of traffic ? __eou__ Oh , we're not driving . We're going to take the subway . The subway only takes about 20 minutes . __eou__ Yes , but it can be very crowded around this time . I always feel uncomfortable taking the subway . __eou__ I take the subway to work everyday , so I'm used to it now . __eou__ Doesn't your mother live in the city ? __eou__ Yes , she's lived there for about ten years . __eou__ I remember when she moved there . Apartments were a lot cheaper then . __eou__ I know what you mean . It's hard to find anything that's reasonable now . __eou__ Have a good time . Next time you're free , give me a call and we'll go play poker . __eou__ See you later . __eou__
Well , how was your honeymoon ? __eou__ It was fantastic ! We had such a good time . The only problem was that because it was their high season , we spent hours queuing . __eou__ Peak periods always entail hours of queuing . At least you got a nice tan though ! __eou__ Yes , Florida had great weather while we were there . You look tan , too . Did you go somewhere ? __eou__ My friends and I just got back from Bali . __eou__ Wow ! Bali Islands have some of the best beaches in the world , don't they ? __eou__ Yes , we were lucky . My friend's father owns a resort on one of the islands , so we were able to stay for free . __eou__ Did you go diving while you were there ? __eou__ I took a few diving classes , but I didn't really like it , so I did snorkeling instead ! __eou__ Did you take any pictures in the ocean ? __eou__ I've got quite a few pictures of all different kinds of fish . I'll show them to you next time I see you . __eou__ Have you started planning your christmas vacation yet ? __eou__ We're planning on going skiing in Switzerland . Do you ski ? __eou__ No , but I do like snowboarding . __eou__ Would you like to go skiing with us for christmas ? __eou__ I'll talk to my husband about it ; I'm sure he'll say yes ! He loves Switzerland ! __eou__ It is Europe's spotless land of lakes and mountains ! Let me know as soon as you can so we can get a discount . __eou__
It's wonderful to be in the mountains after a hustle bustle week . __eou__ Indeed . I love the smell of the grass and trees . They certainly refresh my mind . __eou__ Can we stop here for a while ? My backpack is very heavy . __eou__ Sure . Did you hear anything ? Look ! An eagle is hovering in the sky . __eou__ Let me see . It's not an eagle . I think it's a vulture . __eou__ Yes . Will it hurt us ? __eou__ I don't think so . Let's walk by the stream . I am sure we can find the waterfall on the map . __eou__ OK . I have a good pair of hiking boots . It should not be a big problem . __eou__ I also brought a bottle of water and some provisions . If you are hungry , you can let me know . __eou__ You are kind . Look there is a big tree over there , it looks like a thousand-year-old tree . __eou__ Well , it is a birch tree.It is not as old as you think . __eou__ How do you know ? __eou__ Because its trunk is not thick enough to be like a thousand-year-old tree . __eou__
I have a little trouble , and I don't know how to deal with it . __eou__ What's the matter ? Please tell me . Maybe I can help you . __eou__ Tom wants me to write a recommendation letter for him , but I don't know how to write it . __eou__ Don't worry . I know about this . __eou__ Really ? Tell me without delay . __eou__ First you should have a salutation , which can be the company's or a person's name . __eou__ Well , I see . __eou__ Then you can write about his performance in college , including his academic achievements and his competence . __eou__ It's easy to write those . __eou__ You can also state his personality traits , hobbies and relationships with schoolmates and so on . __eou__ Tom got along well with classmates . He is really a good boy . __eou__ You can write all his strengths in the recommendation letter . __eou__ What should I write except these ? __eou__ You should also state that you are his class president , so you are qualified to write this recommendation letter __eou__ OK , I will remember . __eou__
He has a long head , I bet he will do well in his business . __eou__ He does , he started five years ago and now ends up the richest among us . __eou__ When we were students , he was no good in any subject . __eou__ It seemed to be useless to study well when we were young if we examine his case . __eou__
Hello . I was wondering if Taylor Smith has checked out yet ? __eou__ Just one moment . I'll check with the cancer ward desk . __eou__ The cancer ward ! ? Oh , my . It's worse than we thought . __eou__ Ma'am , I'm sorry . The cancer ward said Mr . Smith passed away two days ago . __eou__ That's impossible ! I'm talking about Mister Taylor Smith . __eou__ Yes , ma'am . He died from complications of stomach cancer . I'm very sorry . __eou__ I'm really sick ! __eou__
Judy , have you ever made out how much money shall we spend ? __eou__ Oh , yeah . The total amount is no less than 13,000 RIB , according to our itinerary . __eou__ What ? That's too much . __eou__ Sit down . I'll show you the list of our financial budget . First of all , it is nearly 4,000 RIB that we should spend in transportation . __eou__ Ah , the transportation fee always takes a great part in the budget . __eou__ Then we must pay a large amount of money for the hotel . But if we want to save money , we can choose a hotel which is not so good . __eou__ Hmm , what I'm fearful of is that the accommodation will also deteriorate once we choose a cheaper hotel . __eou__ In that case , we can choose the Youth Hotel . It's a good choice , clean and economic . __eou__
Mrs . Schmidt ! What's happening ! __eou__ You'll never guess what happened today ! I went to the doctor after work and the doctor told me ... __eou__ And the doctor told you to start listening to Bach ? __eou__ No ...

They say listening to classical music can make your baby smarter ! __eou__

But Vince already said no . __eou__
Today more and more people advocate lifelong learning . But people have different views about lifelong learning . How do you understand lifelong learning ? __eou__ I think lifelong learning is the concept that it's never too soon or too late for learning __eou__ Does that mean studying all the time ? __eou__ I don't think so . I think it's about your attitude towards learning . One should be open to new ideas , decisions , skills or behaviors . __eou__ Then the axiom - ' You can't teach an old dog new tricks ' doesn't work any longer . __eou__ You're right .

Why is that ? __eou__ Till I moved out of my parents ’ home , I became a lot more independent . __eou__ What would you say was the lowest point in your life ? __eou__ That would definitely be getting a divorce . __eou__ What went wrong ? __eou__ We just weren't right for each other . __eou__ How long were you married ? __eou__ The marriage only lasted about a year . __eou__ Have you remarried since then ? __eou__ Yes , I got married to a man that I met shortly after I divorced my first husband . __eou__ Do you think you'll ever get a divorce again ? __eou__ Oh I hope not , my first marriage was a mistake , but this one isn ’ t . __eou__ How long have you been married ? __eou__ About 15 years now . __eou__ Do you think you'll still love him when he is old and gray ? __eou__ I think so , hopefully we ’ ll have a long and a happy life together . __eou__ I ’ m sure you will . __eou__
Madam , I made a close study of the draft contract yesterday evening . I think there are something needs to modify . __eou__ Which terms ? __eou__ First , about the terms of payment . Your draft contract says that payment is to be made by D \ A . This is not our practice . We prefer to have the payment made by L \ C through a negotiating bank in America . __eou__ Good . I will add this to the contract . __eou__ The second thing I would like to point out , that is packaging . It's stipulated in the contract that all the computer parts should be packed in cardboard boxes . But I think the wooden cases are much safer . __eou__ Well , you are right . Is there anything else ? __eou__ As far as the contract stipulations are concerned , there is nothing more . Thank you very much . __eou__ Well , we have agreed on all the major points . __eou__

It rained cats and dogs last night , but cleared up in the morning . __eou__ I was worried about canceling the climbing . __eou__ Honey , wait for me . I am too tired to move a step further . __eou__ What about taking the cable car ? __eou__ Attaboy , that's just what I am thinking . __eou__ Wow , What a long queue this is ! __eou__ Honey , be patient . It's better to wait than to climb with my legs broken . __eou__ Daddy , look ahead in the distance , the mountains there . They roll all the way up to the sky . __eou__ Yeah , the scenery is beautiful . What's more , the air is fresh here ? __eou__ So you wanna stay here ? __eou__ Of course not , I have to watch my American Idol . __eou__
I see that there are Olympic mascots in your car . __eou__ Yes . I am very interested in the Olympic Games , and I'm especially excited about 2008 Beijing Olympics . __eou__ Me , too . I want to be a volunteer for 2008 Beijing Olympics . __eou__ That's cool . Care for a little quiz on that ? __eou__ No problem . I'm an ' Olympic expert ' . __eou__ Wow , you've talked the talk . Now it's time to walk the walk . Here we go . First , can you tell me something about the ancient Olympics ? __eou__ The ancient Olympics originated in ancient Greece . __eou__ Good . Why do people name it Olympics ? __eou__ They name it after the place where it was first held . __eou__ Who started the modern Olympics ? __eou__ This question is a piece of cake . A Frenchman named Baron de Coubertin . __eou__ What did people call him ? __eou__ Of course he was called ' the father of the Olympics ' . __eou__ What did he do for restoring the Olympics ? __eou__ He once made a speech on the ‘ Renaissance of the Olympics ' . __eou__ Well , that's for all .

The summers are so great here ! Not hot at all . I love the cooling breezes , the clear air , all the greenery . __eou__ This really has been a wonderful holiday for us . Shall we take a walk around the pond or into those woods for a while ? __eou__ Let's do both ! Are we in a rush or anything __eou__ No , not really . I had thought we'd stay in Hamburg tonight , but we can't unless we rush it . Let's stay in Bremen instead . Tomorrow we can have lunch in Hamburg , then check into a hostel in Copenhagen and have dinner there . __eou__ Sounds fine to me . Whatever , let's enjoy this pond first . __eou__ Sure . We can walk around to that path that leads into the woods there . Hey , look ! There are some wild ducks over there in the reeds . __eou__ I see them ! Wow ! How do you know they're wild ? __eou__ I used to go hunting with my uncle , that's how . __eou__ They're neat . Now Let's take that path into the woods and see what we can see ... __eou__
What is the movie you saw last night ? __eou__ It is a new film , ' Transformer ' . __eou__ How do you like it ? __eou__ I expected too high from that movie , but I was a bit disappointed about it . __eou__ But I heard the box office rose up to 15 million in the first week . __eou__ Box office can't explain everything . I do not think it is cheerful or well-made . The plot is old and the female character is not pretty . __eou__ My sister has given me two tickets for tonight . It is called ' The life of Rose ' , a French movie . __eou__ What's it about ? __eou__ It tells the lifetime of a lady singer from a beggar in the street to a famous singer in the world . It is a kind of tragedy . __eou__ I prefer the tragedy . It is moving and makes me ponder about my life . __eou__ Let's go . The time is coming . __eou__ We can buy the popcorn before entering the cinema . __eou__
Did your company go union ? I heard that many companies in out industry are being unionized , so It's getting harder and harder to compete on a level playing field . __eou__ Yes , we're hopping on the bandwagon and signing up for the union . Mostly people are pretty happy about it ... I guess it depends on if you are in management or in the labor force . __eou__ Management isn't looking on the labor unions too favorably , I'd guess . I don't blame them ... labor unions can really put the squeeze on the executives . __eou__ Sure ... but it's probably better for the workers , because the union's whole purpose is to look out for the little guys . The only way that the little guys can take on the big bosses is if they unite . Labor unions are all about getting a voice for the underdog . __eou__
What do you think is the role teacher should play in the classroom ? __eou__ Teachers are just directors who give scope to the students ' initiative and creativeness , instead of taking their rights away from speaking . __eou__ What did you do to put it into practice ? __eou__ I divided students into groups and asked them to generate their own ideas actively . It can help develop the problem-solving ability of the students . __eou__
You know that this job requires frequent business travel . Can you accept it ? __eou__ Yes , I can . __eou__ Mostly short business trips , but sometimes long ones are also needed . __eou__ Then how about the expenses during the trips ? __eou__ The company will pay all the expenses . __eou__ Would you tell me where we often travel ? __eou__ Usually Shanghai , Qingdao , Hong Kong and so on . __eou__ It's great ! I like these places . __eou__ And you need to go abroad once in a while . Can you ? __eou__ Yes , I can . __eou__ After the business trip , you could apply for reimbursement of all the expenses , such as passage money and accommodation charges and so on . __eou__ I see . __eou__ You can take a break for one or two weeks after you have a business trip every time , which depends on the circumstances . __eou__ OK .

I have an interview today with Dale Mendoza . Do you know her ? __eou__ Yeah , I know her pretty well . __eou__ To tell you the truth , I'm really nervous .

Mendoza won't be able to hear my teeth chattering . I just hope I get through this in one piece . __eou__
Can you be serious for a moment , we've been dating for 6 months now , I really like you . I'd like to take a relationship to the next level . __eou__ So what are you trying to say to me ? __eou__ It feels like you are not dedicate to our relationship . It seems like you treat it as a just casual dating . __eou__ How should I say it ? __eou__ I don't want to be like this . I think we should get step further . __eou__ It has only been 6 months , our relationship hasn't had a chance to maturate . We are still have some hurdle we have to jump over . __eou__ Like what ? __eou__ Last week I saw Brain kissing you on the cheek . __eou__ It was only the cheek . __eou__ That is ok , then ? Starts on the cheek ? pretty soon you french kiss in the back on his car . __eou__ Oh , that is ridiculous . __eou__ So is it ok if I kiss other women on the cheek ? __eou__ Definitely not . __eou__ You see , we still have hurdle . __eou__
Could you tell me something about the Mid-Autumn Festival ? I find it also very interesting . __eou__ OK . It falls on the 15th day of the eighth lunar month . It is said that there is a beautiful goddess Chang'E on the moon who had eaten some sort of elixir and had to depart her husband . She is always expecting to see her husband again . So , later we have the traditional idea that when there is the full moon , it is time for the family members to come together . __eou__ So , I understand why people eat moon cakes on that day . __eou__ You are right . In China , ' round ' is an auspicious word . The moon cakes are in round shape . __eou__ Is it official ? __eou__ It was not in the past . But from 2008 , we can enjoy a three-day holiday for this festival . __eou__
Every country should face the history . __eou__ Yeah , we don ’ t live in the vacuum . We have traditional values and long but different history . __eou__ Sometimes , we , human beings , really had done something wrong , so we should admit it at first . __eou__ But there is always somebody who wants to turn his back on the true history . __eou__ I believe such things won ’ t be realized , just daydreaming . __eou__
Do you believe in UFOs ? __eou__ Of course , they are out there . __eou__ But I never saw them . __eou__ Are you stupid ? They are called UFOs , so not everybody can see them . __eou__ You mean that you can them . __eou__ That's right . I can see them in my dreams . __eou__ They come to the earth ? __eou__ No . Their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space . __eou__ Aliens from the outer space ? Do you talk to them ? What do they look like ? __eou__ OK , OK , one by one , please ! They look like robots , but they can speak . Their mission is to make friends with human beings . __eou__ That means that you talk to them ? In which language ? __eou__ Of course in English , they learn English on Mars too . __eou__ Wow . Sounds fantastic ! __eou__
Do you hear what happened to Sally ? __eou__ No , what ? __eou__ She had to go to the hospital . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ She passed out in class . Seems she hadn't eaten anything in days . __eou__ Why on earth would she do that ? You mean that she intentionally did not eat any food for days ? That's crazy ! __eou__ Yeah , but that's what she did . __eou__ I can't believe that there are girls who are willing to do that to their bodies . And all for a certain look . __eou__ Well , it's not just the girl ’ s fault . It's also society's fault - magazines and ads that show - thin models all saying , It's in to be thin . It's hard for them not to listen . __eou__ True , but there are limits . Being thin is one thing ; starving oneself to death is another . No one forces them to do this . __eou__
I ’ m looking for a budget hotel in Orlando . Have you ever stayed at the Comfort Hotel ? __eou__ Yes ... I wouldn ’ t recommend it . __eou__ Why not ? __eou__ Granted , it ’ s cheap , but the place is filthy , the beds are uncomfortable , there ’ s no A / C , the breakfast is pretty skimpy ... and the staff couldn ’ t care less about the guests . __eou__ Oh . I guess you get what you pay for . How long did you stay there ? __eou__ Just one night , when my flight was canceled due to bad weather . It ’ s bearable if you just need a place to crash , but you definitely don ’ t want to book a vacation there . Unless you enjoy sharing your room with cockroaches . __eou__ Hmm , I ’ ll pass . Hopefully I can find a decent place that won ’ t cost a fortune . __eou__
My , it looks too queer ! __eou__ Yes , it is a queer drug , a tonic only available in China . Many ancient Chinese medicine journals have recorded that it can cure such ailments as night sweat , pain at loins and knees and anaemia . It has no side effect . __eou__ Great ! Will you please tell me how to take it ? __eou__ Yes , madam . Fill 3 or 5 pieces of Cordyceps into a cleaned and chopped open duck's head and cook with the whole duck . Or stew Cordyceps with chicken . __eou__ That sounds very interesting ! __eou__ Please don't eat turnip and garlic when taking this medicine . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__
How are your Chinese and English ? __eou__ I can confidently say that my Chinese and English are pretty good . I won prizes in many speech contests in both Chinese and English . __eou__ How would you consider your salary if you succeed in becoming a translator in our company ? __eou__ I believe every company has its own salary criterion . And you will give me a satisfying salary according to my abilities and performances . __eou__
We're going to discuss how to market CB series soon . Does your project go well ? __eou__ Absolutely . I've sorted out all the materials we need and sifted three great ways of marketing . __eou__ Oh , that's good . __eou__ We can discuss them detailedly over the meeting and choose the best way to promote our key products . __eou__ It seems you've got everything done . Now I can finally stop worrying about it and get back to work . __eou__
Your dog is really cute . What's his name ? __eou__ His name is Bingo . __eou__ What kind of dog is he ? __eou__ We're not sure because the neighbour gave him to us after they moved away . __eou__ Well , he sure likes to run around a lot . Is he well behaved ? __eou__ Oh yes , he is . When he was a puppy , he liked to chew my father's shoes , but he's okay now . __eou__ That sounds like my cat . She likes to scratch the couch with her claws . __eou__ I didn't know you had a cat . When did you get her ? __eou__ About a year ago actually . You've probably never seen her though . __eou__ Really ? Why is that ? __eou__ She's not a house-cat . She stays outside most of the time . __eou__ Bingo could never do that . He stays in the house except when we take him to the park . __eou__
What can I do for you , young man ? __eou__ I need to rent three pairs of skates for the morning . __eou__ What sizes do you need ? __eou__ One pair of 37 , and two pairs of 21 . One for me , and the other two for two kids . __eou__ Here you are . And here are three crash helmets . __eou__ Thanks . Well , those two kids are beginners . What should I do about their safety ? __eou__ Well , there are a lot to do , but nothing to worry about . First , make sure they don't go far from the railings . __eou__ Oh , yeah , maybe I should ask them just to walk along the railings . __eou__ That's a good idea . And remind them to be slow at the beginning , not to run into the railings . __eou__ OK . Anything else ? __eou__ Never go to the center of the lake . The ice there is too thin to skate on . __eou__ Got it . Thanks for reminding me . And , are there any intensive training courses ? __eou__
Didn't you say you were planning a trip to China ? I heard the northwest and north of China are experiencing severe sandstorms ! __eou__ I was planning to go to Beijing first and then go to northwest China ! Looks like I'm in trouble . __eou__ Definitely . I heard Beijing was experiencing seven degree strong winds ! That is nearly a record high ! __eou__ No way ! I don't think I've ever encountered winds that strong ! Are the storms affecting land and air transportation ? __eou__ Absolutely ! I don't think any planes are going anywhere . The sand being blown around has cut visibility in Beijing to less than 100 meters . But inseems Gansu Province is being hit the hardest . __eou__ That's exactly where I was planning to go ! __eou__ Well , this storm originated in the plateaus in northwest China . At the moment , that area is calmer . __eou__

Let's do it slowly and correctly . __eou__ Oh , Mom , I think I'm not the right person for swimming . __eou__ Come on , sweetie , you've done very well . It is the first step that is tough . __eou__ Right , I'll make up my mind . Please correct me if any of my movements go wrong . __eou__ Yes , well done . That's the way to go . How clever you are ! You've got it . __eou__ Really ? I can't believe it . Everything is possible to a willing heart . __eou__ Exactly , next , you should hold your legs together and extend your arms above your head . __eou__ Yes , like a dolphin . Am I on the right track ? __eou__ That's the way to go . Now , you are flying , my boy . __eou__
What do you say we stop in at that Burger King over there and grab a bite ? __eou__ Forget it ! If you think I ’ d ever set foot that inferior restaurant again , you gotta be nuts . Last time I ate that food , almost vomited . The service in there is terrible . It was the first time I ever stiffed a waiter __eou__ Yeah , not seeing a single person anywhere informed me . Hey ! How about that one over there ? __eou__ Oh , give me a break ! That place is too lavish for us . __eou__ Easy . It ’ s on me . __eou__ In that case , I ’ m right behind you . __eou__
Mike , what are you doing tonight ? __eou__ Nothing special . I just want to get plastered . __eou__ I don't feel like drinking tonight . I'm gonna hang out at YY's . __eou__ YY's ? That place is boring . How about Xara's ? It's real classy , and they keep the place spin and span . __eou__ Yeah , but it's expensive . Nah , I'm going to YY's . __eou__ On second thought , I think I'll join you . __eou__ They ' Ve just renovated the place . You may be surprised . __eou__ Wow , they really went to town on this place ! __eou__ Quite a difference , huh ? __eou__ Sure is . Waiter , bring us two drafts , please . __eou__ Ah hah.Thought you were't drinking . __eou__ When in Rome , do as the Romans do . __eou__
How are you feeling ? __eou__ Bad . My nose keeps running . And my forehead is burning . __eou__ You said you never went to hospital . __eou__ I will get better soon . __eou__ The good thing is you don't need to go to school . __eou__ Yeah , I love that , no class , no homework , and no exams . __eou__ And your Mom and Dad will buy you anything you ask for . __eou__ Haha , I just got the Ultraman costume . My Dad bought it . __eou__ I really envy you , Danny . __eou__ Come on , I got numerous shots for that . You have no idea what I've been through with the needles . __eou__ Your sister said you fainted three times during the injection . __eou__ May told you ? Oh , May , she's such a tattletale . __eou__ No matter what , you are still my hero , Daniel . __eou__ Tom , promise me to keep this a secret , will you ? __eou__ OK , I promise . You promise you will be well soon ? __eou__ Deal . __eou__
Is your application successful ? __eou__ Yes , they notify me to work next week . __eou__ Where on earth will you work in ? __eou__ It is a pretty big mechanical company . I am assigned to work in the assembly shop . __eou__ How long will you work a day ? __eou__ My working hours aren ’ t fixed , sometimes I do the day shift , sometimes the night shift . In all , about 8 hours . __eou__ That ’ s rather hard . __eou__ But it matches my major . __eou__ How will you get your pay ? __eou__ My wage depends on production results . __eou__ What sort of welfare facilities does your company provide ? __eou__ The company provides labor insurance for all employees , as well as fine retirement policy . __eou__ Is there a union ? __eou__ There is the company union , but it really shares the same aims as the management . __eou__ So you must consider dearly before you go to work . __eou__ I will . __eou__
We need someone rather quickly , the sooner the better . __eou__ Can I ask what the position pays ? __eou__ Well , of course depends somewhat on experience , background and that sort of thing . What are your currently earning ? __eou__ My current salary is in the range of fifty thousand yuan . __eou__ I see . Including bonus ? __eou__ Yes , but not including overtime pay . I'm looking for a salary slightly higher than my present one , with opportunities for raises if I work well . __eou__ What starting salary would you expect here ? __eou__ I have to support my parents who are advanced in age , so I'd like to commence at HAD 2,500 a month . __eou__
Are you free next thursday ? __eou__ Yeah , why , is there something going on Thursday ? __eou__ A bunch of us in the office are planning a retiring party for Bob , he's been with the office for ages , so everyone was really surprised to hear he took early retirement . __eou__ Bob is retiring , wow ... that's news to me , I had no idea Bob was that old , retirement's still sixty-five , right ? __eou__ Retirement age is still 65 , but I think more and more people are retiring earlier , I think Bob's in upper fifties already , he just looks pretty young . __eou__ Wow ... I thought he was early forty stops , why would he want to retire so soon ? __eou__ Well , I think you prepare it well and capture good savings , retiring early can give you a lot more time for travel and other activities , you should get out and enjoy the life you still can't , don't you think ? __eou__
Amelia , could you spare a few minutes ? __eou__ sure . What do you need ? __eou__ well , I wanted to let you know that I've put in my notice . __eou__ really ? Why ? __eou__ it's complicated . But basically it boils down to one thing . This company is downsizing and I can't continue working for a company that may let me go . __eou__ but surely they won't fire you ! You're one of the most experienced managers here ! __eou__ well , to be honest , there's another reason . I've got a better offer . __eou__ well that's great news ! Congratulations ! Where will you be located ? __eou__ the head office is in New York , but I'll be dealing with overseas companies and flying to this side of the world from time to time . __eou__ it'll be sad to see you go , but it sounds like you're found yourself a great opportunity . __eou__ I have . I feel lucky . I look forward to dealing with overseas companies and at the same time having a chance to use English more . __eou__ I'm sorry to bring this up , but would it be possible for you to write me a letter of recommendation before you go ? __eou__ of course I can . In fact , if there are other job opportunities at this new company , I'll recommend you personally . __eou__ thanks . I appreciate that . __eou__
Can I help you ? __eou__ I'd like to buy some Chinese-style cakes . Could you recommend me some ? __eou__ Certainly . What about moon cake ? It's typical Chinese food . __eou__ Moon cakes ? What is that ? __eou__ The moon cake is round and looks like the full moon . That's why it's called the moon cake and the moon cake symbolizes family reunion and harmony . __eou__ Sounds very interesting . I'll buy some to family people . __eou__ All the moon cakes are generally classified into two styles , Cantonese style and Suzhou style . __eou__ What's the difference between these two styles ? __eou__ The skin of Cantonese style cakes is soft and puffy with heavy stuffing while the skin of Suzhou style cakes is puffy filled with fragrant nuts . __eou__ Get me some of each . __eou__ OK , here you are . __eou__
are you good at cooking ? __eou__ no , but I'm pretty good at eating ! __eou__ do you prefer chinese food or Western food ? __eou__ well , to be honest with you , Chinese food is really different from western food . __eou__ are you used to the food here ? __eou__ I'm not really used to it yet . __eou__ what's your favorite Chinese dish ? __eou__ like most foreigners , I really like Sweet and Sour Pork and Kung Pao Chicken . I eat them almost every day . __eou__ have you tried traditional Chinese dumplings yet ? __eou__ I tried once , but they are quite difficult to eat with chopsticks . __eou__ you know , foreigners are not expected to use chopsticks proficiently . If you do , you'll give your Chinese friends quite an impression . __eou__ that's good to know . I'd like to try more Chinese food , but since I can't read any of the menus in the restaurants near my home , it's difficult to try new food . __eou__ if you want , I can introduce you to some typical Chinese dishes . __eou__ that would be great . I really only want to taste real Chinese food , not just the food that foreigners like to eat ! __eou__ if you haven't tried Beijing duck yet , I'd like to treat you to a meal at a famous duck restaurant near Qianmen . It would be a pity if you left without tasting it ! __eou__
Morgan , can I ask you a question ? __eou__ sure , what is it ? __eou__ I was just wondering if many Chinese people take their leftover food home from a restaurant . __eou__ in most cities in China , doggie bags are quite uncommon . __eou__ what happen to all the leftover food ? __eou__ it usually goes to the dump . __eou__ that seems like an awful waste ! Why don't people order fewer dishes so that they don't have to throw so much away at the end of the meal ? __eou__ ordering a lot of food at restaurants is just a tradition in China . You know , in the past , people could not afford to eat out like they can today . __eou__ I guess that makes sense . I just think it would make more sense to take the leftovers home . __eou__ well , if you want , you can take the leftovers home . __eou__ no , that's OK . You know what they say when in Rome ... __eou__ I was impressed that you tried the pig's feet . I heard that many foreigners don't like to eat them . __eou__ many people in my generation don't eat pig's feet , but my parents grew up eating them , so I think they are OK . __eou__ did you like them ? You could take the last one home with you . __eou__ that's OK . I'll try anything once , but sometimes , once is enough ! __eou__

I'd take the chopsticks . __eou__ Yes , hope you like it . Do you need beer or wine ? __eou__ Beer , please . Oh , there are so many dishes . __eou__ I'm glad you like them .. . We'd appreciate your kind consideration in the coming negotiation . Let's drink to our friendship . __eou__ Let's hope for good cooperation between us . __eou__

What can I do for you ? __eou__ if you have a few minutes , I'd like to talk to you about my future at this company . __eou__ sure , have a seat . __eou__ thanks . __eou__ let me just grab your file . How long have you worked for us now ? __eou__ I've worked here as a sales representative for about a year now . __eou__ one year already ? It's amazing how time flies like that . Are you enjoying your job ? __eou__ yes , but I'd like to have a chance at job advancement . __eou__ I see . What job did you have in mind . __eou__ well , I've noticed that is a position available as a sales manager . __eou__ do you understand what duties that job would entail ? __eou__ yes . I would be directly responsible for all of the sales representatives in my department . I assume there'd be more meetings , paperwork , and other responsibilities , too . __eou__ that's right . Do you have any experience in management ? __eou__ yes . In fact if you look at my resume , you can see that I was a manager before I started this job . __eou__ well , I think you'd be the perfect candidate for the position . According to company policy , you'll still have to go through the formal application procedures though , so fill this application form in __eou__ ok . Thanks for your support . __eou__
