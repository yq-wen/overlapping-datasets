You must be Mr.Sellers . I'm Steven . I am here to see the apartment you advertised . __eou__ Oh , nice to see you . The apartment is on the tenth floor . The previous tenant just moved out yesterday . __eou__ Could I have a look at it first ? __eou__ Sure . Let me show you the way . Here we are . Apartment 1008 . ( They enter . ) This is the living room dining room combination . Here's the kitchen . It's small , but fully equipped . The refrigerator is new , and the stove and the microwave oven are less than a year old . __eou__ It's nice . So this is the bathroom . And that must be the bedroom . __eou__ Yes . And there's a walk-in closet . __eou__ Is there air conditioning ? __eou__ Yes , there's central air conditioning and heating . The thermostat is in the living room 。 __eou__ What's the house rent ? When is the rent due ? And how much security deposit do you require ? __eou__ It's 600 yuan per month.The rent is due no later than the tenth of the month . We ask that you leave a month's rent as a deposit . It will be returned to you at the end of your lease . __eou__ I like the apartment , Mr.Sellers . You can show me the lease . __eou__
I'm done . Can I watch TV ? __eou__ Here's some water . Take these multi-vitamins and Tylenol . __eou__ Uh ! I can't swallow them , Mom ! __eou__ Your throat must be swollen . __eou__ Do I have to take them ? __eou__ Here , I'll break them up , so they're smaller . And here's some cough syrup . __eou__ Yuck ! __eou__ I know , it tastes horrible . But it'll make you feel better . Try holding your nose . It won't taste as bad . __eou__
Hello , jewelry department . How may I help you ? __eou__ It's me , Ali . There's this strange guy who keeps coming around . He's been here three times this week . __eou__ He's probably a pervert . Just ignore him . __eou__ He makes me nervous . He looks at me funny . And he never buys anything ! __eou__ Maybe he wants to get something for his girlfriend , but he's embarrassed . __eou__
Hey , you , pick up that piece of garbage ! __eou__ Huh ? Me ? __eou__ Yeah , you . I just saw you throw a piece of garbage on the ground . Can't you read the No Littering sign ? It's a $ 500 penalty for littering , so go pick it up and put it in the garbage can over there . __eou__ Why should I do that ? It's only a piece of garbage . Why should you care ? __eou__ Because this is a public place , and I want to spend my time here without having to look at your garbage . __eou__ Listen , I really don't know why you're making this into such a big issue . It's only a small piece of garbage in a large space . It's not like there's garbage everywhere . Besides , someone will come along to clean it up at some time or another . __eou__ It's not the cleaner's responsibility to pick up after lazy people . It's part of your responsibility to make sure that the place is neat for other people . If everyone thought like you , there'd be garbage everywhere ! The cleaners can't be everywhere ! __eou__ Ok , whatever . See , I'm putting it in the garbage can . __eou__ Hold on , that's an item . You should put that in the recycle bin next to the trashcan . __eou__
it seems the department still has some money left in the budget . Do you have any suggestions how to use it before the budget is renewed ? __eou__ what about renting a restaurant and treating the employees to a nice dinner ? __eou__ but we've done that many times . We want something fresh this time . __eou__ okay , let me think . What about a party-and-movie night ? We can rearrange our reference room , invite a band to play some music , order in some food and watch a movie later . __eou__ sounds like a good idea , but a band sounds too expensive . __eou__ well , we can ask people to make small contributions . __eou__ I don ' t think so . I don't think people are going to like it if they have to pay to come . But we certainly can cut costs in other ways , such as make the party BYOB . __eou__ BYOB ? What's that ? __eou__ bring your own beverage . We can provide food , but people have to bring their own drinks . __eou__ so we're just going to have a party where they bring their own drinks and we just give them some snacks ? I don't know how well that will go over . __eou__ maybe you have a point . How about having a party on a Friday afternoon ? We'll stop early , order some pizza , and serve drinks . There'll be music but no band . Having the party in the office will make __eou__ oh , that sounds like fun ! __eou__
I think you are an excellent person . Honestly speaking , you are very suitable for this job __eou__ Thank you very much for your evaluation . I also like this job very much . __eou__ I want to know your earliest available entry time . __eou__ Oh , let me think ... Maybe two months later . __eou__ It's too late . If you could get the job , could you start a little earlier ? __eou__ I'm sorry I can't , because I haven't finished my thesis . __eou__ What a pity ! __eou__ When do you usually require the new employee to start ? __eou__ Within two weeks , because the new employees need to receive induction training . __eou__ I will make an arrangement for it . __eou__ I hope you can come to our company to work . __eou__ I will give you an exact reply as soon as possible . __eou__ OK , I will keep this position for you for one week . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__
Well , Mr . Brown , we've settled everything in connection with this transaction except the question of payment in yen . Now can you explain to me how to make payment in yen ? __eou__ Many of our business friends in England , France , Switzerland , Italy and Germany are paying for our exports in Japan currency . It is quite easy to do so . __eou__ I know some of them are doing that . But this is new to me . I've never made payment in yen before . It is convenient to make payment in pound sterling , but I may have some difficulty in making payment in yen . __eou__ Many banks in Europe now carry accounts in yen . They are in a position to open letters of credit and effect payment in yen . Consult your banks and you'll see that they are ready to offer you this service . __eou__ Do you mean to say that I can open a letter of credit in yen with a bank in London or Bonn ? __eou__ Sure you can . Several of the banks in London , such as the National Westminster Bank and Barclays Bank are in a position to open letters of credit in yen . They'll do so against our sales confirmation or contract . __eou__ I see . __eou__
Would you like to go to work or continue your studies after graduation ? __eou__ I think I will continue my studies . Now it's not easy for a graduate with bachelor's degree to get a job since there are so many graduates with master's or doctor's degree . We are likely to lose in competing with them in the job market . __eou__ So you will continue to study for a master's degree ? __eou__ Well , I think so . But I am thinking of going aboard to get a master's and doctor's degree . If can get a Ph . D . abroad , it will be much easy for me to get a job at home . __eou__ How can you finance your education abroad ? It is very expensive to study abroad . __eou__ I think I will try to get the scholarship since I really don't have so much money to study abroad . Actually now I am preparing for the TEFL and GRE exams . If I can get high marks in the two exams and if I am lucky enough , I may get a scholarship . __eou__ It could be pretty tough studying abroad . Being so far away from home ... __eou__
Do you know something about Mount Tai ? __eou__ Yes . But not too much . It is considered as the head of five sacred mountains in China . __eou__ Five sacred mountains ? Why people call them so ? __eou__ Because in history , the Chinese emperors used to climb onto these mountains and pay tribute to their ancestors and pray for good harvest and prosperity for the whole nation . __eou__ Got it . Can we see any things left by them ? __eou__ Definitely . There are many wall paintings and inscriptions on the huge rocks on the mountain . __eou__ I want to see them . How can I go there ? __eou__ That is easy . You can go directly to Tai'an city and buy a ticket to Mount Tai . __eou__
My mom is three years older than my dad , and they are like night and day.My mom is 5 footsweet and very nice , and very caring , and very cute , everybody tells her how young she looks , and how she resembles my sister , perhaps.My father is very much completely opposite that.He is a very bi 4 , on a good day , 5 foot 2 , I think in real life , and she is very nice . __eou__ When is the last time you talked to you parents ? __eou__ I talked to them probably about two weeks ago . Yeah , everything is going well . __eou__ Are you going to see them soon ? __eou__ I am going to go home after the holidays and we're going to have a Christmas kind of in January or February . Yeah , depending on when my brother can come in . __eou__ OK . And who are you more like , your mother or your father ? __eou__ I think I have traits of both , actually . I look more like my mother . __eou__
We've got a new manager in our department . __eou__ Oh ? You hoped to get that job , didn't you ? __eou__ Yes , I did . __eou__ I'm sorry . That's too bad . Who is it ? Who got the job , I mean ? __eou__ Someone called Drexler . Carl Drexler . He's been with the company onlytwo years . I've been here longer . And I know more about the job , too __eou__ Hmm . Why do you think they gave it to him and not to you ? __eou__ Because I'm the wrong sex , of course ! __eou__ You mean you didn't get the job because you're a woman ? __eou__ Yes , that was probably it ! It isn't fair . __eou__ What sort of clothes does he wear ? __eou__ A dark suit . White shirt . A tie . Why ? __eou__ Perhaps that had something to do with it . __eou__ You mean you think I didn't get the job because I come to work in jeansand a sweater ? __eou__ It's possible , isn't it ? __eou__ Do you really think I should wear different clothes ? __eou__ Well . . . perhaps you should think about it . __eou__ Why should I wear a skirt ? Or a dress ? __eou__ I'm not saying you should . I'm saying you should think about it . That's all ! __eou__ Why should I do that ? I'm good at my job ! That's the only important thing ! __eou__ Hmm . Perhaps it should be the only important thing . But it isn't . Not in this company . __eou__
What's your plan for your future ? __eou__ I'd like to work in a law firm to enrich my experience and put what I've learned into practice . __eou__ Have you had any previous experience ? __eou__ Well . During the college years , I worked as a trainee every summer at lawyer's offices . Does that count ? __eou__ Of course it counts . What kind of work did you do there ? __eou__ I did clerical stuff and ran errands . __eou__ In this office , we encourage full attendance by offering a bonus . If you take any leaves , we'll deduct money from your salary . __eou__ May I know about the office hours ? __eou__ Office hours are nine to five-thirty . One hour for lunch . Do you have any questions ? __eou__ Er , may I know how much I will be paid monthly ? __eou__ We'll give you about 3000 to start . There'll be a trial period of three month . After six months , we'll have a job performance review and consider giving you a raise . __eou__ When will I know your decision ? __eou__ I'll call you in a day or two , did you write down your phone number on your resume ? __eou__ Yes , I did . Can you call after 7 p . m . ? I'm usually out in the daytime . __eou__ All right . Good-bye . __eou__ Good-bye . __eou__
Are you familiar with American-styled accounting ? __eou__ I am afraid not . I haven't worked in an American company so far . __eou__ What are the most fundamental concepts underlying the accounting process ? __eou__ The first is accounting entity , and the second is going concern . The third is measuring unit . The fourth is accounting period , and the fifth is objectivity . __eou__
How many undergraduates are hired here each year ? __eou__ Normally , about 60 people . But it may depend . __eou__ I see . What kind of backgrounds does the staff have ? __eou__ About 20 % of them come from other countries and the others are employed from domestic universities and colleges . __eou__
We are going to need confirmation on these orders today , and delivery must be made before next Tuesday . Do you think you can handle that ? __eou__ We are willing to work with you , but do you think it would be possible to extend your confirmation deadline ? We need to check the warehouse to make sure the products are in stock . The earliest I will be to get back to you is tomorrow morning . __eou__ No , I must know today because we have to go to press for the advertisements . Is there anyway you can speed up the process of checking inventory ? __eou__ We can do that , but it will cost ... If we have to check our inventory with all our guys on overtime , you're looking at an increased cost of , I'd say , maybe 10 % . __eou__ Are you kidding ? __eou__ No , and let me tell you why ... If I make my guys stay over to check the inventory , I'll have to pay them at an overtime rate , which is time and a half . I estimate it will probably take 3 guys two hours to finish , that will be an increase on your labor fee by at least 10 % ... if you need the numbers that urgently , I can have them do it . Otherwise , we can wait until tomorrow morning , and I'll call you with the numbers after they're done . It's your call ... __eou__

Is there anything else I should send ? __eou__ No , that is all we need . If we have those things included , that is sufficient . __eou__ Do you know when they will start setting up interviews for the job ? __eou__ I'm not really sure about that .

I ’ m interested in all kinds of your products , but this time I would like to order some fireworks and mosquito coil incense . Please quote us C . I . F . Rangoon . __eou__ Please let us know the quantity required so that we can work out the premium and freight charges . __eou__ I ’ m going to place a trial order for 1,000 units of a dozen fireworks and 500 cartons of mosquito coil incense . __eou__ All right . Here are our F . O . B . price lists . All the prices are subject to our final confirmation . __eou__ Your price is reasonable but I wonder if you would give us a discount . You know for the products like yours we usually get 2 % or 3 % discount from European suppliers . __eou__ We usually offer on a net basis only . Many of our clients have been doing very well on this quoted price . __eou__ Discounts will more or less encourage us to make every effort to push sales of your products . __eou__ The quantity you ordered is much smaller than those of others . If you can manage to boost it a bit , we ’ ll consider giving you a better discount . __eou__ As far as a trial order is concerned , the quantity is by no means small . And generally speaking , we like to profit from a trial order . I hope you ’ ll be able to meet our requirements . __eou__ Well , as this is the first deal between us , we agree to give you an one-percent discount as a special encouragement . __eou__ 1 % ? That ’ s too low a rate . Could you see your way to increase it to 2 % ? . __eou__ I ’ m afraid we have really made a great concession , and could not go any further . __eou__ It seems this is the only proposal for me to accept . I ’ ll come again tomorrow to discuss it in detail . __eou__ All right . See you tomorrow . __eou__
So how did I do ? __eou__ Not too good , I'm sorry . __eou__ I lost ? __eou__ It was close.To be honest , you had the lowest price by three cents per hint , but they didn't like your delivery date.Acme promised them almost a full month sooner . __eou__ So the price was good ? __eou__ Yes , they loved the price , the delivery date was the problem . They just didn't want to cut the delivery date that close.If something went wrong and you didn't deliver , we might not be able to get stock in time for Christmas.If you could have been two or three weeks faster on delivery , they might have gone with you . __eou__ So I didn't miss by much then . __eou__ No.It was very close and they argued over the bid for a long time . Better luck next time . __eou__ I knew the delivery was slow but I figured the price would win it for me . __eou__ That's possible , Bill.But the price would have to have been a lot lower , like around fifty cents per unit . __eou__
Our current apartment is valued at RIB 700,000 . We can sell it and put that money towards buying the new apartment . __eou__ Yeah , but we still need RIB 500,000 . Maybe we can use some of our savings to pay part of it . __eou__ And we can take out a loan to pay the rest . __eou__ Great , so we can afford the new apartment after all ! __eou__ Uh huh ... but we're going to have to cut back on our shopping from now on . __eou__
Ok , I ’ Ve got an up-to-day map . Let ’ s check the route from here to the airport . __eou__ Where are we ? Oh , here we are . So we drive to the A120 and turn left . __eou__ No , we turn right . Remember that we are coming from this direction . __eou__ Oh yes ! Sorry ! Then we drive to the M11 motorway . __eou__ How far is that ? __eou__ It ’ s only seven miles . We turn left to join the motorway and drive south . __eou__ According to the map , we get off the M11 at the second junction and join the M25 . That ’ s the motorway that goes around the edge of London . __eou__ That ’ s another 15 miles , so that ’ s 22 miles total so far . __eou__ Then we drive west on the M25 . we must be careful to turn in the right direction ! __eou__ Then we drive on the M25 . it turns south . When we reach exit 15 , we turn left and go west along the M4 . __eou__ Then we take the first Heathrow Airport . What ’ s the total distance ? __eou__ The journey around the M25 is 33 miles and then 3 extra miles to get to the airport . So how many miles is that together ? __eou__ 22 miles to the M25 , 33 miles on the M25 , and 3 after that . That ’ s a total of 58 miles , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ It shouldn ’ t take us very long to cover that distance . Remember that we can go quite fast on the motor way . __eou__ We can only go fast on the motor ways if there isn ’ t much traffic . I think we should allow ourselves plenty of time to get there . Being early is much better than being late . __eou__
Hello , Alice . Would you like to go to the temple fair with me ? __eou__ Temple fair ? __eou__ Yes . The ancient custom of holding temple fairs is to offer sacrifices to the god of the earth , and they have developed into a festival filled with food , performances and games now . __eou__ Sounds interesting ! __eou__ Absolutely , I love temple fairs . Beijing has several temple fairs recently . They are different from each other to some extent , but also have a lot in common . __eou__ I just can't wait to see them . Which one do you choose today ? __eou__ What about Tianqiao Temple Fair ? A variety of opera performances , acrobatics shows , and food will dazzle you . __eou__ Great ! Do you know how to get there ? __eou__ Of course . __eou__ Couldn't be better . __eou__
You're right--Italian ! Ha ! Ha ! I was trying to trick you , but you didn't fall for it ! __eou__ I almost did !

Maybe if things slow down later I'll stop by your table . __eou__ I'm Robert , at your service . __eou__ Rita . Nice to meet you . __eou__
Kate , you never believe what's happened . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Masha and Hero are getting divorced . __eou__ You are kidding . What happened ? __eou__ Well , I don't really know , but I heard that they are having a separation for 2 months , and filed for divorce . __eou__ That's really surprising . I always thought they are well matched . What about the kids ? Who get custody ? __eou__ Masha , it seems quiet and makable , no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out . __eou__ That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about . Well , I still can't believe it , Masha and Hero , the perfect couple . When would they divorce be final ? __eou__ Early in the New Year I guess . __eou__
Nurse , I am sure to die soon . They just don't tell me the truth , I know . __eou__ But I don't think so . No one has ever said a word that you are to die , only yourself . That means you are not willing to die , right ? Actually , you are recovering and what you imagine as your worry is slowing down the treatment . Many cases worse than yours turned out to be hopeful and successful . You must be confident . Your condition is much better physically , but a little bi difficult mentally . The most important thing for you now is cooperation with us . __eou__ Is what you said really true ? __eou__ Of course . I am a nurse and a nurse tells the truth . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__

The software engineers are testing it just now . __eou__ Have all the operators been trained on it ? __eou__ Yes , most of them . We trained on a dummy system last month . A couple of people were away so we've organised two more training sessions on the live system for the whole team this week . __eou__
In foreign trade , language differences are very important . __eou__ Yes . If people can not communicate with each other easily , they can not understand each other's way of thinking . __eou__ Fortunately , there is a widely-spoken commercial language , namely English . __eou__ Many exporters speak French and German as well . __eou__ In South America , the most common language is Spanish and Portuguese . __eou__ Even if the language is accurate , a misunderstanding can not be avoided due to cultural differences . __eou__ Yes , the language is a part of culture . It reflects a nation's character . __eou__ Yes , it not only includes the nation's historical and cultural background , but also contains the nation's view of life way of life and way of thinking . __eou__ So in foreign trade , you must be very clear about language differences . __eou__
Your request for compensation makes me surprised . What happened ? __eou__ It is because of the quality . __eou__ Could you tell me the particulars ? __eou__ I told you that we want first-class goods . So the quality , specification and price are clarified in our contract . Do you remember those details ? __eou__ Yes , I do . __eou__ The re-examination results indicate that one-third of the goods are not up to standard . __eou__ Really ? We began to load the goods after we made sure they were qualified . __eou__ I told you the truth . According to the contract , if you fail to honor the contract , we are entitled to cancel it . __eou__
It was very kind of you to give me a tour of the place . It gave me a good idea of your product range . __eou__ It ’ s a pleasure to show our factory to our customers . What ’ s your general impression , may I ask ? __eou__ Very impressive , indeed , especially the speed of your NW Model . __eou__ That ’ s our latest development . A product with high performance . We put it on the market just two months ago . __eou__ The machine gives you an edge over your competitors , I guess . __eou__ Certainly . No one can match us as far as speed is concerned . __eou__ Could you give me some brochures for that machine ? And the price if possible . __eou__ Right . Here is our sales catalog and literature . __eou__ Thank you . I think we may be able to work together in the future . __eou__

I want to ask you for a favor . I want to rent an apartment here in Beijing , but as a foreigner , I don't know the normal practice . Can you give me some advice ? __eou__ First , why don't you tell me what you need , such as how big a room , where you want to live , whether you want to live downtown , and what you like to do . Then I can figure out which apartment is most suitable for you . __eou__ I am a student and want to live in Haitian , so that I can live close to my school . I like to play soccer and I like a quiet apartment so I can study . __eou__ I think that an apartment with two rooms and a kitchen would suit your needs . I can introduce you to a place for rent near your school . The apartment is on the 7th floor , so it is very quiet and suitable for studying . __eou__ That sounds great ! __eou__ You can also go to the school's sports field to play soccer , and if you're lucky you might make some Chinese friends there . It is right near the market and has comfortable facilities . __eou__ Thank you so much . That's very kind of you . __eou__
Where do these flower vases come from ? __eou__ They are made a town nearby . The flower vases are made of porcelain and covered with tiny bamboo sticks . __eou__ Are they breakable ? __eou__ No . They are not only ornamental , but also useful . __eou__ No wonder it's so expensive . __eou__
Hello ! nice to see you here at the finest centre again . What exercises are you going to do today ? __eou__ I'm going to do some jogging on the treadmill . Then I think I'll do some work with the dumbbless . __eou__ Good idea . I'd suggest you do some crunches too . Thery're great for getting in shape . Make sure you do them correctly . __eou__ Ok . I will . Could you help me with the treadmill ? I found it difficult to get the setting right last time . __eou__ Sure . Is today only you second visit ? __eou__ Yes , it is . I'll be coming here regularly . I think I need regular exercise to get in shape and then to stay in shape . __eou__ The treadmill is excellent for helping you to build up stamina . Each time you use it , increase this distance . don't worry about your speed at first . You can increase that later . __eou__ I was told that the first time I came heer . I was told not to put too much pressure on my body at first . I need to build up slowly . __eou__ That's right . You don't want to injure yourself by exercising too much or in the wrong way . Now , this is how you make the settings for the treadmill ... __eou__
I would like to have a new suit made . something in a dark blue wool . __eou__ Certainly , sir . Double or single breasted ? __eou__ I think I would like the pants pleated . I am not sure about the jacket though as I'm a little overweight . __eou__ I see , sir . For a gentleman of your size I would recommend a single-breasted jacket as it does tend to make one look a little slimmer . Just let me take your measurements , Let's see , neck 41cm , chest 110cm , wait 120cm and inside leg 70cm . You do have short legs , sir . __eou__ Yes , that is why I usually choose dark colours for my business suits . __eou__ Can you come back in three days for a fitting ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__ Good that way . I can have the suit ready for you two days after that fitting . __eou__
Good Morning , Mrs . Schmidt ! I see you're standing on your head again . __eou__ Hi , Kathy ! I'm just doing my morning yoga ! You're up awfully early today . __eou__ I have to finish preparing a paper for my Western Civilization class . __eou__ How has school been going ? You come home so late every night ! You're really a hard worker ... __eou__ Actually , I study a lot less here than I did in Taiwan ! My classes are great , though . Sociology is the perfect major for me . __eou__
Why is the long face ? __eou__ I'm getting sick of work man . I can't take the political bull in the company any more . __eou__ Did you just get your review or something ? __eou__ Yeah , but that's not why I am upset . I just found out another guy got a promotion . He doesn't know how to do anything . He sits there and kisses the managers butt all day long . __eou__ That sucks . __eou__ I'm just pissed that management can't see behind his smooth talking lies . __eou__ Look on the bright side . At least you have a job . __eou__ Yeah . I shouldn't stress about this anymore . It's not like I can do anything about it . __eou__ Exactly . Instead , we should have some drinks tonight . __eou__ How about a cold bottle of beer . __eou__ Now you're talking . __eou__
What are you doing , awake ? __eou__ I can't sleep ... __eou__ But it's almost midnight ! __eou__ Exactly . I'm too excited for Christmas morning . Also , I thought I heard Santa . __eou__ Really ? How do you know it was Santa ? __eou__ Well , I heard that naughty boys and girls get coal in their stockings , so I thought I'd be nice and make Santa cookies . I even left out some milk . I heard someone in the kitchen eating the cookies , so I came downstairs ! __eou__ Hmm ... well I know that Santa won't come down the chimney with you hiding behind the tree , spying on him ! __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Really ! Let's go back upstairs and get back to bed . That way , we can let Santa do his job . Then when you wake up , it will be Christmas already ! __eou__ O-K ... __eou__ Hey , honey ! Is that you ? Don't eat all the cookies — I want some , too ! __eou__
What did you think of the teambuiding session this morning ? Do you think it did much good ? __eou__ Well , a lot of the games were pretty silly . I don't know how much it helped us to be a better team , but i think everyone had a good time . __eou__ I think that's an important part of it all ... we've got to be able to see another side of our co-workers and boss ... We can see what they're like as real human beings , working together on some project , for fun . I really think it helped our team jell together better . __eou__ Yeah , I guess you're right . I think the trust game was my favorite . I think in order to have a strong team , we've all got to learn how to trust each other more . __eou__ The trust game was your favorite , huh ? My favorite part was the personality tests . I think to know more about what kind of personality type you are will tell you a lot about how you can fit into a team.Also , when you know the personality strengths of your colleagues , it helps you understand them better . __eou__
ORG ! It must be so late where you are . What time is it ? __eou__ just after 2 am . __eou__ what's wrong ? Can't sleep ? __eou__ nope , actually I was waiting for you . I have something big to tell you . __eou__ really ? What is it ? __eou__ I have an offer to work for a company in your city today ? __eou__ I can't believe it ! Is it real ? You're moving here ? __eou__ I haven't accepted the position yet and with the upcoming holiday I think it's the perfect chance to visit the city and take a good look at the company before deciding . If you have time I think we c __eou__ just give me the dates and I'll make sure I'm free . You know after all these chatting online , it will be great to meet you in real life . I look forward to seeing you soon ! __eou__ me too . But I think I am going to bed now . my head is getting heavy . Have a nice day there ! __eou__ thanks . This is so exciting . Sleep tight and sweet dreams ! __eou__ talk to you later . __eou__
I heard you received a prize for you book . __eou__ yes , I did . I won a prize for best local history book at the annual book awards . __eou__ congratulations ! You must be very proud of your achievement . __eou__ actually , I was happy just to get the book published . Winning the prize was an added bonus . __eou__ what was the prize ? __eou__ I won $ 200 to spend on any books of my choice . __eou__ that ’ s a great prize for a person who writes books ! Have you ever won a prize before ? __eou__ I shared a prize with some friends last week . We won a bottle of whisky at a pub quiz . __eou__ I won $ 10 in the lottery last month . Perhaps next time , I ’ ll be luckier and win the jackpot ! __eou__
Can I help you , sir ? __eou__ I'm here for the backpack you announced several minutes ago . __eou__ OK , take a seat please , sir . First of all , can you show me your ID please ? __eou__ Sure . Here you are . __eou__ OK , could you please tell me what your backpack looks like ? __eou__ Of course , it's a soft leather one , you know , not a sports one that looks childish . __eou__ Mmm ... does it zip closed ? __eou__ No , it's straps closed , and it has a buckle in the front . __eou__ OK , can you tell me the distinguishing features of this backpack ? __eou__ Oh , yeah , the brand name . __eou__ So what's it , sir ? __eou__ Oh , it's a Polo . It has the logo on the back and at the bottom in the left-hand corner . __eou__ OK , can you name the items in it ? __eou__ Well , all the gifts for my family , you know , two pairs of sneakers for my children and a bottle of perfume for my wife . __eou__ OK , sir , I'm sure it's your bag .

Thank you for your cooperation . You can have it now . __eou__ Thank you so much . You guys are really responsible . __eou__
Nice to meet you . __eou__ Nice to meet you , too . __eou__ You are a graduate , right ? __eou__ I recently graduated from college as an English major . __eou__ So you don't have much related work experience . __eou__ Admittedly , I don't . But I still beg you to give me an opportunity , and I'm willing to learn with my best effort . __eou__ Well , did you get any honors or rewards in college ? __eou__ I have got a Business English Certificate and a Certificate of TEM 8 . __eou__ What about your computer skills ? __eou__ I got professional training in this field , and I believe I can fit the position well . __eou__ And anything else ? __eou__ I have taken some courses in college , such as translation , business English , and so on . So I have a good mastery of both spoken and written English __eou__ I see . __eou__ Your approval would be my honor . __eou__
Hi , Francis , morning ! How are you doing today ? __eou__ I had a bad start of the day . I was stuck in a bad traffic jam on my way and I missed my morning meeting . __eou__ Indeed , I agree that is not a good start . How about the meeting ? You missed anything important ? __eou__ It is ok . My boss briefs me later on . __eou__ Was he unhappy with you not attending the meeting ? __eou__ Err , kind of . You know this traffic jam is really bad with so many new cars hitting the streets these days . __eou__
The boss had an informal discussion with me this morning , I feel really down . __eou__ What ’ s up ? __eou__ Well , actually I failed to meet a deadline last week and I forgot to answer an e-mail for a VIP customer yesterday . __eou__ Anything that distracts you from work ? __eou__ Yes , everything . I feel overwhelmed by the daily work . Sometimes , I just can ’ t focus on what I am doing . What is worse , though I make plans for a whole week , I always have to make changes later on because other things come up . I can ’ t manage my time well . I can ’ t handle work well . I am afraid I was screw up more things . __eou__ Look , Lucy . Things are not so bad as you said . This is our company ’ s busiest time in a year . You need to relax a little . Don ’ t push yourself too hard , ok ? __eou__ Well , I will try . __eou__
Can you believe her ? She is not even a hundred pounds and she is going off on how she wants to go on a diet . __eou__ Tell me about it . If I was as small as her , I wouldn't think about going on a diet . __eou__ Me too . But what are we going to do ? I have been on 4 different diets and I can't seem to lose weight . __eou__ That's because you don't exercise . If you were more active , you wouldn't have a dieting problem . __eou__ What do you know ? You are over weight too . __eou__ I'm not on a diet though . __eou__ I know . But I don't have someone to diet with . If we help each other and motivate each other , then I think we can lose some weight . __eou__ I like ice cream too much though . __eou__ C'mon . You'll feel better and look better and as a reward you can eat a little bit of ice cream here and there . __eou__ It does sound appealing . __eou__ It's a great idea . I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier . Going on a diet with a friend to back you up is a great way to succeed . __eou__ Okay . I'm in . Let's do it . __eou__ Great . I'll get our plan started right away . __eou__ Can we start tomorrow though ? __eou__
Won't you have some of this ? __eou__ Yes , thanks . __eou__ It's my grandmother's favorite recipe for barbecue . __eou__ It's very good . How do you make it ? __eou__ I use a special dressing and homemade catsup . __eou__ This salad looks so nice-just right for a hot day . __eou__ I'm glad you like it . __eou__ You Americans usually have nutritious food . __eou__ Oh , but Chinese food is so delicious . I wish I knew how to cook Chinese food . Do you follow recipes ? __eou__ We use different spices but few people use recipes . They learn to cook by experience . __eou__ I always use a recipe but my grandmother never did . She was a great cook . She would make clam chowder and cornbread every Sunday night . __eou__
Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes . I am a bit confused . My sociology class is supposed to read a chapter in a book called Sociology and the Modern Age . According to the syllabus , the book is in the library , but I haven't been able to find it . __eou__ Do you have your syllabus with you ? May I see it ? __eou__ Yes , uh ... I put it in the front of my sociology notebook . Oh , here it is . __eou__ Let me see . Oh yes . Your professor has placed this book on reserve . That means you cannot find it on the shelves in its usual place . You need to go to a special room called the reserve room . It's down the hall and to the right . __eou__ I'm sorry - I still don't understand . __eou__ You see , your professor wants every one in the class to read the chapter . If one student removes the book from the library , it is likely that none of the other students will have the opportunity to read it . So , your professor has insured that all students have the opportunity to read it by placing it on reserve . __eou__ So , will I be able to find this book ? __eou__ Yes , when a book is on reserve , a student can go to the reserve room and ask the reserve librarian for the book . The student can have the book for a few hours , and he or she MUST read it in the library during that time . That way , the book stays in the library , and all students have a chance to read it . __eou__ Okay . Thank you . I understand now . __eou__ Will there be anything else ? __eou__ No ! I am on my way to the reserve room . Thanks again ! __eou__
Hello , Bobby , It seems that I can't arrive at your home by 12 o'clock . __eou__ What happened ? We're all expecting you , Hans , Dick , Archie ... __eou__ I'm so sorry , I've been held up by the damn traffic jam for half an hour . I'd have arrived but for that . __eou__ I see . Where are you now , Li ? __eou__ Thirty meters ahead is the Waterloo Bridge . __eou__ It's not far away from home , It's - let me see – about 20 minutes'walk , Can you walk here ? __eou__ I've thought of that , but what can I do with my car ? If only I had taken a taxi ! __eou__ That's too bad , But don't worry.We ' ll put off dinner till one o'clock . __eou__ I'm so terribly sorry to keep you waiting . __eou__ It doesn't matter.Bye . __eou__ Bye . __eou__
There's someone coming . __eou__ It took them four minutes to get here . That was pretty fast . __eou__ Yes , it's fast . But four minutes is enough to do fifty thousand dollars damage . __eou__ I guess the fire wasn't in the tool shed after all.It looks like the back of the house was burning . __eou__ I wonder if anyone can call the Ridleys about this . Do you know them well ? __eou__ Not really . __eou__ Do you know where they're vacationing ? __eou__ I think they went to Mexico , but I'm not sure.It ' s a bad thing to return home to.They ' ll come home from their trip , and they'll see half their house burned . __eou__ Yes , but at least this way no one gets hurt.It ' s better to have a fire in your house when you're not home . Don't you think ? __eou__ Yes , I suppose . It's a dangerous thing if a fire starts when people are sleeping . __eou__
Did you smell something ? It smells so great . __eou__ It must come from the bakery on the corner.They are baking cookies . Their cookies are very popular in town . __eou__ How come I never knew that ? Do they have a new baker or something ? __eou__ I think so . The bakery invited a famous baker from the USA . He is good at making cookies . __eou__ Let's go and get some cookies . I am hungry now . __eou__ Look at the swiss roll over there , they look delicious , too , I am thinking about buying one . __eou__ You can taste some before you buy it . They have food tasting at the counter . __eou__ I am starting loving this bakery now . __eou__ It's one of my favorite bakeries . __eou__ You should have told me earlier . I am a cookie lover . __eou__
How do you want your hair cut ? __eou__ I want it the way Peckham wears it . __eou__ Who is Peckham ? __eou__ Are you kidding me ? Even the girls know Peckham . Whatever , I have a picture of him here . __eou__ You are a big fan of him ! He has strong legs . __eou__ Sure , he is a soccer star . __eou__ Hey , wake up . It's done . How do you like it ? __eou__ Oh , my God . It's disaster . It makes my head look like a soccer ball . __eou__ But it's the same hairstyle . __eou__ It looks like the hairstyle of Kahn who stands beside him in the picture . __eou__ Oh . I made a mistake . I thought the guy on the right was Peckham . __eou__ He plays outside right but it doesn't mean he has to stand on the right . __eou__ Sorry , but do not worry . I think I can fix it . Just cut a little more off the temple . __eou__ Do it , please . __eou__
Hey honey ! Where were you ? __eou__ I decided to take Kenny to the park and get some fresh air . __eou__ How was it ? Were there a lot of kids ? __eou__ It wasn't too crowded , but we had a great time ! We got on the see-saw together , then went on a couple of different slides and then I tried to go with him in the jungle gym , but I didn't fit . __eou__ Sounds like fun ! When we go he always just likes to play in the sandbox . __eou__ Yeah , but today he was really hyper . He even got on the monkey bars and then he went on to go on the swings for a half hour . I'm exhausted ! __eou__ You should go to the park more often since you don't go to the gym anymore ! __eou__
Ten dollars ? Maybe there are a lot of them ... __eou__ Seven dollars ! ! ! Incredible ! But I saw that the seller has kind of a bad rating . __eou__ Was it a delivery problem or a problem with the products ? __eou__ I read that someone called him a cheat and a liar ! And I noticed that he won't ship abroad . __eou__ Some people get nasty on those comments . Maybe you should write him and ask nicely . __eou__ OK . Wish me luck ! __eou__
There ’ s a big sale on clothes and sporting goods at Riverside Mall . __eou__ Sporting goods ? Is that bike Tim wanted on sale ? __eou__ Yeah , it ’ s 30 percent off the regular price . __eou__ Well , maybe we could get it now and hide it until his birthday . __eou__ Yeah , it ’ s a couple weeks away , and we don ’ t have anything yet . __eou__ Don ’ t buy him underwear again . He hates that . __eou__ I know , I know , but if I didn ’ t buy it for him , he ’ d never buy it . __eou__ See anything else we need there ? __eou__ Well , all shoes are 20 percent off . __eou__ Shoes ? You already have a closet full of shoes . __eou__ I know , but another pair can ’ t hurt . __eou__ Oh , all right . I need some new shirts , too . Let ’ s go after breakfast . __eou__
Sometimes I think television is too biased . None of them are completely objective . __eou__ That's unavoidable , but think , How would you keep up to date without television ? __eou__ Newspapers or the radio I guess . I just wish TV was more objective . __eou__ Look , you can still learn a lot from watching television , you just need to be smart when you're watching . Filter the information and decide if you believe what you are hearing or not . __eou__ The internet's a lot worse . __eou__ Really ? Why ? __eou__ There's no one moderating it . Anyone around the world can put information onto the net for anyone else to see . The information on the internet is mostly unsubstantiated and you can never know who has written it , or why . A lot of people get conned online . __eou__ Again , you need to think carefully . If you don't trust others online , have nothing to do with them . __eou__
Hey , Jeff , where's your stereo ? __eou__ I needed some money , so I hocked it last week . __eou__ You must have been really hurting for cash to have done that . __eou__ I had just enough money to make ends meet until payday . Then last Wednesday I received a phone bill to the tune of $ 195.00 . I hit the ceiling when I saw that . __eou__ It sounds like you weren't expecting that . __eou__ I'd forgotten that my brother had used my phone earlier this month to call his girlfriend . He forgot to mention that she happened to be in New York at the time 3000 miles away . __eou__ Well , if you need some money to tide you over until payday , I can loan you some . __eou__ Thanks , but tomorrow's payday I can make until then . Thanks any-way . __eou__
Anita , I ’ Ve been here only three days and you ’ re leaving already . __eou__ Just for a few weeks . I need this vacation . You ’ ll be all right . You know the project we ’ re working on , and you ’ re a good scientist . Don ’ t worry . I ’ ll be back as soon as I spend or gamble all my money . __eou__ Gambling ? Where ? __eou__ Las Vegas . I find gambling relaxing . I don ’ t take it seriously , the way some people do . Besides , I love the shows and the all-night atmosphere of the town . The casinos never close , you know . __eou__ If you gamble all night , you ’ ll run out of money in a few days . __eou__
You look bright-eyed and bushy-tailed . __eou__ Of course , just five minutes ago I got the phone call from Future Clothes Company and I was told to start my trial period in that company next Monday . __eou__ Congratulations ! Let's get together sometime . __eou__ Great idea . __eou__ Well , I am worried to death right now ! There is still no news from the company for me . __eou__ Let it be ! Time will tell . __eou__ Maybe they will send me e-mail to inform the result . Let me check my mail-box again . __eou__
Welcome to our company Mr white . My name is Yan Hua , the secretary of Mr Wang . __eou__ Nice to meet you ! __eou__ Would you like to have a cup of tea or coffee ? __eou__ Thank you . I'd like Chinese tea very much ! __eou__ Glad you like it . By the way , is this your first time to China , Mr . White ? __eou__ Yes , as a representative of IBM . I hope to conclude some business with you . __eou__ We also hope to expand our business with you . __eou__ This is our common desire . __eou__ I think you probably know China has adopted a flexible policy in her foreign trade . __eou__ Yes , I have read about it , but I would like to know more about it . __eou__ Right . Seeing is believing . __eou__ Sure . __eou__
One thing I love our boss for is that he always knows when to give you a pay raise without being asked for . __eou__ Really ? How can he be so sure about the timing ? __eou__ He just knows either by your excellent performance at work or by the annual review . __eou__ Well . This must save lots of employees from worrying about how to write a salary increase letter . You know how tough it is . Do all the employees receive the same pay increase annually ? __eou__ Actually not ! Our company pays for performance . __eou__ I like this system . It will encourage the best employees and motivate those who want to make a change at work . __eou__
Good afternoon . I'd like to speak with Tom Smith . __eou__ I'm afraid he's away from his desk at the moment . __eou__ Do you know when he will be back ? __eou__ He's away on a business trip . He won't be back until some time next week . __eou__ Is there some way I can get into contact with him ? __eou__ The best way to reach him is by cell phone . I'll give you his number . __eou__ Thanks . And could I have his e-mail , just in case I can't get him by phone ? __eou__ Sure . His cell phone is 09112223 33 . And his e-mail is lower case t , smith--that's one word , at , c , c , w , dot , com , dot , t , w . __eou__ Thank you so much . Does he read his e-mails daily ? __eou__ Yes . He usually replies immediately . __eou__ Great . Thanks again . You've been very helpful . __eou__ My pleasure . I hope you get a hold of him . __eou__
Sis , why did you ask me to come to this bargain market ? It's so crowded , and you can't find anything that you really want . __eou__ You just don't get it . Looking for bargains can be really interesting . __eou__ Are you serious ? How can that be ? __eou__ Bargaining is a game , or even a battle . You feel like a winner when you get a good price . __eou__ Come on . You know , you can never really win . The salesperson never loses . They make their living out of it . __eou__ That's true . But I just love it . Come here ! __eou__ Oh , this silk carpet is really beautiful . Look at the pattern , and how delicate it is ! __eou__ You do have great taste . That's the most expensive stuff here . __eou__ Really ? Oh , this one . I like the cloisonn vase . __eou__ Are you kidding me ? I bought a same one last week . It's surprising that there is something we both like . Well , what do you think of these ceramic cups ? __eou__ Come on . They look so cheap . Something else , please . __eou__ What about this picture ? I think Benjamin would like it . __eou__ Don't underestimate his taste . I don't think he'd like it . __eou__ Don't be so sure . He loves the vase I bought here last week . __eou__ Yeah . Well , anyway , it's up to you . But I can tell that you come here often . __eou__ Absolutely . That's why I can always get a good price . __eou__
Hi , Michael , how's it going ? __eou__ Well , things are all right . __eou__ I heard you got a new roommate . What's he like ? __eou__ Yeah , Bob moved in last week . He is a nice guy and so far everything is cool except this girlfriend . __eou__ Oh ? What's wrong with his girlfriend ? __eou__ She came over last weekend . She is a nice girl but there's something about her voice that really creeps me out . I tried to smile and be polite , but the whole time all I could think was " what's wrong with your voice ? " __eou__ Well , I guess it might take some time to get used to . __eou__ I doubt it . Last time was an oral train wreck . Listening to her talk is like chewing tin foil . __eou__ Oh come on , it's not that bad . __eou__ No , it's so much worse . And tonight they invited me out to dinner . I really have no idea how I'm going to pull it off . __eou__ Rough . Maybe you can do the most of the talking . __eou__ That's the plan . __eou__ Good luck . __eou__
Welcome ! Welcome to Little Italy . We're the most Italian family here ! __eou__ So I've heard . That's why I'm having such a great time . __eou__ If I hadn't married an Italian man , I probably wouldn't be pregnant so often . And maybe I could raise pigs instead of bambinos ! __eou__ Huh ? Um ... well , it's nice to see that some people still have big families . __eou__ It is nice , but it would be nicer if my macho husband would get off his tush and help me . Ha-ha ... Have this . It's from Italy ! __eou__
Jill , how do you like your new job ? __eou__ I like it . But how did you know about my new job ? I wanted to surprise you . __eou__ I just heard through the grapevine something about you landing a job with some travel agency down town . You can still fill me in on tile details . __eou__ Well , two weeks ago I got a tip about a possible job opening at Ace Travel Agency over on Franklin Avenue . __eou__ Sure , I think I know the place . __eou__ Well , anyway , I made a beeline over to their office , had an interview with the manager , and was told to start work the next day . __eou__ That ’ s really great , jill . So , what do you do there exactly ? __eou__ Right now I ’ m basically just a secretary , but if I ’ m given the chance , I want to become a travel agent there . __eou__ Don ’ t tell me your ’ re already bucking for a promotion . __eou__ No , of course not . I ’ Ve got a lot to learn yet . In the meantime , I just want to be a good secretary and not step on anyone ’ s toes . __eou__ Well I wish you luck . __eou__
Would you like to travel ? __eou__ Oh , yes . I often went on business trips in the past six years . __eou__ How many languages can you speak in addition to your mother tongue ? __eou__ I speak English and French in addition to my mother tongue , Chinese . __eou__ That's fine . What salary do you get at your present position ? __eou__ My present monthly salary is $ 1,500 . __eou__ We'll start you off with a base salary of $ 20,000 a year , with bonuses that can add up to $ 40,000 . A company car , and a company pension scheme . Is that acceptable to you ? __eou__ I think so . __eou__ Excellent . Well , thank you very much , Mr . B , and you'll be hearing from us in the next few days , either way . __eou__ Thank you . Mr . A , and I certainly hope the answer will be favorable . Goodbye . __eou__

Our offer remains open for 4 days . __eou__
Hey Stacy . What's going on ? __eou__ I'm pretty tired these days . __eou__ Why ? You're not working so don't you have a lot of time on your hands ? __eou__ I have so much house work to do . I have to take care of the kids , cook , clean , laundry , and the cycle never ends . __eou__ How about your husband . Does he help much ? __eou__ Not at all . He comes home and complains about his hard day at work . He expects me to do everything . He even wants me to feed him sometimes . Can you believe that ? __eou__ That sucks . __eou__ If he wasn't so lazy , I think I wouldn't have any complaints . He mows the lawn , but can you believe he tried to convince me to do it ? __eou__ That's crossing the line . __eou__ Oh well . I'll have to live with it . What else can I do ? __eou__
Oh , my God . I can't take it any more . __eou__ What's wrong , honey ? Take it easy . __eou__ I am tired of doing that boring work . I just repeat doing counting everyday . It's so terrible . __eou__ Me too . But I think we can do something else for a change . __eou__ You know I work with my professional knowledge not passion . Sometimes I don't know what the meaning of working is ? __eou__ But you did a good job . You always perform the best in our company . __eou__ Yes , that's in the past . Maybe I need to go to my psychologist for help . __eou__ Perhaps you've just tired and you need a vacation . __eou__ I was full of ambitions before . But now I have no aim for my career . __eou__ Maybe we should keep on studying to enrich our knowledge and make our life exciting . __eou__ That sounds interesting . But I don't know how to do that . __eou__ How about a training course ? __eou__ A training course ? That must be costly . __eou__ But it's worth it . Maybe it can get us into a good mood and also helps us learn something to use for the future . __eou__ OK , let's have a try . __eou__ OK . __eou__
Fred , can you tell me how I can open my QQ Zone ? __eou__ Click your right key of mouse and choose QQ Zone . __eou__ Well , I have to provide some of my information , right ? __eou__ Yep ! The nick name for your zone , address , gender and so on . Some of them are privacy , so you have the right to keep secret here . __eou__ All information is filled in and now I can design my zone . __eou__ You can choose one type to make it as your background , and then find a music player and put your favorite songs into it , so your visitors can enjoy the music after entering into your zone . __eou__ Now everything is OK . I can write my blog , right ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__ ( Half an hour , Janice begins shouting excitedly . ) What's the matter with you ? __eou__ Look ! David gives his following-comment on my first blog . He is my first visitor . __eou__
Hello miss . Can I see your ticket number ? __eou__ Sure , here you are . And here are my application forms as well . __eou__ Thank you miss ... Wang . I'm Bob Jones and I'll be handling your application . __eou__ Nice to meet you Mr . Jones . __eou__ The first step is to determine your eligibility for a U . S . visa . Let's see here ... you're applying for a special business visa . Why is that ? __eou__ Well , my first order of business will be attending a conference in Seattle , but after that I intend to spend two weeks visiting my friends . I assumed a business visa would be required . __eou__ I think a regular visitor's visa should suffice . With this visa , you can stay in the United States for up to 90 days . __eou__ So I can attend conferences and do business on that visa ? __eou__ Yes . You are free to do temporary business with this visa . If you were planning on setting up a new business in the U . S . you might need to apply for a long-term visa . __eou__ Oh , I see . I think 90 days is more than enough time . __eou__
... The rings please . May this ring be blessed so he who gives it and she who wears it may abide in peace , and continue in love until life ’ s end . __eou__ With this ring I thee wed . Wear it as a symbol of our love and commitment . __eou__ Honey , that ’ s my pinkie . The ring goes on the ring finger ! __eou__ This one ? __eou__ That ’ s my index finger ! __eou__ Oh , right . This one , right ? __eou__ Umm ... that ’ s the thumb , Nick . __eou__ Okay , Okay , I got it ! This is the ring finger ! __eou__ That ’ s my middle finger , Nick . This is my ring finger ! __eou__
Mr . Chandler will be our new partner , so his visit this time will be extremely important for our cooperation in future , because it may decide whether Mr . Chandler sign the trade contract with us or not . Do you have some idea ? __eou__ I suppose we can bring him to visit our company , as well as our display room . In this way , he can know more about our company and our potential power . In my opinion , visiting the factory will help him learn our manufacturing process very much . __eou__ En , you are right , and he will trust us and maybe the contract will be signed soon . But remember to keep some skills of our manufacturing secret . On one hand , show his our best side ; on the other hand , do not show too much to protect our own business secrets . __eou__ Well , I understand . __eou__ Please make a detailed schedule on the visit this afternoon . __eou__
But how did you know I was working for WebTracker ? __eou__ When I was in LA , I met the WebTracker sales rep . __eou__ He couldn't have told you . Only a few people at WebTracker know about me . __eou__ The sales rep had a green note pad just like yours . He said everybody at WebTracker used them . __eou__ I can't believe it . I can't believe I fell into your trap . __eou__ We both may be snakes , Dave , but I'm just better at it . Among the snakes , I'm the sneakiest . __eou__
This'd better be good . I'm about to fire you all and find another company . __eou__ We've brought you a little something from the place down the street , Kitty Cafe-Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee beans ! __eou__ Mmm , smells good . Sure better than my instant . But please don't tell me this is another coffee-themed pitch . I thought I told you ... __eou__ ... yes , but this one has an all-new buzz . __eou__
What would you say if I told you I was going to quit school ? __eou__ I ’ d say , think twice about it . Well , you are not going to quit school , are you ? __eou__ I don't know . I failed my exam . __eou__ What did you get ? __eou__ A B plus . __eou__ That's not bad . __eou__ But I should have aced it . I mean I finished the paper so quickly , thinking it's a piece of cake . But when I knew my result , I was like what ? That can't be true ! __eou__ Listen , John . I understand that you are such an excellent student and I know you must have lots of stress , but you really want to give up ? __eou__ No , I don't . I just don't know how to handle this . This is my first time , you know . __eou__ I know . Don't worry . Do you know what you should do ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ You need to blow off some steam . The world is not on your shoulder . __eou__ How ? __eou__ Forget about school and exams . Come over to my house and have fun . I have some really good DVDs . __eou__ Thanks . But I really don't feel like watching movies tonight . I have to get an early start in the morning . __eou__ Then go to bed and have a good sleep . __eou__ I guess that's what I need . Thanks . You're being a really good friend . __eou__ Of course I am . Well , pleasant dreams ! __eou__ Thanks , bye . __eou__

See you then . __eou__ But wait , wait , will there be food that is not meat ? You know . I'm a vegetarian __eou__ Hey ! I didn't know that ! When did you become a vegetarian ? __eou__ The other day , I decided that I needed to loose more weight so I am going to try to be a vegetarian . And you know what ? I don't miss the taste of meat . __eou__ Relly ? That's amazing . __eou__ Yes , it really is . After having vegetarian diet . I have much more energy , I need less sleep , I feel calmer . I can maintain an ideal body weight without worrying about how much I eat and I can think more clearly . __eou__ Are you kidding ? I really don't think that you think less clearly on non-vegetarian diet . __eou__ Yes , maybe . But I feel better since becoming a vegetarian . Maybe you could also have a try . __eou__ Maybe I'll also have a try some day , but I'm afraid that it would be difficult for me to refuse meat . __eou__ Maybe you would change your mind after having a vegetarian diet . __eou__ We'll see . Anyway , I'll prepare some vegetarian food for the barbecue . See you then ! __eou__
Oh , my god . How can you stand living in such a messy dorm ? __eou__ Our place is spotlessly clean , compared with others . __eou__ Have you even tried to clean it once since you moved in at the beginning of the semester ? __eou__ In fact , I just swept the floor three days ago . __eou__ I think we need to restart the dormitory sanitation inspection system . __eou__ I bet nobody will care about it . __eou__

Are you sure you're taking care of yourself ? __eou__ I'm fine , Mom . Remember Holly ? This is her roommate , Yi-jun .. __eou__
What a letdown . I wanted to experience some Mafia culture firsthand . __eou__ It's worth it just to go and eat what the mafia eat ! The five-dollar tiramisu is a culinary orgasm . __eou__ Such a thing exists ? __eou__ Fortunately , yes . You're blushing ! __eou__ Am I ? Um ... my face gets red when I walk too fast . __eou__ You're embarrassed , aren't you ? You gotta loosen up in Little Italy . The lady at the cafe will kiss you when you meet her ... __eou__
Michael Johnson doesn ’ t look graceful , but he sure is powerful . __eou__ If I were on as many steroids as he was , I think I ’ d be powerful , too . __eou__ What are you talking about ? ! He ’ s passed every drug test he ’ s taken ! __eou__ Those drug tests don ’ t mean anything ! He probably took some other drugs to mask the steroids . __eou__ Just because Ben Johnson was juiced up doesn ’ t mean all athletes are . __eou__ OK , OK . I ’ m feeling a little dehydrated . Let ’ s get something to drink . __eou__
Hi , Jack . Long time no see ! __eou__ Yeah . How's everything going ? __eou__ Not bad . At least I am still alive . __eou__ Just alive ? I guess you are some lucky guy .

Recently I've got a project to deal with and don't have much time to work out . __eou__ why ? You have a decent salary , lots of promotion opportunities and a regular life of going to the office at 9 o ' clock and coming back home at 5 in the evening . __eou__ it's not about pay raise or promotion . You know , I hate getting up early in the morning and coming back home late at night . __eou__ then SOHO is your ideal work style . __eou__ yeah , as long as I have a computer and internet access , I can start working . I recently enjoy working in my own place and at my own pace . __eou__ and you don't have to work under that much pressure and control . __eou__ absolutely . I can decide when and what to do all by myself . __eou__ sounds great . Are there many business opportunity ? __eou__ yeah , I can find enough online . __eou__ it's good to have business around .

do you like playing games ? __eou__ I like playing computer games , but I'm not really into board games . __eou__ how about individual games like the Rubik's cube or solitaire ? __eou__ the Rubik's cube is so difficult to solve that I think it should be banned ! __eou__ if I taught you how to do it , I'm sure you could solve it . __eou__ how did you figure out how to slove the Rubik's cube ? __eou__ I didn't really have to figure it out . I just followed the instructions ! __eou__ I had no idea there were a set of instructions . I thought everyone who could solve it were all geniuses ! __eou__ hints are really important when you're solving puzzles . If you give me some hints about playing that PS2 game , I ’ ll show you how to solve the Rubik's cube . __eou__ it's a deal . __eou__ do you remember , years ago , when everybody at the New Year's party had yo-yos ? __eou__ yeah .

I haven't tried yo-yo since that party ! __eou__ I could never figure out how to use my yo-yo . __eou__ if you don't start when you're young , it's hard to get the hang of it . __eou__ let's get started with this game then . __eou__ ok . __eou__
Good morning ! Marquette General Hospital . Tia speaking . May I help you ? __eou__ Hi , this is Emily Wang , I want to see a doctor today . __eou__ Your medical card No . , please ? __eou__ GRM 789051 __eou__ Thanks . Do you have an appointment , Ms .

Alan , I believe you have studied our catalogue and price list . Are you interested in some of our products ? __eou__ Yes , I'm thinking of buying some T-shirts , but I find your price is on the high side . __eou__ I'm very surprised to hear you say that . I think our price is very favorable . You can hardly get such an attractive price from other suppliers . __eou__ I'm not so sure of that . I think it's difficult for me to push sales at such a price . __eou__ What's your proposal then ? __eou__ I think to get the business done , you should at least reduce the price by 20 % . __eou__ We could take a cut on the price if your order is a large one , but a 20 % reduction is really more than we can do . What quantity are you going to order from us then ? __eou__ As a trial order , I'll take 5,000 dozen this time . __eou__ 5,000 dozen is by no means a large order . In that case , the best I can do is to give you a 5 % reduction . __eou__ That's really a big change from 20 % . I really can't accept that . __eou__ What's your counter-offer then ? __eou__ To conclude the deal , I'd say a reduction of at least 15 % would help . __eou__ 15 % is impossible . That'll leave us almost no profit . __eou__ If that's the case , I'll have to go somewhere else to meet my needs . __eou__ How about doing it this way ? You increase your quantity to 8,000 dozen and I'll give you a l0 % reduction . __eou__ 8000 would be too large a figure to be used for a trial . __eou__ Well , to encourage future business , I'm prepared to reduce the price by 10 % . We can't go any further . __eou__ Ok . Let's call it a deal . __eou__
What kind of work do you want to do when you finish university ? __eou__ I want to work in the banking industry . I ’ Ve always been interesting in working for an international invest bank .

Our course will end soon . __eou__ Yes . I ’ Ve sent letters to several banks . A few have invited me for interviews after we take our examinations . __eou__ Well done ! I haven ’ t sent off any job applications yet . __eou__ Which field would you like to work in ? have you decide yet ? __eou__ I ’ d like to work in marketing . I think I could have a good career in that field . __eou__ Perhaps you should apply to banks as well . They need people to market their service . As you said , the banking industry pays well . __eou__ That ’ s great idea . Do you have the email address of human resource managers at any banks ? __eou__
It says here that you graduated from Beijing Normal University with a major in English Language and Literature . __eou__ Right . Then you may think that I am not fit for this job according to my educational background . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ But I want to be a tour guide very much because I like traveling and meeting various kinds of people . So I took an evening course at the Tourism School of Beijing after graduation and I have gotten a qualification certificate . __eou__ So you must be an extravert ? __eou__ Yes , I always enjoy being with a group of people and chatting with them . __eou__ What do you think are the responsibilities of a tourist guide ? __eou__ A tourist guide must be responsible for arranging and coordinating tour activities , and offering service of transportation , accommodation , sightseeing , shopping and entertainment . __eou__ Don't you consider it a hard work ? __eou__ Hard but interesting , I think . __eou__ Have you any experience as a tourist guide ? __eou__ Yes , I usually guided foreign tourists around Beijing when I was in University . __eou__ Have you ever learned any other foreign languages other than English ? __eou__ Yes , I have learned a little French and Japanese as well . __eou__

I'm here about those documents . __eou__ Ah yes , the ones from Sapporo we were dealing with yesterday ? __eou__ That's right . I had a phone call asking me to come back in , about rejecting them ? __eou__ Well , we were contacted by your manager and he said ... __eou__ Yes , we talked about it and thought it was better and significantly quicker to ask the company to pay a Discrepancy Fee . __eou__ The customer got back to us this morning and they have agreed to pay a Discrepancy Fee of 100 US dollars . __eou__ That's wonderful news ! I'm glad we decided to rethink our actions ; it's all turned out for the best this way . Thank you for helping us to fix that little problem . __eou__
Mom , I've got something to tell you . __eou__ So , please ! __eou__ Aunt Jane buys a new bike for Tom . He is putting on grand airs . __eou__ I bought you a new one last year . Isn't it handsome ? __eou__ It is great . But Tom's bike is so much better than mine . __eou__ Frankly , he is more well-behaved than you . __eou__ Nothing of that sort ! __eou__ Why hasn't the bus come yet ? Every morning we have to wait for so long . __eou__ Mom , it's OK . I will buy a big car one day . It is faster than the bus . __eou__ Really ? I am looking forward to that . What about the traffic ? __eou__ Let me see.Yes . I will buy a plane for you . There is no traffic up there . __eou__

I don't like heat and humidity . __eou__ It's not that hot . It's cooler than yesterday . Let's go swimming ! __eou__ That's a thought . It's still early , and the beach isn't crowded at this time of the day . If we don't stay too long , we won't get sunburned . __eou__ Yeah , sounds like fun . I can wear my new pink bikini . __eou__ There won't be anyone there to appreciate how cute you are . __eou__ Who cares ! Well , the smart guys get there early . That's the kind of guy I want to meet . Let's go ! __eou__ If you are going to husband hunting in a bikini , then I want to wear one , too . __eou__ Ok , you could borrow one of mine . __eou__ Thanks , how about the green and black one ? __eou__ No problem . Here it is . __eou__
Would you like me to show you our new cleaning unit ? It's a clever design . __eou__ Yes , I'd like to see that . What does it clean exactly ? __eou__ It washes the solvent off all the metal parts - the blades , trays etc . - and then sends it back into the system . __eou__ What does the unit consist of ? __eou__ Well , it's basically two tanks – one for the dirty solvent and one for the clean solvent , a pump and a washing unit . Oh , and there ’ s a cooling system and a filter . It's all controlled by a PLC system – that stands for Process Logic Control . __eou__
Our factory locates at a village in the east of the city . The area of it is 3,600 square meters . __eou__ We'd like to visit the factory . Can you show me the way ? __eou__ That's OK ! We'll take you to have a tour . Please follow me . __eou__ How many shifts are there in your factory ? __eou__ There are two shifts now in total . __eou__ What about your company's QC management ? __eou__ We established the strict QC standards and we have followed it for about five years with good results . __eou__ Where are the workers from ? From the villages nearby ? __eou__ Most of them live in the city . We provide free commuter buses for the workers . Besides , we built the dormitory building for the workers on night shift . __eou__ It sounds nice . We can't wait to visiting the factory . __eou__
Ahahah ! What is that thing on your couch ! It just moved ! __eou__ Did you think it wasn't real ? That's my pet lizard . __eou__ You have a pet lizard ? Somehow I never would have imagined that . __eou__ His name is Grunt . Come closer and I'll properly introduce you . __eou__ Does it bite or scratch ? __eou__ No , he's perfectly harmless . And he's not afraid of strangers either . Here , hold him . __eou__ Wow . He's heavy ! And his skin feels really cool . __eou__ Stick around and you'll get to know him better . He has a very unusual personality . __eou__
Hi , there . Look at these . I have collected some ads here . There is a special promotion for Mother's Day this weekend . __eou__ Oh , yes . Mother's Day is coming . Do you plan to buy anything ? __eou__ Of course . I want to buy some night cream for my mom , and some masques for myself . __eou__ Hmm . In Carrefour , Clinique will be promoting their visible skin renewed cream . __eou__ How much is it ? __eou__ 180 yuan , and you can get a free 8 piece gift package . __eou__ What's included in the gift package ? __eou__ Some black mascara , moisturizing orion , eye cream crystal lipstick , a two color eye shadow pack , styling hairspray , and a cosmetics bag . __eou__ Sounds not bad . __eou__
After you __eou__ Thank you ! __eou__ What's the weather like in your country ? I suppose it must be warmer than here . __eou__ Oh , yes . We have rather mild winters . It always has much sunshine in winter . But it was very foggy when I left two days ago . I knew it would be colder here , but I thought there would be a lot of snow . __eou__ We don't have much snow in winter in Beijing . In fact , we haven't had any so far this winter . The winter is rather long , but the cold is generally not severe . The temperature seldom gets as low as ten below zero Centigrade . __eou__ What is the temperature today , do you know ? __eou__ About freezing point , I think.But the morning's forecast said that we are going to have a very cold spell in the next few days - and the temperature will probably drop to 10 or 15 degrees below zero . __eou__ Oh , I'm very lucky that my wife let me take a heavy overcoat . __eou__ It is considerate of your wife . __eou__ Yes , she is . By the way , what is the best season in Beijing ? __eou__ Fall is the best season in Beijing . It's neither hot nor cold . The sky is clear and blue . There's hardly any wind , only a slight breeze which is hardly noticeable . And we have plenty of sunshine too . __eou__ Really ? Then I will come to Beijing in the fall next time . __eou__ Good , you are welcome . __eou__
Here is the final draft of our contract . I'm glad that we have reached an agreement on almost every term in our trade . __eou__ Yes , it seems to me we have come quite a long way . However , let me take a close look at the final draft . __eou__ Do you have some points to bring up ? __eou__ Well , everything we've discussed seems to be here . __eou__ Yes , including a description of the shirts you want to purchase this time , the total amount of your order , the price for each piece , mode of payment , packaging , shipping time , insurance and compensation , claim and arbitration , and rights and duties for both sides .

What about the quality standard ? __eou__ It is said that the sample 25 is the standard for others . It's complete . So would you like to sign the contract right now ? __eou__
Loans Department , how can I help you ? __eou__ Hello . Could you give me some details about your Personal Pledge Loans , please ? __eou__ Certainly , Sir . I'd be happy to . The Personal Pledge Loan is a loan secured by undue certificates , Time Deposits , for example , or Visible Treasury Bonds . __eou__ So , as long as I have one of those , I can apply for a Personal Pledge Loan ? __eou__ That's correct , Sir . The bank will issue receipt to you and also take care of all the pledged securities . __eou__ Mmmm ... how about the period of repayment ? __eou__ The maximum maturity period is a year , but it also cannot exceed the maturity on the certificates used as collateral . __eou__ And the maximum loan amount ? __eou__ The initial amount is just 2,000 RIB , but we can go up to 100,000 RIB . But remember , it cannot exceed the amount on the certificates you are using as collateral . __eou__ OK . I'll have a look at what I've got exactly in certificates and get back to you . Thanks for your help . Bye . __eou__ My pleasure , Sir . Bye . __eou__
you're rather energetic today . What's going on ? __eou__ nothing really . I think I've had a few too many coffees . __eou__ free coffee is one of the perks at this place , isn't it ? __eou__ it's the only perk of this job ! How's your day going ? __eou__ not that well . I've got that Monday morning feeling today . __eou__ why is that ? __eou__ my boss has been breathing down my neck all day . I can't wait for the weekend ! __eou__ your boss is a real salve-driver , isn't he ? __eou__ you can say that again ! He won't even let us check our personal email at work ! __eou__ that's not just your boss . No one is allowed to send personal emails from the office . __eou__ really ? I didn't know that it was against company policy . __eou__ maybe your boss isn't so horrible after all ! __eou__ no , he is . Some bosses will bend the rules a bit sometimes , but not my boss . He always follows the rules to a T . __eou__ try not to let it bother you too much . __eou__ thanks . I better get back to my work before my boss yells at me again ! __eou__ ok , I'll see you in a bit . __eou__ alright . See you later ! __eou__
Dora , are you interested in going to the museum with me tomorrow ? I read the newspaper this morning . I know there is an art exhibition in Taipei Modern Art Museum . __eou__ Sure . I am free tomorrow . It sounds interesting to me . Can we buy the ticket online ? __eou__ I don't think so . I think we had better go there earlier , or we may have to spend a lot of time waiting . __eou__ I guess that is the thing we can do with we really want to visit the museum . __eou__ Look at the ticket booth in the center . There seems to be not as many people as we thought it would be . __eou__ Yeah . We are lucky . Let's go buy the tickets first . We can have breakfast later . I am so hungry . __eou__ Good idea . __eou__ ( After the breakfast ) Which floor is the art exhibition we are going to ? __eou__ I have no idea . Let me take a closer look at my museum map __eou__ Sure , take your time . We have a whole day . __eou__ It's on the 2nd floor . We are going to see some beautiful paintings about the history of ancient Greece . __eou__ Look at the museum guide.It says there are also some sculptures and potteries in this area . Let's rent an audio guide . __eou__
who are you writing a letter to ? __eou__ I'm just responding to Sue's letter . Do you want to help ? __eou__ OK . I guess I could add something . Tell them that I send my love . __eou__ that's kind of boring . Don't you want to tell them anything else ? __eou__ well , maybe you could tell them about my promotion . __eou__ you've been promoted ? when did that happen ? __eou__ just today . I guess I forgot to mention it . __eou__ congratulations ! That's really exciting ! Let's get out a bottle of wine to celebrate ! __eou__ shouldn't we finish writing this letter first ? __eou__ ah . That can wait . Your promotion is the best news I've heard in a long time ! __eou__ it is good news , but it looked like you were almost finished . We might as well just sign off . __eou__ ok , you're right . I'll just tell them how round I am of you for getting a promotion and then I'll thank Sue for her kind letter . __eou__ I guess you can write that I'm looking forward to seeing them in June . __eou__ that's thoughtful of you . __eou__ and also thank them from the bottom of my heart for the Christmas package they sent us . __eou__ that's right ! I almost forgot about that . __eou__ what would you do without me ? __eou__ we do balance each other out well . I guess we were really made for each other ! __eou__
What are your career goals , Miss Li ? __eou__ Let me see , I would like to work my way up to a senior management position with a company such as yours . __eou__ Great ! It sounds like you might be a good fit . As you know , we ’ re one of the largest brokerage houses in the world . Our daily work is quite hectic , and we , re looking for an assistant who can keep us organized ... help keep the engines running smoothly , so to speak . Our hours are long , but the overtime pay is good ... sort of makes up for the long hours . __eou__ What would a typical day be like for me here ? __eou__ Well , that ’ s the problem . We never seem to have ' typical ' days , but you'd spend about 30 % of your time on the computer . There would also be a lot of telephone time , setting up appointment , and taking care of a lot of support work . __eou__ Oh , yes , I do . My present job is similar in that respect , and I think I ’ m doing a good job . __eou__
This facility is great , don't you think ? __eou__ Yes , it is better than last year . They have done a very good job this time . __eou__ I'm glad our booth is on the first floor . More people can see our display . __eou__ If someone wants to find us , they can look at this floor plan.It shows where all the companies have their booths . __eou__ Let me see that . I didn't get one when I came in . __eou__ Really ? They didn't give you one with your ticket ? __eou__ No . __eou__ That's strange . __eou__ Where do you go for lunch around here ? __eou__ Are you hungry ? __eou__ Not too bad . But I will be soon . __eou__ I went across the street . There is a good Chinese restaurant next to the hotel . __eou__ I can't see Cortex on this floor plan . Don't they have a booth here ? __eou__ They must . Let me look at that.Here it is . Cortex . It's on the second floor , next to the Roll booth . __eou__ Oh , that will be uncomfortable for them . __eou__ For whom ? Cortex ? __eou__ Yes . Cortex just stole Darren McDowell from Rolly.And probably Darren will be here.So he will have to spend the whole show standing next to his old Cortex coworkers . __eou__ I've never met Darren.But you're right . That would probably be uncomfortable . __eou__ When you reserve a booth , you should check who your neighbors will be.Don ' t you think ? __eou__ Yes , maybe . If you're Darren McDowell , you should probably check . __eou__ Yes . Well , I think I'll go get lunch . Will you join me ? __eou__ No , I'll stay here at the booth . I ate earlier . Are you going to the Chinese restaurant ? __eou__ Maybe . I will look around . __eou__
David , I am going for an interview tomorrow . It's an American company . Can you give me an idea of what the interviewer will ask ? __eou__ Well . They may ask you to tell them more about your educational background and your working background . __eou__ But they can see my resume . It's all in there . __eou__ I know , but sometimes interviewers just want to hear you say it . Then you may be asked for your viewpoint on why you feel you are qualified for the job , give them all your qualifications and how you think they will fit the position you are applying for . Questions like what sort of experience do you have and what are your goals ? are closely related to this . __eou__ Ok . What else ? __eou__ They may want to know how the company will benefit and why they should hire you ? __eou__ I see . What about the salary ? __eou__ Hm , they may ask you what kind of salary you have in mind , or simply tell you what the company is offering . I think the latter is more likely for a starting position , especially if you have little experience . And if they are seriously considering hiring you , they will probably want to know when you would be available to start work . And basically , that's about it . __eou__ Ok , thanks , David . You ’ Ve helped me a lot . __eou__ Anytime . Let me know how it works out . __eou__
Hello . This is Hamilton ’ s Heating and cooling service . Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes . My home freezer is not working properly . __eou__ What ’ s the problem ? __eou__ It keeps running all the time , never stopping . And it makes a strange sound . All the ice cream inside it melted . __eou__ Maybe the compressor is going bad . __eou__ Can you send the technician to check it out ? __eou__ Sure . But there is a minimum charge of $ 60 for a service visit . If your freezer needs parts , there will be an additional charge . __eou__ Okay . I ’ ll pay the charges . __eou__ All right . let me check our technician ’ s schedules . I ’ ll call you back and let you know what time we can send a service technician to your house . What is your phone number ? __eou__ My number is 627-555-1234 . __eou__ Okay . I ’ ll call you right back . __eou__ Thank you . Good bye . __eou__ Bye . __eou__
What's your favorite season ? __eou__ I like the freedom of summer with no school . __eou__ Yeah , and all those fun summer sports and activities . __eou__ And I like the festivities of winter with Thanksgiving , Christmas and New Year . __eou__ Oh , me too ! All the family getting together ... __eou__ And I really like the smells and colors of spring . __eou__ I like the feeling then that school is almost over ! __eou__ But I must say , if it were only for the weather , I like autumn most ! __eou__
How were things in the Tokyo branch when you were there ? __eou__ Good ! They have expanded and are doing better than they were last quarter . It's nice to see some improvement for a change . __eou__ Do you see the trend continuing over the next few months ? __eou__ Yes , especially with so many of our executives going back and forth from here to Japan . The only problem is , they may have trouble when they go to open up business here . __eou__ Why would you say that ? __eou__ They aren't too familiar with doing business outside of Japan . There are a lot of cultural differences to account for . __eou__ I'll say ! Sometimes they just do things really differently . But one thing I can say , they are really hospitable . __eou__ Have you ever been to Japan ? __eou__ Sure ! I just got back yesterday . I'm still suffering from jet lag . __eou__
Good coming ! Welcome to J P Interior Design . __eou__ Hi , I saw the sign outside says that you do all kinds of interior design . __eou__ Yes , we do . Do you have any specific needs ? __eou__ Well , I am thinking about redesigning my kitchen . __eou__ Do you prefer some specific style ? __eou__ Yes , I prefer a more contemporary design . __eou__ What kind of color tones do you like ? __eou__ Blue , green or earth tone colors . I do not like the colors that are too bright . __eou__ I see .

Where are the other guys ? __eou__ It's a bit disappointing that they are all out for a movie . __eou__ Bad timing . I want to see them so much . How are they ? __eou__ Not bad . I heard you are going to graduate this coming summer , right ? __eou__ Yes , that's why I'm here . I'm thinking about buying a second-hand apartment . __eou__ Did you go to a real estate agent ? __eou__ No , that will be too expensive . __eou__ That's true . By the way , what kind of apartment are you looking for ? __eou__ My first job's salary will be a bit low . So the cheaper the better . Just one I can afford . __eou__ Sure . I'll try my best to find a satisfying one for you . __eou__ I'll appreciate it so much . __eou__
You look like being on cloud nine . __eou__ I am . __eou__ What has made you so happy ? __eou__ I think I'm in love . __eou__ Are you ? Who's the lucky girl ? __eou__ Her name is Jenny . __eou__ How did you meet her ? __eou__ We are in the same math class . Our teacher sat us next to each other . __eou__ What do you like best about her ? __eou__ She's very funny . She makes me laugh all the time . __eou__ I guess it was fate working to bring you together . __eou__ Whatever brought us together , I'm happy . __eou__
Morning . __eou__ Hi there Mr . Anderson ! How are you on this fine morning ? __eou__ Fine , thank you . __eou__ It sure is cold this morning , isn ’ t it ? I barely even get out of bed ! __eou__ Yeah . It ’ s pretty cold , alright . __eou__ Did you catch the news this morning ? I heard that there was a fire on Byron Street . __eou__ No , I didn ’ t hear about that . __eou__ Did you happen to watch the football game last night ? The Patriots scored in the last minute ! __eou__ No , I don ’ t like football . __eou__ Oh . . . By the way , I saw you with your daughter at the office Christmas party . She is really beautiful ! __eou__ She ’ s my wife ! Oh , here ’ s my floor ! Nice talking to you . Goodbye . __eou__ Sir this is the 56th floor ! We are on the 70th ! __eou__ That ’ s okay , I ’ ll take the stairs ! __eou__
Well , Mike , nowadays there's much talk about nanometer . But what on earth is it ? __eou__ Nanometer is a length scale . It's one billionth of a meter , roughly ten times the size of an individual atom . __eou__ Hmm ... it's hard to figure out the exact size , I'm afraid . __eou__ Well , let's make it this way . For comparison , 10 NM is 1000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair . There are as many nanometers in an inch as there are inches in 400 miles . __eou__ I see.Thank you . __eou__
Hey , Frank . I heard you got a new job . __eou__ Yeah , Judy . I will be working for the Post Office . It ’ s not a bad job . __eou__ Is it true that you have a heavy work schedule ? __eou__ That ’ s right . I report to work at 5am everyday , and I only get 45 minutes for lunch . __eou__ So , why did you apply for such a demanding job ? __eou__ Well , the government offers its employees excellent health insurance benefits . __eou__ Oh , I see . And can your family utilize 5 the health insurance , too ? __eou__ Yeah , that ’ s the best part . All of my children can get free medical care . __eou__ That ’ s a great employment benefit ! __eou__ Now you know why I wanted to work for the Post Office ! __eou__
hi , Mary ! What do you like to do in your spare time ? __eou__ well , I spend a lot of time watching movies . __eou__ what a confidence ! I always watch a lot of movies , too . __eou__ oh really , Frank ? What kind of movies do you like ? __eou__ actually , I watch whichever movie there is , be it a comedy , a sci-fi or a suspense movie . How about you ? __eou__ art films are my favorite , but thrillers are cool , too . __eou__ really impressive . These two genres are totally different . __eou__ sure . I enjoy both of them very much . __eou__ how often do you go to the cinema ? __eou__ once in a while , I suppose , I usually rent movies at Movie Salon . __eou__ movie salon ? where is that ? __eou__ it's a movie rental store in my neighborhood . I've got a membership there . __eou__ is it good ? __eou__ yes , you can find almost all new releases there . __eou__ really ? Maybe I shall also sign up for its membership . __eou__ why not ? __eou__
What characteristics should an interpreter own ? __eou__ I think he should be an expert of everything . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ Because English is nothing but a tool which is used when people may negotiate in international conferences , probe into physics , release some information in a press conferrence , and do anything we can do with language . Therefore , an interpreter has to know some expertise in the field he / she serves as an interpreter . Otherwise he / she can not carry out his / her work smoothly . __eou__
Mr . White , I would like to give you notice that I will be leaving the company . It will be effective at the beginning of the next month . __eou__ Jessica , I am very sorry to hear that . Why are you leaving ? __eou__ I've been offered another job with higher salary . And it also gives me the opportunity of promotion . __eou__ Oh . If you had talked to me first , we would have given you a raise . __eou__ You are really a good employer , Mr . White and I am very lucky to have such a good boss like you . But this new job is more in my field of interest training . It's something I have always wanted . __eou__ Ok , good luck , Jessica . By the way , if you ever need a letter of recommendation , I would be happy to write one for you . __eou__
Hi , Customer Service Desk . What can I do for you today , sir ? __eou__ Good morning . I bought this vacuum here a few months ago . It doesn ’ t work now . Can I return it or get it fixed ? __eou__ Do you have your receipt with you ? __eou__ Yes , I do . __eou__ When did you buy it from our store ? __eou__ Four months ago . __eou__ I ’ m sorry . You can ’ t return it because too much time has passed since you purchased it . In order to receive a refund , you must return merchandise to the store within 90 days of purchase . __eou__ But the direction book says I will get one-year warranty . __eou__ Yes , I know . After 90 days , you need to call the company that manufactured the vacuum to fix it because it ’ s still under their warranty . Their phone number should be in the direction book that came with your vacuum . __eou__ Okay . I understand . I ’ ll call the Customer Service Office of the manufacturer . Thank you . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . __eou__
Hey , Mary . We're back . Have you eaten yet ? __eou__ I had some bread for breakfast . __eou__ Let's go out for brunch . __eou__ Brunch ? __eou__ It is a meal that combines breakfast and lunch . On Sundays , many Americans sleep late and go out for brunch . Those who go to church without having breakfast have brunch also . __eou__ Actually , many Taiwanese wake up late on Sunday mornings , too . It may be a good idea for them to eat brunch instead of eating breakfast and lunch . __eou__
But the auction is a blast ! And I haven't even told you the best part yet ! __eou__ I don't care what the best part is . Whatever you say won't change my mind .

Sorry , I've gotta go ! I'm going to switch over to eBay and see if my bid is still the highest . __eou__
Hello , Tom . I'm really glad to meet you here . __eou__ I'm glad too . Steven , I want to tell you that I'm going to divorce my wife . __eou__ I'm so surprised , B . Why did you decide to end your marriage suddenly ? __eou__ We don't get along well with each other and fight a lot . __eou__ I didn't know that . I thought that you were happy together . __eou__ That isn't true . Actually , we have been separated for six months . __eou__ I can't believe it . But if you both determine to divorce , I hope you will have an amicable split . __eou__ Thank you , Steven . I accept your advice . __eou__ Hello , Tom . I'm really glad to meet you here . __eou__ I'm glad too . Steven , I want to tell you that I'm going to divorce my wife . __eou__ I'm so surprised , B . Why did you decide to end your marriage suddenly ? __eou__ We don't get along well with each other and fight a lot . __eou__ I didn't know that . I thought that you were happy together . __eou__ That isn't true . Actually , we have been separated for six months . __eou__ I can't believe it . But if you both determine to divorce , I hope you will have an amicable split . __eou__ Thank you , Steven . I accept your advice . __eou__
Herman , why are you so excited ? __eou__ I have met a beautiful girl . __eou__ Have you fallen in love ? __eou__ Yes . At first sight . __eou__ Can you describe the situation at that time ? __eou__ At that time her back was ramrod straight as she sailed by , her tone is best , neither over-passionate , nor too cold . __eou__ What's her outlook ? __eou__ She was pretty , her hair was the color of rich dark chocolate , waving gently to her shoulders . Her complexion was clear and golden . __eou__
Welcome ! Sophia told us you were coming ! __eou__ Um ... It's wonderful to be here . Uh ... this place looks really cozy . __eou__ Thank you ! Your cheeks are as red as a tomato ! Are you shy ? __eou__ Maybe ... __eou__ Some of my grappa will cure your shyness . __eou__ Is that a kind of alcohol ? __eou__ It's a clear spirit we drink any time of the day . You will love it ! __eou__ Great . My face will turn even redder ! __eou__
Could you give some information on your European tours ? __eou__ Our pleasure . We have several package tours you may choose , from ten days to three weeks in Europe . __eou__ I would be interested in a ten-day trip around Christmas time . __eou__ I have one ten-day tour that is still available . It will depart from New York on December 24th . __eou__ What is the cost ? __eou__ The price for one person for a ten-day tour is only 1,099 US dollars , which includes round trip airfare . __eou__ That sounds reasonable . Let me think it over . And I'll call your back to make reservation . __eou__ Ok , but don't delay too long , or that trip will be all booked . __eou__
What price do you suggest for 300,000 sets of Article No . 2323 with London as the destination port ? __eou__ Let me see . It's £ 800 per set CIF London . __eou__ What commission terms can you offer ? __eou__ Usually the commission is three percent of the net invoice amount after deduction of discounts . __eou__ Couldn't you raise the commission to five percent ? __eou__ Considering our good relationship and our future business , we give you four percent . That's the best we can do . We can't go any further . What would you say to it ? __eou__ Then I'll accept it with thanks . __eou__
OK , so this is the main factory area . We're now walking past the printing machine . It's printing in four colours at the moment . __eou__ What's going on over there ? __eou__ They're setting up the machine for a new run . __eou__ How long does that usually take ? __eou__ About twenty minutes . __eou__ What's happening at the far end ? __eou__ That's the packing line . The goods are being wrapped and loaded onto pallets ready for transportation . __eou__
What's the price ? I hope you'll quote us favorably . __eou__ It's 800 US dollars per kilo CIF five percent Hamburg . __eou__ Frankly speaking , the price you offer is too high . We can't accept it . __eou__ Why ? This is a fair market price . __eou__ It certainly is . __eou__ Then what leads you to think that we have to reduce our price ? Please tell me candidly . __eou__ I look at it this way , suppliers should be able to reduce their CIF price , even lower than their home price . __eou__ We give you quotations on the same basis as we quote in the domestic market . __eou__ That's the point . Your overhead is in your domestic price , but it can't be carried in the CIF price . __eou__ But even with the overhead out , the export overhead must be put in . Finally , it comes to the same thing . Anyway , this is a quality item and should be sold on its value . __eou__ I wish you could make a reconsideration . If you don't reduce your price , we won't purchase from you any more because there's plenty of other business offering here . __eou__
Have you received any degrees ? __eou__ Yes . In 1996 I received my Bachelor of Science degree from Hebes University , and in 2001 I received my MBA degree from Peking University . __eou__ How about your academic records at college ? __eou__ In fact my records were excellent . My overall GPA was 9 on a 10 scale , which was the highest in my class . __eou__ That's very impressive . Which course did you like best ? __eou__ English . It was both interesting and useful , so I showed a great interest in it . __eou__ Can you tell me why you changed your major when you were a graduate student ? __eou__ Because I am very interested in administration and I did take some courses in it . I also performed well in the subjects . Hence I believe that I can do a good job in this position . __eou__ Did you get any honors and awards at college ? __eou__ Yes . I was awarded a scholarship from the university every year . In 1995 I participated in the National Contest of Maths Models and I won the prize . __eou__
Good afternoon , welcome to IBA . How can I be of service ? __eou__ I'd like to talk to somebody about the Group Account Deposit Service . __eou__ This refers to the deposit business offered to the level 1 account of group companies . __eou__ What is it used for ? I mean , why bother to get this special account ? __eou__ Group companies can use this to make their arrangement of funds flexible , when dealing with their subsidiaries . __eou__ I see , so this can really cut down on time and centralise management . Interesting ... __eou__
Did everyone fill out their entry permits ? __eou__ Yes . The videographer has already started filming my parents trying to speak English with the flight attendants . __eou__ Speaking of flight attendants , they keep smiling at me . I wonder why ... __eou__ It'll be the year 2000 ! The flight attendants are coming over here . They're carrying bottles of champagne ! __eou__ That's because it's time . __eou__ Time for what ? __eou__ It's time to make our wedding wish come true ... __eou__ You mean get married now ? On the plane ? __eou__ Why not ? I've got the rings ready . __eou__ I don't know what to say , Jack ! __eou__ Hopefully , you'll say " yes " ... __eou__
Hey Bobby . What's going on ? __eou__ Just taking a smoke break . __eou__ I forgot my cigarette today . Do you have another one ? __eou__ Sure . Here you go . __eou__ Thanks . __eou__ I didn't know you smoked . __eou__ Really ? I've been smoking for over a year now . __eou__ Oh . You're new to smoking still . I've been smoking for 7 years . __eou__ You ever tried to quit ? __eou__ Many times . I'm really addicted . It's harder to stop than you think . __eou__ Yeah . I tried to quit last month , and I thought it was going to be easy , but it turns out that I'm still smoking . __eou__ I highly recommend you quit soon . The longer you smoke , the harder it becomes to quit . __eou__ I think you're right . Aright . Gotta go to class . Thanks for the cigarette . I'll talk to you later . __eou__ No problem . I'll talk to you later . __eou__
Do you have a bf ? __eou__ Yes , I had a bf before . __eou__ Why you say bf before ? __eou__ We parted from each other last month . __eou__ Have you got a new one ? __eou__ Mmmm , no . How about you ? __eou__ I am single , I have no real of , only an E-gf , that is you . __eou__ Haha , so you are my E-bf . __eou__ I like you . Do you agree to be my of ? __eou__ Mmmm . .. OK , let's try to be . __eou__ Wow ! Blablablabla . . . __eou__ Hey ! What is it ? __eou__ I am flying like a bird . __eou__ LL __eou__ I am so happy . I want to drink a cup of champagne . __eou__ I have no champagne right now . How about this ? __eou__ It's OK , so I send you this . __eou__ Is it made of chocolate ? __eou__ It's my heart ; it's made of what you like . __eou__ Oh , I will have a sweet dream . __eou__ Are you sleepy ? __eou__ A little bit . I have to go to sleep though I don't want to . __eou__ Yes , I do not want to see ur sleeping in the office . __eou__ Thx.Bye for now . Kisssssssssss . __eou__ C U here , honey . __eou__
Hey , what's up ? __eou__ Oh , nothing . __eou__ What were you writing ? __eou__ ( Laugh ) All right . You caught me in the act . I finally worked up the nerve to ask Diana out . I was just writing a note to put on her desk . __eou__ You mean you're going to ask her out in a note ? You big chicken ! __eou__ I admit it . I'm a wuss . I just can't do it in person . __eou__ But , you work with her everyday . __eou__ That's different . When I'm working , I'm in a different frame of mind . But , when I even think about asking her out , I get tongue-tied . At least in a note , I can get the words out without turning beet red . __eou__ You've dated a lot . What's so different about Diana ? __eou__ Well , for one thing , she's gorgeous . She's so upbeat and sweet . Who doesn't like her ? Oh , I don't know . All I do know is that I think we have great chemistry together . But , what if I'm wrong . Maybe she's just been nice to me out of courtesy and doesn't think of me that way . Oh ... forget it . This was a bad idea . __eou__ Well , I guess you don't want this note , then . __eou__ What note ? __eou__ I was looking for you to deliver this note from Diana . She wants to know if you want to go to the office party with her tomorrow night . __eou__ You're kidding ! I can't believe you've been standing this entire time and didn't say anything . __eou__ Sorry . What can I say ? Now , do you want the note or what ? __eou__ Yeah , I want the note . __eou__ Have a great time tomorrow night . __eou__ Thanks . I plan on it . __eou__
So , is L . A . all it's cracked up to be ? __eou__ Well , the stereotype in the movies is that L . A . is a frivolous town with a lot of flaky people . I guess , in the back of my mind , that's what I expected . __eou__ And , is it what you found ? __eou__ Well , it is and it's not . The city of L . A . is much bigger and more diverse than I had expected . There are people here from all over the country and all over world , like New York . I've heard people say that in L . A . , everyone is from somewhere else . Tha's partly true . So , I've met all kinds of people here . What I'm realizing is that the picture of L . A . that's in movies only represents a small segment of the city . __eou__ You're right . Life isn't always like the movies . __eou__
You look like a basket case . __eou__ I'm not surprised . __eou__ What's the problem ? __eou__ My brother in-law just dropped in from the states . __eou__ Yeah , and ? __eou__ I decided to put him up while he's here , big mistake ! __eou__ Why ? __eou__ He's lazy . I tried being a good host , but if you give him an inch , he'll take a mile . __eou__ I guess you think twice next time he comes . __eou__ You can say that again . __eou__ So how long has he here for ? __eou__ Two weeks . If he thinks I'll put up with his attitude that long he's got another thing coming . __eou__ Well , I know you do the right thing . __eou__
Hello , China Southern Airlines . Can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , could I make a reservation to New York on July 21st , next Friday ? __eou__ Sorry , there is no flight available on July 21st . __eou__ That's too bad . What's the earliest flight available ? __eou__ I can give you a reservation on flight No CZ 387 on July 22nd . __eou__ What about the fight schedule ? __eou__ It departs at 12:10 and arrives at 15:10 next day . __eou__ Is it a non-stop flight ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Sounds good . I'd like to take this flight . __eou__ Would you prefer first class or economy class ? __eou__ Economy class . __eou__ And your name , please ? __eou__ Edward Smith . __eou__ Mr . Smith , you can get things fixed through our agencies in Guangzhou . Do remember to bring your passport with you . __eou__ Yes , many thanks . Goodbye . __eou__ Bye . __eou__
A guy in my office got the flu the other day . Today I seem to have come down with it , too . __eou__ Very likely . You have a slight fever . Do you have a headache , too ? __eou__ Yes . I wonder if you could do something to help me recover soon , because I'll be on a business trip in two days . __eou__ Well , you have to let your flu run its course . You must stop working and stay in bed to get plenty of rest . Usually it will take 4 to 6 days to make a full recovery . __eou__ But I'm going on a business trip in two days ! __eou__ Maybe you'll have to cancel it or postpone it . If you go out while you are sick , it won't help you recover . You may even pass your disease on to others . __eou__
You taught at a local school for a year , right ? __eou__ Yes , I was there as an English teacher . __eou__ Did you enjoy yourself there ? __eou__ Sure . I was fond of those lovely children __eou__ So why did you decide to resign ? __eou__ The school is a little bit too far away . I simply want to take good care of my elderly grandfather . __eou__ I see . But why don't you continue to work as a teacher ? __eou__ I think it's better for me to meet new challenges in life . __eou__ So you can have more room for development . __eou__ And I can experience another kind of life style . __eou__ It sounds like a good idea . __eou__ I hope I can adapt to the new job as soon as possible . __eou__
I have here our price sheet on a F . O . B . basis . The prices are given without engagement . __eou__ Good , if you ’ ll excuse me , I ’ ll go over the sheet right now . __eou__ Take your time . __eou__ I can tell you at a glance that your prices are much too high . __eou__ I ’ m surprised to hear you say so . You know that the cost of pro - duction has been skyrocketing in recent years . __eou__ We only ask that your prices be comparable to others . That ’ s reasonable , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Well , to get the business done , we can consider making some concessions in our price . But first , you ’ ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us , so that we may adjust our prices accordingly . __eou__ The size of our order depends greatly on the prices . Let ’ s settle that matter first . __eou__ Well , as I ’ Ve said , if your order is large enough , we ’ re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent . __eou__ When I say your prices are much too high , I don ’ t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent . __eou__ How much do you mean then ? Can you give me a rough idea ? __eou__ To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help . __eou__ Impossible . How can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ? __eou__ I think you are as well - informed as I am about the market for chemical fertilizers . It ’ s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet . May I suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say ? __eou__ Very well , I will . __eou__
We are willing to participate in the bid which you advertised in China Daily . Would you please tell me the detail of the tender conditions ? __eou__ You will receive the tender notice next month and you'll find the information . __eou__ OK ! Our company is very interested in the tender . I am sure that we will do our best to win the bidding in building the factory . __eou__ I believe your corporation will try your best and I understand fully your feeling , if your tender conditions proved be suitable for our general conditions of tender , we will accept your submission of tender . __eou__ Maybe I have asking too many questions today . __eou__ That's all right . You can contact me later if you have other questions after you read the tender notice . __eou__ Fine , thanks a lot . Bye ! __eou__ Bye ! __eou__
Mom , what were movies like when you were a kid ? __eou__ Everything about them was different , even the theaters . __eou__ I'm really interested . Tell me about them . __eou__ Well , where I grew up , we saw movies at a drive-in theater in our car with the whole family . __eou__ That's cool . I bet you could bring your own food . __eou__ We did . On hot days , we'd take a blanket and lay in the back of dad's old pickup to watch the movie . __eou__ Why don't we do that anymore ? __eou__ Well , the weather might have some influence , during bad weather the theater didn't make a whole lot . __eou__
Do I have to deposit my handbag at the checkroom ? __eou__ No , you do not have to . The handbag can be taken with you . There is the cart at the entrance . __eou__ Thank you . I'd tike to buy some milk powder for my baby . Is there anything that you can recommend for me ? __eou__ Well , how old is your baby ? __eou__ No more than three . __eou__ The milk powder on the second level of the shelf is for the kids from 2 ages to 4 ages . I advice that you should buy the Wyeth brand , the source of milk is imported from New Zealand . __eou__ How about its quality ? __eou__ You can be assured of it . There are various nutritions which are beneficial for the growth of babies ' bone and cerebrum . __eou__ OK , what is this ? __eou__ It is feeding-bottle as the free gift . __eou__ It is thoughtful . I will take it . __eou__
This place is great . I'm surprised there are so many things here . __eou__ Yes , but it takes a while to find things . It's not organized as carefully as a regular store . __eou__ What's the difference between an outlet and a regular store ? __eou__ Usually a clothes company will send their overstock to an outlet . The prices are very low . But you may find faulty products here too . __eou__ Faulty products ? __eou__ Yes . Sometimes the fault is very small ; if you have a needle and thread , you can fix it yourself . So it's a good deal to buy it . __eou__ Oh , that's easy for me . I think it's really a good deal . __eou__ Yes . You can save a lot of money in this way . __eou__ That's great for me . Look , children's clothes ! I'd like to buy some winter clothes for my son and daughter . __eou__ Why not buy the sweater ? It only costs 30 Yuan . __eou__ Yes , I'll take it . Are there any jeans ? Xiaohui's jeans are always dirty . I also need four pairs of slippers . __eou__ How many do you want to buy ? __eou__ I ought to make the most of it while I'm here , don't you think ? __eou__ You're right . __eou__
Egg , this bathroom is a pigsty ! __eou__ Helen , why do you keep flushing the toilet ? What's wrong ? __eou__ I just can't stand it . It's really gross in here ! There ' s a stain on the toilet seat , and the floor was wet and slippery . So I cleaned it ! __eou__ You did what ? Helen , I know it's gross , but I ' Ve seen many public washrooms that are much worse . Why are you cleaning the counter top ? are you out of your mind ? __eou__ I can't help myself ; it's just so disgusting in here ! __eou__ Helen , this is not like your own bathroom . Just leave it to the cleaners , okay ? __eou__ Hang on . I'm just gonna quickly wipe the sink and sweep the floor . __eou__ You're such a neat freak ! I'm outta here ! __eou__
Wow ! Your fruit looks really fresh ! How much are these apples ? __eou__ The apples are 30NT each . How many would you like ? __eou__ Let's see , 30NT is about ... almost a dollar US . What ? ! How about these pineapples ? __eou__ They're 250NT each , but they're not edible . They're only used for worship . __eou__ Hmm , 250NT is ... 8 dollars ? ! ! And you can't even eat them ? You're crazy ! __eou__ Wait ! Don't go just yet . These bananas are pretty cheap--only 35NT for this bunch . __eou__ Now that's more like it ! Bananas have lots of potassium , too ! __eou__ They're also good for your digestion ! Would you like some kiwis , too ? __eou__ Are they from Taiwan ? __eou__ They're imported from New Zealand . Four for 50NT . Nine for a hundred . __eou__ OK . I'll take four kiwis . __eou__
Emily , are you getting rushed by a sorority ? __eou__ More than one . I think the count is now three , if I remember correctly . __eou__ Wow . I'm getting rushed too , but just one . Are you thinking of joining any of them ? __eou__ I don't know . I know there are advantages to joining , but I'm not much into group stuff . __eou__ The guys I've talked to say that the activities that go on in a frat house can be a little distracting depending on the group . __eou__ I think I'm going to decline . I just prefer to do my own thing . __eou__ Were your parents involved in that kind of thing at all when they went to school ? __eou__ My dad was , but not my mom . __eou__
Do you like swimming ? __eou__ Yes . Swimming is one of my most favorite sports , indoors or out-doors . __eou__ Me too . Swimming is a very good exercise for health . It combines water , bath , sunbath , and air bath together . It promotes the growth and haleness of muscles , bone , viscera and nerve systems . __eou__ I have never thought that swimming can bring us so many benefits . I only know that swimming in great waves and deep running water can train people's spirits , and enable people to be fearless of the hardships , dangers and difficulties and become brave and staunch . __eou__ Have you ever swum in a river or a lake ? __eou__ Yes , but not always . However , I won't let it go if I have a chance . __eou__
Give me your hand . ( takes Rose's hand ) Close your eyes . Go on . ( Rose closes her eyes ) Step up . Now hold on to the rail . Keep your eyes closed ; don't peek . __eou__ I'm not . __eou__ Step up onto the rail . Hold on . Keep your eyes closed . Trust me ? __eou__ I trust you . __eou__ All right , open your eyes . ( Rose opens her eyes . She stretches her arms , and Jack stands behind her , arms around her . ) __eou__ I'm fling , Jack . ( singing ) Come , Josephine , in my flying machine . Up she goes , and up she goes ... __eou__
Jane's mother always wants her to marry a big shot . J __eou__ That is just wishful thinking . The cost of higher education has increased in recent years , faster than the cost of living . So she wants Jane's brother to go on studying and earn his doctorate by means of it . __eou__ But it's unfair for Jane . __eou__
Who ’ s that ? __eou__ It ’ me . Susan Taylor __eou__ Oh , please come in . nice to see you . __eou__ On , what ’ re you doing ? You look as busy as a bee . __eou__ Yeah , I ’ m trying to decorate my house . __eou__ Really , that ’ s cool . Let me see what you ’ Ve done . __eou__ But actually it ’ s not done yet . I ’ m going to get a special pendent lamp . __eou__ That ’ s all right . Let me see , oh , that lace looks so unique , and it ’ s so creative to make a picture display here . How did you get that idea ? __eou__ It ’ s just a simple decorating . I just want to add my personality to my living space . __eou__
Is everything ready for Billy ’ s birthday party ? __eou__ Yes . I ’ Ve finished making the birthday cake and I ’ Ve put all the things on the table . Did you find the party hats ? __eou__ Yes , I did . I ’ Ve put one on the table for each child . I put up the big “ happy birthday ” sign too . __eou__ Thanks . Do you think we have enough for the kids to eat and drink ? __eou__ I ’ m sure of that . There ’ s enough food here to feed an army ! __eou__ That birthday cake looks wonderful , but you haven ’ t put any candles on it yet . __eou__ Thanks for reminding me . I ’ Ve prepared some party games for the children too . __eou__ I ’ Ve brought a tape with lots of children ’ s songs on it . __eou__ Hopefully , that will keep everyone happy . __eou__
Come on , Tara . Let ’ s go up to the window and buy two tickets . The movie is starting in a few minutes . __eou__ We can ’ t break into the line . Don ’ t be so impatient . We ’ ll be at the front of the line soon . __eou__ Two tickets , please . How much are they ? __eou__ Oh no , Ari . I didn ’ t mean for you to pay for me when I invited you to go tonight . Let ’ s go Dutch . I ’ ll pay my own way . I insist . __eou__ I ’ m looking forward to this film . I read a good review of it in this morning ’ s newspaper . __eou__ Me , too . It will be great to see something light and funny for a change . I ’ m tired of heavy drama . __eou__ Are these seats okay ? __eou__ They ’ re fine , but I can ’ t watch a movie without popcorn . __eou__
You really should stop smoking , you know . __eou__ I know . I know . I don ’ t smoke too much , though . __eou__ How many cigarettes do you smoke a day ? __eou__ About a pack , more if I drink . __eou__ Wow . You ’ re really a heavy smoker . __eou__ No , I ’ m not . My father smoked two packs a day for forty years . __eou__ He died of lung cancer , right ? __eou__ Yeah ... you ’ re right . I really should stop smoking . __eou__
I know I ’ m going to bite the dust going down this hill . I almost got killed on the chair lift ! This is going to be so embarrassing . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . Everyone knows you ’ re getting your feet wet . I ’ ll show you how . I bet you ’ ll be proficient at this in five minutes . __eou__ This is only your second time skiing . This is definitely a case of the blind leading the blind . __eou__ Relax . I can hold my own . Now , point your skis toward the bottom of the hill . Easy does it ! __eou__ I don ’ t think I can get up enough nerve to do this . __eou__ Here . I ’ ll just give you a little push ... __eou__ No ! ! ! __eou__ There . Now , wasn ’ t that fun ? As soon as you get a second burst of energy , we ’ ll ... __eou__ Don ’ t hold your breath ! __eou__
But it's the White House . The president and his family live there.They won't let us see most of it . Probably we can only see a couple of rooms . __eou__ No , that's not true.The White House is very big . And there are a lot of historical exhibits there.The tour will take us through many different rooms . I read about it in the guide . __eou__ Hmm . If that's true , then the security there must be very good.Because it's strange to think they will let people walk around in the White House . __eou__ I'm sure the security is very tight.Probably they will make us walk through metal detectors like at the airport . __eou__ So I can't take my gun then . __eou__ Don't always joke like that ! You don't have a gun . __eou__ Yes , it's true I don't . __eou__ You shouldn't say things like that . You could get arrested ! __eou__ What ? Do you think someone will arrest me for making a joke ? Someone will arrest me here at the breakfast table ? __eou__ No . But if you say something like that in the White House , they may take it seriously . Sometimes I think you joke too much . __eou__ I'll be careful . Don't worry . I don't want to get arrested by the FBI.But how long does the White House tour last ? __eou__ I'm not sure . I think it lasts about one hour . __eou__ Alright . We should take a taxi over there right after breakfast . __eou__ First I want to look in the travel guide.Maybe they don't have tours in the morning . __eou__ That's a good idea . Do you want some more coffee ? __eou__ No , I'm fine . __eou__
Where is the boss ? I need him to sign a few documents . I checked in his office , but he is not there . Is he out of the office now ? __eou__ Yes . Today is Tuesday , so the boss went off to his MBA seminar class . He is out of the office every Tuesday and Thursday mornings , and he has classes all day Saturday and Sunday . __eou__ What's he studying ? __eou__ He is finishing up a special continue education program for executives . He can continue working , taking a few of classes here and there , and in 2 years he will complete his MBA . __eou__ Sounds like a tiring schedule.He ’ s probably got a lot of homework too , eh ? __eou__ The classes have him out of the office , so that is stressful for him . But as far as homework goes , it is a breeze for him . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ He just has his secretary do his homework for him . __eou__
This is our first day of class.It ' s better for us to introduce ourselves to each other . Who would like to begin first ? Any volunteers ? __eou__ I'd like to introduce myself first . __eou__ Yes , please . __eou__ My name is Gavin White . I was born and raised in London . After high school , I went to Edinburgh University . I worked for one year to pay for my tuition and then got my Bachelor ’ s degree there . Now I've come here to get my Master ’ s degree . I am glad to meet all of you and I hope we will become good friends . __eou__

What happened to Ad ? __eou__ Darling found out he was having a fling , and one new girl found out about Darling she dumped him too . __eou__ Was , talk about a double whammy . __eou__ Ya . And now I can break this to you . Fanny is moving . __eou__ Oh , right . What a load off my mind . I really don ’ t like her . __eou__ Well I have to go , Rock Sam . You take it easy , OK . __eou__ Thanks for the visit , Betty . __eou__

The most popular fruit are apples , bananas , pears , peaches , grapes , and oranges . Do you like vegetables ? __eou__ I like them very much . We also eat a lot of vegetables in my country , buy we eat different kinds . __eou__ Which kinds of vegetables do people in your country usually eat ? __eou__ We eat a lot of sweet corn , broccoli and eggplant . __eou__ I love eggplant ! Unfortunately , it ’ s quite expensive in my country , so I don ’ t eat it often . __eou__ Why is it relatively expensive ? __eou__ Because we don ’ t grow it much in my country . We import a lot from other countries . __eou__ I see . We grow a lot of fruit and vegetables in my country . We export a lot of melons , grapes , oranges and lemons . In your country , do you eat corn on the cob ? It's very popular in my country . __eou__ We eat it in my country too , but I wouldn't say it ’ s very popular . Most people buy frozen sweet corn from their local supermarket . __eou__ Do people usually buy frozen vegetables in your country , it ’ s very rare in mine . __eou__ A lot of younger people like to buy large packets of mixed frozen vegetables . Peas and sweet corn have been sold frozen in my country for many years . I prefer to buy fresh vegetables . __eou__

this bloody computer ! __eou__ what seems to be the problem ? __eou__ my computer just crashed again for the third time today ! __eou__ what were you doing when it crashed ? __eou__ i was just opening up an attachment in an email about winning the lottery . __eou__ I think that might have been a virus . __eou__ oh , no !

I'll call them now . Thanks for your help ! __eou__

One should never do anything one is not interested in . To me , pleasant working conditions with co-operative staff are also important . __eou__

If you ordered a larger quantity we could drop the price a little . Can you increase your order to 15,000 ? __eou__ Hmmm.It wouldn ’ t be easy , but if the discount makes it worthwhile , we can consider it.How much of a discount would that give us ? __eou__ For order of 12,000 or more we charge only $ 1.5 a doll . your total cost would be $ 18,000 . __eou__ So , for an additional 6,000 dollars , we get twice as many dolls ?

But what are you worried about ? __eou__ I'm afraid I was too rude . __eou__ Rude ? You weren't rude at all , Annie . Why do you think you were rude ? __eou__ Well , I maybe talked to Mr . Drummond too directly . I thought I maybe said too much . I don't want him to be angry . __eou__ I understand . But really you weren't rude at all.You said what you thought . I think he appreciates that . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ But I am new here , and I'm not sure he is used to that . __eou__ You mean because you are a woman ? __eou__ Yes . And he is the president of the company . __eou__ Listen , Annie . You shouldn't worry about Mr . Drummond.He is a very good man to work for . He is not sexist at all.He appreciates people for their ideas.And he is willing to take suggestions from men or women . __eou__ I am very happy to hear that , Karen.It ' s good to know I'm working in such a company . __eou__ I agree with you on that , Annie .

Do you think I'm doing a good job here ? __eou__ well , you are a very hard-worker . __eou__ I try very hard . The problem is , my salary just isn't enough to live on . Now that I have a wife and a child to support , we hardly have enough money for food and rent . __eou__ there are trying times for everyone . What do you propose ? __eou__ I could really use a 5 % rise . __eou__ that's quite a bit . If I give you a raise , I'm going to have to give everyone a raise . __eou__ listen , if you give me a raise , I'll take on extra responsibilities . __eou__ that sounds reasonable . How about this , from now on , you can be responsible for scheduling . That means that if you can't find someone to cover a shift , then you'll have to do it . __eou__ that's fine . Do I get over-time for any extra hours that I work ? __eou__ of course . It's be against the law if we didn't . __eou__ that sounds good to me . I really appreciate it . __eou__ you are welcome . Come in early tomorrow and I'll show you how to do the scheduling . __eou__
So how did your end-of-the-year review go ? __eou__ Oh , it was okay . I had my meeting with Mitch this morning and his bottom line is that he thinks I need to show more initiative . He thinks that I need to start being more creative . __eou__ Did he actually say that ? __eou__ Well , not in so many words . But I know that productivity is a big issue for him . Oh , he said the usual things like “ Keep up the good work ” and “ Thanks for your hard work , ” but he also said that he's thinking about bringing some employees into my department . That , to me , means he's not satisfied with what I've been doing . __eou__ Are you sure you're not reading too much into what he said ? __eou__ No , I Don't . Either I shape up or my job is on the line . __eou__ Well , I think you may be overreacting . Mitch likes to give everybody constructive criticism and I think that's what he was doing . __eou__ Do you really think so ? __eou__ Yes , I do . If you ask around , other people will tell you the same thing . __eou__ Maybe you're right . Thanks , Don . I feel better . __eou__ I'm glad to hear it . __eou__

You know , there are many foreign customers like you here . And I think it's good for me to improve my oral English . __eou__ Oh , are you an English student ? Or you just study English for interest's sake ? __eou__ No , I'm not an English student . But I do like English . I'm going to be a volunteer in the 2008 Olympics where I want to be helpful with the language . So I try to improve my English . __eou__ Very nice . Thank you for your time . __eou__ Thank you , sir . But I'm not allowed to accept any tips . __eou__ OK then . I don't want to put you in trouble . __eou__ Well , would you like something else ?

Who's that tall guy over there ? __eou__ Oh , that's George . He looks very drunk . __eou__ What's he like normally ? __eou__ Oh , he's really reserved , normally . But , from what I hear , he's got lots of problems . __eou__ Really ? What kind of problems ? __eou__ Well , off the record , of course , but I hear that he's got terrible debts . He has his own company , and it's not going very well . __eou__ Really ? Well , I hate to say this , but I'm not surprised . __eou__ Really ? What makes you say that ? __eou__ Well , he doesn't look very honest . __eou__ I know , that's the problem . He can't find any customers . It's a pity , really , because his products are very good . Oh , that reminds me . Did I tell you about my new laptop ? __eou__ Oh , don't talk to me about laptops . Mine crashed on Friday and I lost everything . I hate them . __eou__ Oh , really ? __eou__ Look , I need another drink . Do you want one ? __eou__ Yes , I'll have another cocktail . __eou__ Vodka martini ? __eou__ Absolutely . __eou__ I'll be back in a sec . __eou__ OK . I'll wait here for you . __eou__
You are seemingly upset . What's behind you ? __eou__ Arden wants to have a trademark for our new series of products registered . But I have no idea on the registering process . __eou__ That's not as complicated as you suppose . __eou__ Is it so easy ? I never experienced this . Can you tell me something about it ? __eou__ It is known that there is a time limit for trademarks . And we should not have a similar trademark with the one in the same field . __eou__ Based on what you said , does it mean that we can not have a trademark like ' genova ' , right ? __eou__ Correct . And our country follows the priority of use principle . __eou__ Can you tell something about the preparation for the register ? __eou__ Some relative documents will be needed and the fee may be quite dear . So you need to learn more about the process and regulations about this issue . __eou__
Good evening , Mr . Lee and thank you for choosing our airline . We have just discovered that this flight is overbooked . Would you like to volunteer to give up your seat ? __eou__ Overbooked ? Give up my seat ? I don ’ t understand . __eou__ From time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft . That ’ s overbooked . __eou__ I know what overbooked is , I just don ’ t understand how that could happen ? __eou__ Actually it ’ s a common practice to overbook , as passengers often don ’ t take their flight as scheduled . Most of the time there is no problem but today , more passengers arrived than we have seats , __eou__ So who has to stay behind ? __eou__ Well , first we ask for volunteers . If someone like yourself volunteers , they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year . If no one volunteers we just have to select someone . __eou__ Ok . I ’ ll volunteer . I could use a free ticket ! __eou__

Put on the news . I got up late and missed it . __eou__ All right . __eou__
So , what happened ? __eou__ He never came . __eou__ He stood you up . __eou__ I wouldn ’ t exactly characterize it in that way . I think something happened . Something terrible and unexpected that made it impossible for him to ... what if he showed up , took one look at me and left ? __eou__ Not possible . __eou__ Maybe , there was a subway accident . __eou__ Absolutely . __eou__ A train got trapped underground with him inside . __eou__ And no phone . __eou__ And you know , how those express trains create suction . __eou__

You know , I really don ’ t think Americans are very romantic . __eou__ Where did you get that idea ? __eou__ That ’ s the impression I get from the movies , and from looking around . Men and women seem very business-like in their relations with each other . __eou__ Well , I ’ m still not sure what you ’ re asking me . __eou__ Is it true or isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Do you want to know something about the American character ? __eou__ I just think you ’ re trying to change the subject . But go ahead . __eou__ No , this will help answer your question . In American society boys and girls are raised together . They ’ re not segregated in their activities ! Boys and girls go out together from an early age . __eou__ OK , go on . __eou__ After being raised together , men and women can be business-like in each other ’ s company . It really doesn ’ t have anything to do with the way a man and woman behave toward each other when they are in love . Does that answer your question ? __eou__ Not exactly , but I see your point . __eou__ I think Americans are pretty romantic when they are in a relationship and a lot of flirting goes on in every office . After you ’ Ve been in America for a while , you will probably see what I mean . __eou__
Hey Kevin , what are you doing here ? Don't you usually spend Tuesday nights at home studying ? __eou__ I needed to get out of the house . My parents just went ballistic over something my older sister told them . __eou__ What did she tell them ? Is she dropping out of college ? __eou__ Nothing that serious . She finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend . __eou__ And your parents took it badly ? __eou__ That's putting it mildly . My father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her . __eou__ Ouch , that sounds bad . What did your sister do ? __eou__ She started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend , how they're in love and it's not hurting anybody , and so on . My dad said she's too young to do this , and that she should move out right away . __eou__ How long has your sister been with her boyfriend ? __eou__ Three years . They've been dating since freshman year . They're even talking about marriage . __eou__ Really ? Then I guess living together would be a good idea . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Well , these days too many people are getting divorced . If they live together , then at least they're finding out if they're really compatible or not . __eou__ I guess so . Better to find out now than after you're married , when it's harder to get out . __eou__
Hello . Excuse me . __eou__ Yes . Can I help you ? __eou__ Do you remember me ?

You didn't find a wallet ? __eou__ No , I didn't . Would you like to go look by the table with me ? __eou__ Yes , I would . It's not here . And it's not on the floor.Has anyone sat at this table since we left ? __eou__ No . It's been empty the whole time . __eou__ Hmm . I don't know how it could have happened . __eou__ I remember , sir , that your friend took the bill.You didn't pay for the lunch yourself , did you ? __eou__ No . My friend did . __eou__ Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ? __eou__ No , I'm not sure . But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down.It ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . So I usually put it next to me on the table . __eou__ Maybe you lost it before you came here . Or maybe you left it at home . __eou__ I don't think it's at home . I think I had it when I left the house.But what should I do ? __eou__ Well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home.Then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . Next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver's license , things like that . __eou__ Should I call the police ? __eou__ You can if you want . But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets . __eou__ Hmm . I'll go home and check . Maybe you're right . Maybe it's at home . __eou__ I'm sorry we couldn't find it , sir . __eou__ Thanks for your help . __eou__
Mary , come here . I've found the book our teacher recommended us to buy last week . __eou__ Really ? How much is it ? Oh , it's 42 yuan ! How expensive ! __eou__ You know , it is the best seller for this year . It has had its fifth impression since its publication early this year . __eou__ How come ? I have never seen such a popular book before . __eou__ Wait a minute . I found there were two printings . The paperback books must be much cheaper . __eou__ You are right . Let's buy the cheaper one . __eou__
Julia , burglaries in our town have been on the wing . __eou__ Why do you say that ? __eou__ I heard that a robbery happened in our town several days ago . The robbers ripped off a car in broad daylight . __eou__ Thank God , we haven't encountered a burglar . I hope that our house is secure against burglary . __eou__ I am worrying about it too . I want to install a security door . __eou__ Is the security door useful ? __eou__ Yes , I think so . The security door is so firm that nobody can break in . __eou__ I totally agree with you . In this way I won't be afraid of the burglar if you are away . __eou__ OK , I will do it right now . __eou__
They're here ! Now that's speedy service ! And they arrived within two days of each other ! __eou__ What are you waiting for ? Rip ‘ em open ! __eou__ Wow ... this shirt is nice , but looks big . __eou__ It's nice , but how much did you end up paying ? __eou__ With the shipping included--seventy dollars . __eou__ Hmm ... not so hot . They sell them here for about that . __eou__
Hi , my name is Pete . You are Ann . Isn't that right ? __eou__ Hi Pete , how do you know my name ? __eou__ Do you see that girl in the red top ? She told me who you were . __eou__ Oh Andrea , the Spanish girl ? __eou__ Yes , that's her . __eou__ I met her last week at a party . Anyway , you must be from the United States ? __eou__ Actually I live in London , but my family lives in Seattle . __eou__ Oh , I am from London as well . __eou__ Where in London do you live ? __eou__ In Wimbledon - quite close to the tennis courts actually . Which is very nice because I love tennis . __eou__ I play tennis there every week . Shall we have a game one day ? __eou__ That would be lovely . But now let's go and get a drink . __eou__
Could you give us a detailed description of the properties of your product ? __eou__ OK . The X2500 has the unique feature of providing better data flow with less input time . It will reduce your work load at the office . __eou__ Could you tell me more about it ? __eou__ Of course . One of the real pluses of this product is that it is of very high quality , and of compact size . No one can match us so far as quality is concerned . __eou__ Can you introduce its price level to me ? __eou__ We have this item in three price level . __eou__ We need the best possible quality . __eou__ That means this one . __eou__ I see , that's what I will order . __eou__
Johnny , are you just sitting around again ? __eou__ I'm just taking a break between washing the windows and cleaning the toilet . __eou__ I'd say all you've done is moved the dirt from the windows on to your face and hands . Disgraceful ! __eou__ I'm doing my best , Grandma ... __eou__ Your best isn't good enough . Back in my day , I'd clean a whole hospital with a toothbrush and spit , and it'd be twice as clean as this sty ! __eou__ Uh-oh , here we go ... __eou__
What's Ron Marston like , Pauline ? __eou__ He's awful ! He telephoned me four times yesterday , and three times the day before yesterday . He telephoned the office yesterday morning and yesterday afternoon . My boss answered the telephone . __eou__ What did your boss say to him ? __eou__ He said , Pauline is typing letters . She can't speak to you now ! " Then I arrived home at six o'clock yesterday evening . He telephoned again . But I didn ’ t answer the phone ! __eou__ Did he telephone again last night ? __eou__ Yes , he did . He telephoned at nine o'clock . __eou__ What did you say to him ? __eou__ I said , This is Pauline's mother . Please don ’ t telephone my daughter again ! __eou__ Did he telephone again ? __eou__ No , he didn't ! __eou__
So what do you feel like doing this evening ? How about going to the cinema ? __eou__ Ah , that's a good idea . But I heard the film club of our school would show a film for free . Maybe we don't need to go to the cinema . __eou__ That's good ! I've also heard there will be a party held by the Students ' Union tomorrow evening . Would you like to go with me tomorrow night ? __eou__ I'd like to , but I'm afraid I can't . __eou__ Why ? Do you have to prepare for your examination ? Oh , come on , girl , relaxation is also very important . __eou__ That's not the reason . I have to go to the English Corner tomorrow evening . You know , I've been going there every week . __eou__ Oh , God , I've forgotten it . __eou__ You said you wanted to improve your English , so how about coming with me tomorrow ? I can also introduce some friends to you . __eou__ Oh , no , I don't want to know any more geeks like you . __eou__ They are not geeks . They are also interested in singing , dancing , and so on . They are excellent , and they can always help me a lot . __eou__ Really ? Is there a foreign teacher for every class ? __eou__ It depends . If they are not busy , they will come to join us , and talk with us . __eou__ So you just talk all the time ? __eou__ Of course not . The foreign teachers also teach us English songs , and play games with us . __eou__ That sounds interesting . I'll go with you tomorrow evening . __eou__ You won't be disappointed . __eou__
Do you have any year-end benefits ? __eou__ I don ’ t know till now . __eou__ I just saw a piece of news , that a group of white color workers hold a flour war in the office because of dissatisfaction of the year-end benefits . __eou__ Why they hold a flour war ? __eou__ They got rice , flour and oil as presents , while the leadership got 1000 yuan shopping card . __eou__ They are not feeling satisfied ? __eou__ It is said that the presents they got value less than 200 yuan , and it is no use for them at all , because they don't cook by themselves . __eou__ But how guilty to waste food ! __eou__
Hi , Sara , what are you reading ? __eou__ Hi , John , I am trying to find a carpenter . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Well , I want to build a deck in my back yard . __eou__ What for ? __eou__ So I can have a special place to hang out with friends , and also do some barbecuing on weekends . __eou__ That sounds cool . Do you mind if I recommend myself for the job ? __eou__ You ? Do you have a carpenter's license ? __eou__ Yes , of course . But I only freelance on weekends with my uncle . __eou__ Wow ! That's cool . So , let me give you some details about the deck I want . __eou__ Please go ahead , I am listening . __eou__ I'd like my deck to be at the same level as the back door . __eou__ Is your back door higher than the ground level ? __eou__ Yes , the back door is about four or five steps higher than the ground . __eou__ Okay , then you need a deck with a guardrail . __eou__ I don't like things to be fancy . __eou__ Don't worry . I will build your deck with a simple but classic look . __eou__ Hmm , that's good . Can you use cedar or redwood to build it ? __eou__ Cedar is a good choice . __eou__ Well , let's take the measurements right now . __eou__
Would you like to have some icecream ? I've got a variety of flavors for you to choose from . I've got strawberry , peach , chocolate , coffee , vanilla and praline . __eou__ Wow ! So many choices you have ! I wish I could , but I just can't . I'm on a diet to lose weight . __eou__ Come on , just a bite . It doesn't really hurt to have just a bite . __eou__ I'd better not . Please don't tempt me . Please ! __eou__ Gee ! You are really strong-willed . __eou__ You're damn right . I'm not so easily coaxed into doing something that I think is wrong . __eou__ Well , I'd better not tempt you . Otherwise , if I give you a piece of cake , you might ask for a glass of milk . __eou__
Mom , is there anything in the fridge I can eat before dinner ? __eou__ There's some leftover pizza from last night . __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ Um , I think there may be some leftover lasagna from the other day . __eou__ Do I have any other choices ? __eou__ There might be some birthday cake left in the freezer . __eou__ Is everything in the fridge leftovers ? I hate leftovers ! __eou__ You can wash the vegetables and cut the chicken and I'll make dinner ! __eou__
Hi . Bob ! We've been working hard at our lessons for a fortnight . So why don't we take it easy this weekend ? __eou__ Okay ! What do you suggest ? __eou__ How about seeing a play ? I hear Hamlet is on at the National Theater . __eou__ Is that so ? Why not ? __eou__ ( looking at a newspaper ) Oh , dear me ! There's no performance at the National theater this weekend . So we have to go to cinema instead . __eou__ What's on ? __eou__ Let me see .. um . Gone With the Wind . It is on at six cinemas on Saturday night . __eou__ That sounds interesting . Which is the nearest ? __eou__ Ah . The Royal , I think . __eou__ What time does it start ? __eou__ Why don't we go to the 7:30 show ? It is convenient to us , I think . __eou__ But we won't have enough time for dinner . __eou__ Do you want to go to the earlier or the later show ? __eou__ Ah ... I fancy going to the later show . __eou__ Then , there's a 9:30 show . __eou__ That's Okay , I think . __eou__ All right . __eou__
I see Mike farmer has make it into the Olympic team . He beat the national record by 0.1 of a second . __eou__ That ’ s great . He ’ s the best runner I ’ Ve seen this season . I ’ m sure he ’ ll win a medal at the Olympics . __eou__ I think you ’ re right . I think we have a very good athletics team . They should do well in the Olympics . How many medals do you think we ’ ll win ? __eou__ I really don ’ t know . I don ’ t think we ’ ll win many gold medals , but I think we should win several silver and bronze ones . __eou__ What do you think our chance are in other events . __eou__ In the last Olympics , we did very well in swimming , cycling and ball sports . I think we ’ ll do well in those same events . __eou__ We might get a gold medal in the sailing too . Our team put in a lot of practice . __eou__ I think we can expect to get between 30 to 40 medals in total . __eou__ You are very optimistic ! __eou__
Frank , I want your advice on something . Some scientists I met at the conference 6 this afternoon have invited me to a party . Actually , they called it an informal get-together . __eou__ And what ’ s the problem ? __eou__ When I asked how people were going to dress , Dr . Lite said it was casual . __eou__ And you want to know what to wear ? __eou__ Well , last night I went out with some journalists for a casual party , but I was overdressed . I wore what I consider casual - - an outfit of skirt , blouse , scarf , and medium heels ... you know . __eou__ That sounds just right to me . What was wrong with it ? __eou__ Everyone else there was wearing blue jeans . Several of the women had on running shoes . I felt out of place . So I have no idea what to wear tonight . __eou__ My guess is you can safely wear last night ’ s outfit to tonight ’ s party . __eou__
Have you seen the tower in front of us . That's the famous Eiffel Tower . It was built in 1889 for the World's Fair . __eou__ How tall is this building ? __eou__ It stands 320m ( 1050ft ) high and held the record as the world's tallest structure until 1930 . __eou__ I have heard its name is connected with someone , is that right ? __eou__ Yes , the towel was named after its designer Gustave Eiffel . __eou__
I've come to hear about your offer . __eou__ We have the offer ready for you . Let me check . 10 boxes with 50 brooches per box , at 20,000 yuan ; 20 boxes with 50 waistbands per box , at 30,000 yuan ; 15 boxes with other ornaments per box , at 7 , 500 yuan , for shipment in June . The offer is valid for five days . __eou__ I can tell you right now that your prices are a little higher than we expected . __eou__ You know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years . The prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where . __eou__ I am afraid I can't agree with you there . I must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies . __eou__ But you must take the design and quality into consideration . You know we are superior to others in design and quality . We have various styles , which the other companies cannot catch up with . __eou__ I agree that yours are of the top . __eou__ Well , since your order is large enough , can you give me a rough idea ? __eou__ To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 % would help . __eou__ Impossible . How about 5 % off ? __eou__ Right . A reduction of 5 % is acceptable . __eou__
Good morning , everyone . Let me introduce myself to you ... __eou__ You don't need to introduce yourself , Yang . You're famous . __eou__ Well , thank you very much but I thought l'd try and chair the meeting by the rule — at least for a while . __eou__ OK , OK ! __eou__ Now , I'd like to get things under way . The main topic on today's agenda is the development of a U . S . sales strategy for the new EBB . I'd like to hear all of your ideas , Mr . Wall , you seem in top form today . Could you start the ball rolling ? __eou__ Uh , oh , sure . Well , I think we should keep in mind that the key to good sales is advertising . __eou__ Well , that's kind of obvious . __eou__ Give me a break , Mr Yang . __eou__ Uh , let's keep this going , shall we ? __eou__
I ’ Ve come to hear about your offer for bristles . __eou__ We have the offer ready for you . Let me see ... here it is . 100 cases Houston Bristles , 57 mm , at 10 pounds sterling per kilogram , C . I . F European Main Ports , for shipment in June 2001 . The offer is valid for five days . __eou__ Why , your price has soared . It ’ s almost 25 % higher than last year ’ s . It would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price . __eou__ I ’ m a little surprised to hear you say that . You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere . __eou__ I ’ m afraid I can ’ t agree with you there . I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ’ Ve received from other sources . __eou__ But you must take the quality into consideration . Everyone in the trade knows that US ’ s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries . __eou__ I agree that yours are of better quality . But there ’ s competition from synthetic products , too . You can ’ t very well ignore that . Prices for synthetic bristles haven ’ t changed much over the years . __eou__ There ’ s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That ’ s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price . __eou__ Well , we ’ ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price . But I ’ ll have to try , I suppose . __eou__
I have learnt how to ride a bicycle . I plan to go to the Water Park by bike this weekend . __eou__ Well , you know , the traffic in Beijing is sometimes dangerous . Therefore , I have to remind you of something . First , you should obey the traffic rules , don't break in the red light . Second , don't play a joke with your friends when riding on the bike . Third , do not hurry up when riding , or would make an accident . Finally , remember come on the left and go on the right ! __eou__ Oh , my dear sister , I am no longer a baby ! __eou__
A report says running red lights causes one thousand traffic accidents every year . __eou__ It ’ s horrible . Why do drivers run a red light then ? __eou__ Maybe they know they shouldn ’ t run a red light , but when they are driving they don ’ t pay enough attention to traffic lights . __eou__ Talking on the cell phone while driving is very dangerous too . It increases the chance of accidents . __eou__ I know . If a policeman catches you using the cell phone while driving , you will be fined . __eou__
That is the most boring , typical gift in the world ! __eou__ I know . But this year I want to get him an interesting tie . Like this one . __eou__ That's not exactly a conversation piece . It's so plain . __eou__ It's perfect ! It's a Dilbert tie ! __eou__ The diagonal black and red stripes are really conservative though ... __eou__ But watch this ... it bends upwards , just like Dilbert's tie . There's a wire inside . __eou__ A fly-away tie ! What a riot ! __eou__
We still have an important attraction . __eou__ What is that ? __eou__ Melbourne Zoo . __eou__ What's special about Melbourne Zoo ? __eou__ The place is a must-see . This zoo was built in 1862 , and it's the oldest zoo in the world , and still among the best . There are more than 3,000 species of animals here , including the popular kangaroos , wallabies , koalas , and wombats . __eou__ Are the animals caged ? __eou__ Most animals are not locked up in tiny cages . Rather , they are set in almost natural surroundings or well-tended gardens . __eou__ That's really special . __eou__ Of course , I'm sure you will like it . __eou__
Hi , Xavier . I'd like to go over the list of jobs for next week's maintenance shut . __eou__ Sure . We've got a lot to do in a short time . We're planning to shut the line at midday on Wednesday and start up again at 6 pm the following day . We might need to extend the shut by about six hours . __eou__ Our production people won't be happy about that . We've got a full order book at the moment . Is there any way you could speed things up ? __eou__ Not really . We need to dismantle the conveyor belt and replace the rollers . __eou__
Can you tell me the differences between a letter and a memorandum , Miss Thong ? __eou__ Certainly . A letter must be sent out of the company and must be mailed or posted . A memorandum is a communication within an organization . __eou__ Should we use the layout we use for a letter when we write a memorandum ? __eou__ No , not necessary . Usually we have a set form which is printed . We just fill in the printed forms and send it to the person or the offices concerned in the company . __eou__ Of course , let me find one for you . __eou__
These three hours chatting with you have been very ... interesting . Could you please tell us why we're here ? __eou__ I want a new brand image . Something creative , something strong . Make no mistake , something with ... resolve ! __eou__ What is our time frame ? __eou__ Let's meet on Friday to discuss your progress . Give me your e-mail address ... umm , I mean addresses ... We'll be in touch . __eou__
Grandpa , this restaurant looks really old ! How long ago was it built ? __eou__ I'm not sure when it started . But I know it's older than me . As a young boy , I used to eat here a lot . __eou__ Oh , it's interesting . Dad told me you brought him here when he was young , too . Now , it's my turn . __eou__ Yeah . We are the VIP customers here . So , what do you want to eat today ? __eou__ I'd like to eat a hamburger and a bottle of coca-cola . __eou__ Hey , kid , that's wrong . It's a Chinese restaurant . Let's eat something traditional . __eou__ Then there is nothing particular I'd like to eat . Grandpa , what's your favorite here ? __eou__ The Chinese rice pudding . Your father loves it , too . You wanna try ? __eou__ Sure . Is it sweet ? __eou__ Yes , of course . But I think they can make you a salty one , too . __eou__ Great , I want it spicy . __eou__ Come on . Don's go too far . __eou__ I want it to be special . And you know that I always like hot food . __eou__ OK then . We shall ask them to put some red chilli on it . __eou__
Do you have to leave soon ? __eou__ No . Actually I can stay longer . Dave called to say that there is a beautiful Chinese girl who ’ s going to pick me up at the school gate tonight at ten thirty instead of eight thirty . __eou__ Oh , that ’ s better . So you don ’ t have to rush . __eou__ Yeah . You know what Dave just said ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ He said I should put on something very nice , because this girl will be my next target . __eou__ He knows you very well . __eou__ He always makes fun of me . He always says things like that . You know the new coming teacher , a Chinese Canadian . He said she would really be my chance . __eou__ I ’ m sure you have chances everywhere . You ’ re handsome , talkative , and got a sense of humor . You must be very popular . __eou__ No , you ’ re kidding . I ’ m not taking it seriously . __eou__
Could you do me a favor and proofread my resume before I send it out to the human resources department ? __eou__ Sure , let me take a look ... Personal Information , Education , Experience , Training ... I think you should add another section for language . You speak three languages , so you might as well put that on your resume . __eou__ But languages don't have anything to do with engineering . Shouldn't everything I put on my resume have something to do with my field ? __eou__ Not necessarily . I think people would be impressed by your language abilities . It says something about your level of intellect and experience . Also , I think human resources directors want to see more of a well-rounded person in a resume . __eou__ It's just a piece of paper , you think that they can tell if I am a well-rounded person by looking at it ? __eou__ Well , you're right , the resume is limited in how much it can tell someone about a person . That's why job interviews are important to let people know the real you that they can't see from a piece of paper . But resumes can be helpful in explaining things and giving a good impression to a potential employer . __eou__
Not only does it centralise management , it also increases the efficiency of funds . We have testimonials from various companies who are very happy with the service . __eou__ Yes , I'm sure you do . It sounds like an excellent service . __eou__ You see , nowadays , a lot of companies are concerned about their group account management . As long as your company meets all the requirements of our Group Account Deposit Service , I would fully recommend it . __eou__ It seems perfect . __eou__ Here are some leaflets detailing everything we've discussed . __eou__ Could you also let me view some of the testimonials ? I'd really be interested to see what other group companies thought of this service . __eou__
Did you ever buy food from the snack stands near our hotel ? __eou__ Yes , several times . __eou__ How do you like them ? __eou__ Not bad . __eou__ I always have the temptation to eat something there . __eou__ Then , why didn't you do that ? __eou__ I don't know how much we can trust them . Do you have any ideas ? __eou__ Some of them , I think , are not good . __eou__ It doesn't taste good ? __eou__ No , I mean some of them are not clean enough . __eou__ That's my greatest concern . But how can you tell which one is clean ? __eou__ I judge by appearances . __eou__ I got it . I think it's worth trying . __eou__ It certainly is . __eou__ I'd like to try some kebab , roasted squid , and many different appealing things . __eou__ Don't try everything at one time , please . __eou__ I see . Thank you . __eou__
Can I help you , Ma'am ? __eou__ I need a phone card for this new cell phone . __eou__ Cool phone . What kind of phone card do you want ? __eou__ It's for my daughter who is still a senior high school student . __eou__ Then the M-Zone will be suitable . __eou__ What's special with the service ? __eou__ You know students use tested message service . And they provide favorable service for that . __eou__ That's nice . And I need a pre-paid phone card . __eou__ Oh , there is a sales promotion for it now . __eou__ Oh , good . Then what is it ? __eou__ If you buy a pre-paid phone card worth 100 yuan today , you will get 50 yuan for free . __eou__ May I have two of them ? __eou__ Sure . As many as you want . __eou__ Okay , then a third one for my husband too . __eou__
Only one . But I wanted to make sure I'd get it . __eou__ Yeah , I really wanted that Chanel bag , too . But just in case you should bid low . __eou__ But there are only two more days until the bidding closes ! __eou__ I bid on a Chanel watch at the last minute , and got it sixty percent off ! __eou__ Oh ... I'm such a newbie . But at least I'm sure I'll get that tennis racket . __eou__ Don't count on it , Babe . eBay is always full of surprises . __eou__ Well ... guess how low the bidding starts on the tennis racket ? __eou__
Are you ready ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Who can tell us something about the author's life ? Volunteer ? __eou__ The author was a famous writer , and he was also a politician . He was born in 1911 and died in 1985 . __eou__ Very good . Sit down , please . Susan , what's the general idea of the text ? __eou__ Can I answer it in Chinese ? __eou__ No , you can't . This is an English class , and you have to express yourself in English . __eou__ Let me have a try . The author takes the characters peculiar to the British people as a topic to show that they are quite different from other nationalities . They are quiet , shy and reserved ... __eou__ Excellent . Class is over . Let's have a break . __eou__
Do you mind if I ask you a question ? __eou__ No , not at all . Go ahead . __eou__ What do you do in order to improve your English ? __eou__ I go to movies ; I go to lectures ; I listen to the radio ; I do lots of things . Most importantly , I practice every chance I get . __eou__ It ’ s a good idea to have a radio , isn ’ t it ? __eou__ Sure . It ’ s like understanding on the telephone — — you can ’ t see the speaker ! It ’ s great for improving listening comprehension . __eou__ It takes a long time to learn a language , doesn ’ t it ? __eou__ It certainly does . But if you practice speaking every spare minute and learn useful sentences every day you can make big progress . __eou__
It's really late but I'm starving . __eou__ Hey , that coffee shop's lights are still on . __eou__ Maybe they have some good pie . __eou__ I would love a really sticky cinnamon bun . __eou__ There was a coffee shop by my house when I was a kid that served cinnamon hot chocolate . __eou__ Mmmm . That sounds like something I had in Mexico once . __eou__ Good stuff ... Oh , no . The door is locked . __eou__ Ohhhhh ! And I just got all my juices going ! __eou__
Have you heard that Tom and his wife divorced ? __eou__ I didn't hear that . But I can deduce the reason . __eou__ Really ? Say it ! __eou__ Tom is a kind guy , but addicted to gambling . He spends all his time gambling in the casino . And his wife can't put up with his incessant gambling any longer , so she divorced him . Is that right ? __eou__ Yeah , quite right . Gambling broke up a happy family . __eou__ Yeah ! Gambling is often a curse . By gambling we lose time and treasure , two things most precious to a man . __eou__ Besides that , many people took to gambling and got in over their heads , and gradually ruined themselves . __eou__ In a word , gambling is a vice . We should be away from it . __eou__
I could get along fine without all the office politics . __eou__ What's going on ? __eou__ There is a position I've had my eye on for several months now and I had good reason to believe that it was mine for the asking . __eou__ So what happened ? __eou__ We were awarded government funding last year and in order to keep it we have to hire so Ay new employees . __eou__ So what does that have to do with this position ? __eou__ Someone in the main office has a nephew who he thinks can slide right into the Management position I wanted . __eou__ All under the precept of keeping the funding ? That stinks . __eou__
Have you considered upgrading your system ? __eou__ Yes , but I'm not sure what exactly I would need . __eou__ You could consider adding a painting program to your software . It would allow you to make up your own flyers and banners for advertising . __eou__ That would be a definite bonus . __eou__ You might also want to upgrade your hardware because it is pretty outdated now . __eou__ How can we do that ? __eou__ You'd probably need a faster processor , to begin with . And you also need a more powerful hard disc , more memory and a faster modem . Do you have a CD-ROM drive ? __eou__ No . __eou__ Then you might want to add a CD-ROM drive too , because most new software programs are coming out on Cds . __eou__ That sounds great . Thanks . __eou__
Hmm , what should I wear today ? __eou__ Come on , you think about what to wear almost every day . There are thousands of clothes in your wardrobe . __eou__ Well , haven't you ever heard people say that there is always one piece of clothes missing from a woman's wardrobe ? __eou__ I have and I can prove that is 100 % true for you . __eou__ Loving to look beautiful is women's nature . In fact , I am thinking about going to my favorite clothing shop today . __eou__ No kidding ! Again ? ! You just went shopping yesterday . You really are a shopaholic . __eou__ Well , I need to change the shoes I bought from Nasi . They are too small . I want to ask them whether they come in a larger size . __eou__ OK . Do you have the receipt with you ? I think they will ask you to show them the receipt first . __eou__
How do you know ? I thought Taiwanese people didn't have garage sales . __eou__ You're right . We're not really into used stuff . __eou__ Well , I've grown to like second-hand things . I wouldn't have gotten through university without them ! __eou__ There aren't many places that sell used things in Taiwan , besides auction websites . __eou__ I use those sites . Hey ! Let's go check out a flea market later . __eou__ Great ! I can teach you men a thing or two about shopping ! __eou__
You want to go to the movies tonight ? __eou__ Sure ! What ' s playing ? __eou__ The new Twilight movie ! __eou__ Twilight ? As in the vampire movies ? No way , I am watching that , but I don ' t understand why everyone is so excited about these films about vampires . It doesn ' t make sense . __eou__ Of course it does . It ' s like a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet . You can see a couple who are in love but can ' t be together because they are so different . And in the fact that immortality and super human strengthen this really sexy and there you have it ! Plus the cast is hip , young people that make the movie even more enticing . __eou__ I don ' t buy into that . I think it ' s just a fad . Pretty soon this will pass and everyone will be into wear-wolves or zombies ! __eou__
What ’ s the area of your country ? __eou__ It ’ s not very big . It ’ s a little over half a million square kilometers . __eou__ That sounds quite big ! How many people live there ? __eou__ There are about 30 million people in my country . Most of them live in the north . __eou__ What ’ s the average income ? __eou__ That ’ s the really hard to say . I think most people earn about two thousand dollars a month , if you convert the money from our currency into dollars . __eou__ So your country is fairly rich . __eou__ I think we are richer than most countries , but not as rich as countries in western Europe . Our biggest problem at the moment is unemployment , which is roughly 8 % . It has doubled over the last four years . __eou__ Unemployment in my country is a fraction of that . __eou__
Hey , Teresa , meet the new neighbors yet ? __eou__ Actually , i popped in them last night . __eou__ OK , let's cut to the chase . what are they like ? __eou__ Well , they're really beautiful people . __eou__ I'll say , she is really stacked , isn't she ? __eou__ Yeah , she is a neck-off for sure . __eou__ And he looks like a typical jog . __eou__ He is a professional football player . __eou__ Ah-ha , I thought so . __eou__ Anyway , that is not what I meant by beautiful . __eou__ What did you mean ? __eou__ I meant that they're very simple , easy to talk to . __eou__ That's right . __eou__ Yeah . I think things are worked out just fine . __eou__
What a wonderful sight ! __eou__ Yes . I've dreamed a thousand times that I could lie down here to relax . __eou__ We are tired of jobs and competition . We need a quiet place . __eou__ I'd like to stay here for all my life if possible . __eou__ So would I . Look , it might be going to rain . __eou__ I don't think it will spoil our trip . __eou__ It will give us better feeling and atmosphere if it rains . __eou__ Let's kick off our shoes to walk on the green flag stoned roads . __eou__ That's a good idea ! __eou__
Daddy , how are you going to spend your weekends ? __eou__ I need to finish my research paper . __eou__ Could you go with me to climb Kiang Shan ? __eou__ Honey , I am sorry I have no time . __eou__ Oh , Daddy , you should do more exercise . You are getting a little heavy . __eou__ I am afraid you are right . Recently , even going upstairs makes me out of breath . __eou__ Then go climbing with me , Daddy . Mountain climbing can build your muscles like Popeyes . __eou__ Terrific ! It is also a good exercise to keep me fit . __eou__ I give you my word , you must feel refreshed after mountain climbing . __eou__ OK , I'll go . __eou__ That's a deal . __eou__ Sure . __eou__
Our usual supplier has let us down and I ’ Ve been looking through your parts catalogue . I need fifty GT670s . How soon can you deliver ? __eou__ Just a moment and I'll check . We ’ re expecting a delivery on Friday . We've only got ten in stock at the moment . I can deliver those by first thing tomorrow morning . There'll be an extra charge for special delivery . I'll have to send them by courier . __eou__
I think we have had a very pleasant conversation , haven't we ? __eou__ Yes , I think so too . __eou__ Do you have any other questions ? __eou__ Let me think ... I want to know if the company can provide free accommodation for a new employee . __eou__ I'm sorry we can't now . __eou__ I really hope that your company could provide living places ; otherwise I have to rent a house to live . __eou__ Maybe the company will build dormitory for the employees in the future . __eou__ That would work too . __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ Some companies will pay part of the phone bills for the employees . Will this company do so ? __eou__ I'm sorry we won't do so for a new employee . We only provide this benefit to employees who have made significant contributions to the company . __eou__ I understand . Will the company provide training ? __eou__ Yes , we will , and the staff will have a chance to travel every year . __eou__ That's great . Thank you very much . __eou__
Hello , Sir . You're here to discuss the Network Settlement Service , right ? __eou__ Yes , that's right . We want as much info as possible before we agree to anything . __eou__ Yes , it's important to be all clued up before you enter into any agreement . To make full use of the Network Settlement Service and take advantage of the whole banking system , we provide internal fund transfers , account inquiry , agency clearing to name but a few . __eou__ So , do you think our corporation will be eligible for this ? __eou__ Yes , and it's extremely simple . All you need to do is make a Network Settlement Agreement with us . __eou__
Good day , Madam . What service do you require today ? __eou__ I'd like some info about your Payroll Services , please . __eou__ It's possible to sign an agreement with us , and then we can pay your staff directly . That is called an Entrustment Agreement . __eou__ I see . How is it paid ? I mean , what payment methods are possible ? __eou__ We can transfer the funds each month , at your request , into each employee's account . It is possible to pay in cash or to pay directly to the employee's savings account , no matter which bank they do business with . __eou__ That sounds pretty good . Tell me , must we use the same payment method for all of our employees ? __eou__ Not at all . We can adjust the payment methods depending on the requirement of each employee . __eou__ That sounds just perfect . I'll talk things over with some colleagues and get back to you . Thank you very much for the information . __eou__
Good afternoon Miss , would you be interested in buying more life insurance ? You know , you can never get enough . __eou__ I think my husband has some . __eou__ Are you sure he ’ s purchased enough insurance for both of you ? If something terrible happened with your husband , and he doesn ’ t have sufficient insurance , my company does have a policy that could cover you and your husband if something happened to either of you . __eou__ That ’ s true . If something happened to my husband , I might lose everything . Both of us have to work to keep our home , car , and our children ’ s education . I can ’ t afford that by myself . __eou__ Could we sit and look at the policy I mentioned and see if that ’ s something suitable for you and your husband ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__
Hello , Janet . __eou__ Good morning , Pete . __eou__ And what is this ? __eou__ Ah , this is my daughter's birthday present . Her birthday is next week . __eou__ And when is your son's birthday ? __eou__ That is not for a while . His birthday is only in August . __eou__ But Mark's birthday is in April so I need to think about his present soon . __eou__ And when is your birthday ? __eou__ Oh , my birthday is in December just before Xmas so of course nobody remembers . __eou__ My birthday is in June , when we are always on holiday . So my family often forgets my birthday too . __eou__
Do you have any plans for Veteran ’ s Day ? __eou__ You mean Armistice Day . __eou__ Well , as you know , on November 11th the allies signed a peace treaty with the Germans , also known as the Armistice Treaty . This marked the end of WWI and many countries around the world commemorate this date under names such as Remembers ’ Day . In Poland it ’ s their independence day ! There ’ s a lot going on around the world on this day . __eou__ Wow , I didn ’ t know ! Probably because I flunked history in school . __eou__
Hey , look ! They ’ re playing reruns of the 1996 Olympics . __eou__ Isn ’ t that Michael Johnson ? I think he set a world record in this race . __eou__ He completed the first 200 / 400 double in Olympic history ! __eou__ Are you sure ? What about Carl Lewis ? He won four golds , didn ’ t he ? __eou__ Carl won the gold in the 100 , 200 , long jump , and 4x100 relay in 1984 . __eou__ I like the way Carl runs . He looks more graceful . __eou__
Here is your room . I hope you like it . __eou__ Looks not bad . __eou__ The room is away from traffic noise . __eou__ Yes , It's pleasantly quiet here . __eou__ Here's the bath . __eou__ Where can we have our laundry done ? __eou__ There's a bag in the bathroom . Just put your laundry in it . __eou__ Does the hotel run its own laundry service ? __eou__ We do , as most hotels do . __eou__ I see . Is the telephone on the table good for outside calls ? __eou__ There is house phone only.But you can ask the operator for city calls . __eou__ Can I get a city map at the hotel ? __eou__ Yes . Shall I get one for you ? Just push the button over there if you need anything . __eou__
Mary , I will have an interview tomorrow . I am so excited ! __eou__ Congratulations ! By the way , have you had all the things ready for the interview ? __eou__ I only typed several copies of my resume . __eou__ That's not enough . You have many other things to prepare . __eou__ What are they ? __eou__ Besides the resume , you also need the original and copies of your graduation certificate and your ID card . __eou__ I see __eou__ Also several copies of your one-inch color photos . __eou__ Yes , I have those . __eou__ You also need to prepare formal clothes for the interview ; a suit should be the best . __eou__ I will get it soon . __eou__ Have a briefcase ready with all your interview materials in it for easy carrying . __eou__ Ok , I will remember . __eou__ All these should be enough . Good luck ! __eou__
Now I understand . But I don't smoke or drink.So what am I supposed to buy in here ? __eou__ You can buy some of these nice butterflies . __eou__ No , I'm sorry . I don't think it is nice to have butterflies mounted in boxes.It is kind of disgusting . __eou__ What ? You feel sorry for the butterflies ? __eou__ Yes . I think they should just let them fly free , and not try to sell them to foreigners . It is a kind of destruction of nature . __eou__ Well , I agree with you . I'd rather think that the butterflies are flying around in the mountains . I just wonder if they really catch so many that it affects the butterfly population . __eou__ Who knows ? Hey , I like these jade bears here . __eou__ How much are they ? __eou__ This one is 2300 dollars.Maybe I should buy it for my mother . What do you think ? __eou__ If you want . Didn't you buy her a small vase already ? __eou__ Yes , but she would like this a lot . She likes to collect little things like this . __eou__ Alright . Buy it then . I won't buy anything . Well , maybe I'll buy some Cognac . __eou__ Maybe I could buy some Cognac for my brother . He always drinks it . __eou__ Let's go ask about it . __eou__

Excuse me , I want to know what's your price per dozen for exercise books ? __eou__ 15 dollars per dozen __eou__ Oh , it's rather too high . We have another offer for a similar one at a much lower price . __eou__ However , the quality of our exercise books is better than others . I can assure you that our price is the most favorable . A trial will convince you of my words . __eou__ If you can go a little lower , I'd be able to give you an order on the spot . __eou__ This price of yours is out of the question . You must know that the cost of production has risen a great deal in recent years . __eou__ I hope you'll give a second thought to it . __eou__ We'll have to discuss the problem later . __eou__ What about if we order a large amount of exercise books ? __eou__ Could you give me an idea of how larger an amount you want ? __eou__ About 300 dozens . __eou__ Then , let me check . For the large quantity you ask , considering the cost of raw materials , I think 13 dollar is our bottom line . And I can assure you this is the lowest price in the market in nowadays . __eou__ OK . That's a deal . __eou__
So where is this mystery restaurant that we are going to ? __eou__ It ' s an Indian restaurant ! I know you have never had Indian food , so I thought you might want to try . __eou__ That sounds great ! I am craving some type of beef dish . __eou__ Well , Indian cuisine actually doesn ' t serve beef . You see , cows are a sacred animal , a very important element in the Hindu religion , so beef is not eaten . __eou__ I see , so what are we having ? Chicken ? __eou__ There are many amazing dishes to choose from . We can have some chicken tikka masala which is an amazing curry . It ' s a bit spicy , but I think you can handle it . __eou__ Sounds good ! I have always heard that Indian spices give a rich flavor to food . __eou__ Yeah . Also , we can have some Naan bread which is baked in a tandoori oven . Since you don ' t use any utensils to eat , you can use this bread to scoop up the curry or rice . __eou__ What about veggies ? __eou__ They have a good variety of vegetable-based dishes like talak panter , vegetable samosas or daal . __eou__ It all sounds exquisite ! I can ' t wait ! __eou__
Did you watch the movie program on Channel 6 last night ? __eou__ Yes , I did . It is a horrible movie . __eou__ I wonder why TV programs often show much violence . __eou__ Actually , more and more people have realized that violence on TV may lead to the increase of crime rates among teenagers . __eou__ They are especially harmful to teenagers . __eou__ But anyhow there are many worthwhile programs . __eou__
Remember that old man who used to beg for money on the street across from our house ? __eou__ Yeah . Whatever became of him ? __eou__ He got a job and now he owns a small grocery in town . __eou__ That's great . We should visit him some time . __eou__
are you good at making decisions ? __eou__ not really . Sometimes , I even let other people make key decision for me . __eou__ what kinds of decisions do you leave to other people ? __eou__ there are basic decisions like which restaurant to go to . I can never seem to choose . I let my parents make big decisions for me . They chose my university and my course . I ended up studying something __eou__ your parents will be choosing your girlfriend if you aren ’ t careful ! Why don ’ t you try being more decisive ? Start with some basic ones . When your friends are discussing which restaurant to eat at , mak __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . You ’ re very decisive , I ’ Ve noticed . So , which bar are we going to this evening ? __eou__ I can ’ t make a decision . You ’ ll have to put forward an idea . __eou__ ok , i choose luckies . __eou__ you see ? You ’ re becoming more decisive already ! __eou__
Hey Lisa ... want to grab lunch with me ? __eou__ Sure , Emily . We haven't done that in a while . __eou__ Yeah ... actually , we haven't hung out at all recently . You seem sort of under the weather . Is there something going on ? __eou__ Well , keep this under your hat , but I think I'm going to quit after New Year . __eou__ Quit this company ? Oh ... wow . __eou__ I know I should be pretty happy here , but I'm not finding the kind of job satisfaction I need . I'm a good graphic designer ... __eou__ One of the best in the company . __eou__ That's kind of you to say . But ... the stuff we do here hasn't really challenged me very much at all . __eou__ Oh , I get it . Simply put , you're bored , huh ? __eou__ That's one way of putting it . For me , a job needs to stimulate my brain , otherwise it becomes a daily drudgery . __eou__
you look better today . How did your test go ? __eou__ much better than it did yesterday . __eou__ did you pass ? __eou__ I not only passed my test , but I aced it ! I'm so happy ! __eou__ you should be . You worked really hard last night preparing for it . __eou__ thanks for helping me with it . If you hadn't encouraged me to do my best , I wouldn't have ever been able to pass . __eou__ you don't have to thank me . It's just a part of my job as your counsellor . __eou__ did you always do well at school ? __eou__ no , in fact , I was terrible at taking exams . __eou__ really ? __eou__ sure , but my teachers always encouraged me to do the best that I could and that helped me a lot . When are your final exams ? __eou__ I'll get my finals in two months . __eou__ when do you plan on studying for those exams ? __eou__ most students just cram the night forehead . __eou__ do you think that's a good idea ? __eou__ no , I think I should study a little bit at a time , starting a few weeks before the exam . __eou__ that sounds like a good idea . What are you going to do if you have any questions while you're studying ? __eou__ I'll go and talk to my professor or a learning support assistant . __eou__ it sounds like you've learned something useful this year ! __eou__
Susan has been down recently . I saw her this morning , she looked terrible ! __eou__ You have any idea why ? __eou__ She broke up with her boyfriend . __eou__ I heard her boyfriend is married . __eou__ She still loves him . That's why she feels upset . Her love is always hard and confusing ... __eou__ Then what about you ? How are you getting on with your boyfriend ? __eou__ He sometimes really drives me crazy . __eou__
Good afternoon . I come here specially to pick up my tickets . I booked it last month.This is my reservation note . __eou__ I am terribly sorry . You didn't come to reconfirm recently.You should have come to pick up your ticket three days ago since it's an international flight , any reservation without reconfirmation within 72 hours will be cancelled . __eou__ But I have been so busy all these days.Well , is there any other ticket available ? I want the next one . __eou__
Come in , please . __eou__ Good morning , sir ! __eou__ Good morning , please make yourself comfortable . __eou__ Thank you , sir . __eou__ Your name and examination number , please . __eou__ My name is Du Tao , number 3 . __eou__ Pardon ? __eou__ Du Tao . D-U for Du and T-A - 0 for Tao . __eou__ Yes , Mr . Du , when were you born ? __eou__ I was born on January 1st , 1988 . I ’ m 20 years old now . __eou__ Where do you live ? __eou__ I ’ m living at Room 222 , Building 18 , N . P . U . __eou__ Can you leave me your phone number ? __eou__ Gladly , 8962105 2 . __eou__
are you ready for the meeting ? __eou__ yes , come on in . how's your new job going ? __eou__ it's challenging , but I'm enjoying it quite a bit . __eou__ that's great . I knew you'd do a good job as a manager . __eou__ thanks a lot . __eou__ how's your assistant manager getting on ? __eou__ well , that's part of the problem . His probation period is up tomorrow and I don't think he's ready to pass . __eou__ what seems to be the problem ? __eou__ well , he was supposed to be able to learn his job in 30 days , but he just doesn't seem to know what he's doing . __eou__ if you gave him another 30 days , do you think he could figure it out by then ? __eou__ to be honest , he has no authority . He's a hard-worker , but no one listens to him . __eou__ I see . Not everyone is cut out to work in management . __eou__ I know . It'd be great if we could transfer him to a department where he doesn't have to work with people . __eou__ there's an opening in the creative design department . It involves working with computers . __eou__ that's perfect . I'll let him know tomorrow . Thanks ! __eou__
That's OK , Ben , just let it go . I thought you were just a little too much into it . __eou__ I wasn't kidding before , OK , I'm fine now . __eou__ Honey , have you ever heard that there are a lot of stray cats now . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Now they are collected by some volunteers , and people can adopt them or make a donation for the shelters . __eou__ What are you saying ? You are acting weird today . __eou__ I want to adopt a cat , and it can be Barbie's boyfriend too . __eou__ Haha , very funny , but it doesn't make any sense to me . __eou__ That's all right . At least I got myself left . __eou__ Seriously , if we will adopt any animals , we'd gotta to talk to Daniel . __eou__ I hope that he would grant me with that . __eou__ Hope so . __eou__
I've heard that you've made a new strange friend recently , Sophie . __eou__ Yes . He is an old man with a great sense of humour . Not only can he play the piano , he also draws pictures very well . __eou__ So you can learn a lot from him . __eou__ Yeah , he has no children , so he sometimes feel s very lonely . I often go to his house to play and talk with him . That makes him feel very happy . __eou__
I went bungee jumping yesterday . It was so exciting . __eou__ Do you really enjoy such dangerous sports ? __eou__ Yes , They are great fun and very challenging , too . Some day I'll want to try deep-sea diving and rock-climbing , too . __eou__ You are a real fan of extreme sports . __eou__ Yes . I love facing danger and overcoming it . It has become part of my life . __eou__
Cindy , how come nearly all the prime-time TV shows are comedies ? __eou__ That's because Americans love sitcoms . __eou__ Sitcoms ? __eou__ Situation comedies . A sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly . Sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people . If there is one thing that all the shows have in common , it is teaching wholesome values . __eou__ In Taiwan , prime-time shows are an hour long and most of them aren't comedies . __eou__ I think Americans would rather laugh than cry or be scared in their free time . __eou__
How do you want to advertise the opening ? __eou__ I've had good responses from the Beijing Times , help-wanted ads . __eou__ All right . I suggest posting the ad Monday through Friday . __eou__ OK . Monday is the big day for job ads . __eou__ And job seekers will certainly check the paper over on Tuesday . __eou__ Let's post on the Internet , too . Will get a better response . I'll post the ads . I know some good sites . __eou__ Such concern for the company , Craig ! I'm impressed . __eou__
Mary , you have found several companies that are hiring , right ? __eou__ Yes , I have found three companies . __eou__ Have you called to inquire about the positions ? __eou__ Yes , but the results are not so satisfying . __eou__ What's the matter ? __eou__ I asked the first company about the vacancy , but they had already hired someone . __eou__ What a pity ! __eou__ The second one told me that the job information was released half a year ago , and had been overdue . __eou__ It's frustrating ! __eou__ The last company is still hiring , but not recent graduates . __eou__ Wonder why they do that ! __eou__ I feel terrible now . __eou__ Don't be discouraged . Just keep trying and you will find a job eventually . __eou__ Thanks for your support and care . __eou__
I am sorry for damaging your car , sir . __eou__ Don't worry about it . Just leave it to the insurance companies . __eou__ The car park in this community is over crowded , isn't it ? __eou__ Yeah , more and more cars . People should try to take public transportation . __eou__ There aren't enough buses in this city , are there ? __eou__ Yeah , sometimes I really feel like writing a letter to the mayor . __eou__ That's too much of hassle . We just want a little bigger parking space . __eou__ Have you taken this to the property management , yet ? __eou__ No . but I'm gonna . You know , several months ago , I backed into red Honda when parking . __eou__ Where ? On the road ? __eou__ No , right here in the parking lot . It was parked right here in your space . The left rearview mirror was smashed . __eou__ Is the car owner a lady with deafening voice ? __eou__ Yes ! How do you know that ? __eou__ That's my wife ! __eou__
I have two finals this week and one oral presentation and I'm not ready for any of them ! __eou__ Sounds like you will be doing some serious cramming till Friday ! __eou__ I hate this part of school . __eou__ Why did you put it off until the last minute ? __eou__ I didn't mean to . Things just kept taking up all of my time . __eou__ Maybe you got your plate too full this semester ? You can change that next semester . __eou__ I think I'd better . I have twenty four credits this time around . That might be a bit much . __eou__ I'll say . The regular eighteen is just about all I can handle myself . __eou__
so , how's your course going ?

Are you doing well in your classes ? __eou__ I don't know because I haven't received my test results yet . __eou__ when did you take your exams ? __eou__ about two weeks ago . __eou__ how do you think you did ? __eou__ I left feeling pretty confident about my score , but I heard that my professors are very strict graders , so I'm a bit nervous . __eou__ I'm sure you'll do well . Did you study hard ? __eou__ You know me ; I'm always studying ! __eou__ don't worry . If you don't do well , no one can ! __eou__ Thanks for the vote of confidence , Justin ! __eou__

Karen and Mike have spoken about you so often that I feel like I've met you before . __eou__ I hope that what they had to say was mostly good ! __eou__ They only said wonderful things about you . You did a good job of finding me . __eou__ Finding the beautiful woman in a red dress next to the fountain wasn't all that hard . __eou__ Yes , I guess it was a choice of me or the pigeons ! __eou__ I was hoping that we could take a walk down the street to my favorite cafe . __eou__ Lunch sounds great ! Let's head on out ! __eou__
So awful ! I never fancy my salary is so little . __eou__ Oh , don't be so sad . You can ask for a salary raise . __eou__ Bingo ! I never thought about that before . I am working so hard and my accomplishment is significant , you know . __eou__ So you suppose you deserve a salary raise . __eou__ I know I deserve it , but I can not find a way to talk with boss about this . __eou__ You ought to point out how valuable you are , and tell her those people who have the same situation also get the salary raise . __eou__ That sounds reasonable . __eou__ Remember it is the boss who hires you and tell her how much you have improved the office efficiency . __eou__ That's a point . It seems a little complicated . I will think about this for a while . I owe you one . After all , you give me an inspiration . __eou__ Forget it . Good luck . I hope you can make it . __eou__
Can you drive ? __eou__ Yes , I have a driving license . __eou__ Are you willing to drive yourself if the job requires ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ One more thing , if you are wanted in this position , you must prepare to travel aboard frequently . __eou__ That's fine with me . __eou__ Would you mind relocating ? __eou__ As long as it isn't too far from this city , I don't mind . __eou__ It ’ s quite far away , though it's located in another part of the city .

Do you have any particular conditions that you want us to take into consideration ? __eou__ No , nothing in particular . Thank you . __eou__ Then you'll need to know it's a hard job .

Welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you ? __eou__ Morning . I'm a new user of your credit card and I was wondering if I'm taking full advantage of it . __eou__ Well , there certainly are many benefits that go along with our credit card . __eou__ Yes , of course . It's so much easier than cash , to be honest ; nowadays I hardly ever use cash . I just put it on the card and pay off the balance every month . __eou__ You know it is not necessary to pay the balance in full every month . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes , you will see on your monthly bill and statement the amount in full but also the minimum payment . __eou__ So , if for some reason I was having a bad month and spent a little too much I could just pay the minimum ? __eou__ Yes . As long as you keep making regular monthly payments , paying the minimum is just fine . Of course , your credit limit will be lowered accordingly . __eou__ How so ? __eou__ For example , if your credit limit is 5,000 RIB and you owe 1,000 RIB , your available credit will be 4,000 RIB . So , your credit limit drops . __eou__ Oh , I see . Well , I don't plan on only paying the minimum , but it's good to know that I can if I had to . Thanks for that . __eou__
I am keen on a coat on www.dingding.com . But it requires having an online banking account . Is it necessary ? __eou__ Indeed .

That will be fine . __eou__ So easy . __eou__ I think online banking can change your money habits and it is quicker than ATM processing speed . __eou__ My shopping life will be more convenient . __eou__

The prices are good . __eou__ I will sometime . Thanks for the advice . __eou__

If I understand the terms correctly , the length of the contract would be one year with a one-year option . Is that correct ? __eou__ Do you mean the contract for equipment rental or the one for training ? __eou__ I was under the impression that both contracts had the same terms . __eou__ Yes and no . Let me see if I can clarify that . The terms are the same except that the contract for training has a clause that allows for the cancellation after the first six months . __eou__ Could you elaborate on that ? __eou__ Sure . What I mean is that either side could cancel the training contract after the six months as long as it's in writing . __eou__ Let me see if I have that right . This contract is for six months of training , but if it isn't cancelled , continues for another six months . Is that right ? __eou__ Yes , that's right . __eou__ Okay , that's clear enough . Let's move on to the other terms . __eou__

Oh , no . __eou__ Listen to me . You go home now . I will call my doctor and have him go over . Ok ? __eou__ What about Mr.White ? __eou__ I'll handle him . Now go home .

It's dark outside , Let's hurry up . __eou__

Who is he ? How did you meet ? __eou__ His name is Tony and we met my first night in Pathos . He works with my sister who lives there . __eou__ Was it love at first sight ? __eou__ Not really . I wasn ’ t looking for a holiday romance , but my sister told me that she had promised him that she ’ d set him up on blind date with me . I didn ’ t think I ’ d have anything to lose , so I went . __eou__ And ? __eou__ Let ’ s just say that by the third date , we both realized that we had fallen in love . __eou__ That happened quickly ! Are you going to see him again ? __eou__ Luckily , his company has a position available here , so he ’ s going to see if he can get relocated . __eou__ It sounds like he is madly in love with you . Are you ready for such a serious relationship ? __eou__ Well , I ’ m not really a spring chicken anymore . We don ’ t know what will happen . __eou__

I love your new three-pieces suite . __eou__ I told you that I had been saving up money to buy some new furniture and do some redecorating .

If I won the Pools , I'd go round the world . __eou__ Would you ? I wouldn't . __eou__ What would you do ? __eou__ Oh , I don't know . I'd buy a big house with a garden for my wife and kids , I suppose . But it's difficult to imagine having a lot of money . __eou__ One thing's certain . If I had a lot of money , I wouldn't work any more . __eou__ Wouldn't you ? What would you do with all that spare time ? __eou__ As I said , I'd go round the world . __eou__ What would you do after that ? __eou__ Oh , I don't know . It'd take me a long time to go round the world . __eou__ It doesn't sound very exciting . __eou__ Anyway , we haven't won the Pools , and we're not likely to win them . So there isn't much point in talking about it , is there ? __eou__ I'd be happy if I got a rise . __eou__ And my wife would be happy if I bought her a mink coat . __eou__ Well , I'm not likely to get a rise and you haven't the money for a mink coat , so let's come down to earth and have another drink . __eou__ What'll you have ? __eou__ I'll have a pint of the best . __eou__ I'd have a Scotch if I were you . We deserve it . __eou__ All right . Make it a double , will you ? __eou__

Before I decided to quit that position , I had made a thorough analysis of things like what I would gain and what I would lose here in your company . You know , Shanghai is always a fascinating place to me , full of challenges as well as hopes . In addition to this , I have the specialized knowledge and the necessary experience of making a good .

Hello ! You have reached the offices of Maddox and McKnight , can I help you ? __eou__ Yes , my name is Max Richards . May I please speak to George Nelson ? I have already called several times . It seems I always catch him out of the office . __eou__ Oh , I'm sorry . Mr . Nelson is away at the moment . I'm sorry that you keep missing him while he is out of the office . Would you like to leave a message ? __eou__ I'm sorry , I didn't hear you clearly . Could you repeat that please ? __eou__ Certainly . Mr . Nelson can not take your call at the moment because he is away . He stepped out of the office for the whole afternoon and is not expected back until tomorrow morning .

I'm sure Mr . Nelson will return your call as soon as he is able . __eou__ My name is Max Richards , my phone number is 898-3423 . Could you ask him to call me back as soon as he gets back , please ?

I'm the Mortgage Advisor at this branch . You wanted a chat about housing loans ? __eou__ Yes , I've found a wonderful property I wish to buy . Unfortunately , I just don't have access to the cash . __eou__ I see . It's a problem most of us face . May I ask what the purchase price is ? __eou__ It's 600,000 RIB . But I've already put down 200,000 RIB , which is my absolute limit , so I'm looking for a loan of 400,000 RIB . __eou__ So , you've already made a large initial deposit ? That is good news . OK , let's have a look at your credit details and get this started . __eou__ I already have an account with you , so it should be pretty straight forward . __eou__ That is good , it should speed things up nicely . __eou__
Good day ! What can we do for you ? __eou__ I'm considering buying a new car , the old one hasn't been running too well recently , and was wondering what kind of credit you can offer me . __eou__ Buying a new car is a big expense ; we understand that , so we have a variety of loans to suit your needs . __eou__ That's great . I'm looking to borrow quite a large sum , though . __eou__ With our Personal Automobile Consumer Loan , the borrower can borrow up to 80 % of the purchase price . __eou__ That's good news . The car I'm interested in is priced at 120,000 RIB , but I think I can get a bit of discount on that . I can afford to put up around 40,000 RIB myself . __eou__ That's great . You will need to make an initial down payment of 20 % , and then we can get going with this . __eou__ The funds are all ready to go in my personal account , so let's transfer it . __eou__
Do you know anything about health food ? __eou__ It is so popular among people to preserve health now , so I read some books about health food . __eou__ Can you give me some examples ? __eou__ Drinking warm and fresh water in the morning on wakening up is one of ways to keep healthy . __eou__ Really ? Why we must have warm and fresh water ? __eou__ Warm water can be good for your stomach , which is empty at that moment . And freshness can keep the water active to clean your digest system . __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ Yogurt , because it has protein , vitamins and it is acidic . If you drink it everyday , your stomach will be more comfortable . __eou__
I don't know what to say . This can't be happening . Here's the obituary . __eou__ It's really there ? This all seems so surreal-like it's all one big nightmare . __eou__ But it explains why Taylor isn't answering and Femi took time off from work . __eou__ Poor Femi . Taylor's death must have made her realize that she still cared for him . __eou__ This says the viewing is at Myers Funeral Home today until five . __eou__ It's already half past four . We should go and pay our respects . Taylor's family will be there . __eou__
Rachel , do you like music ? __eou__ Of course . I can't live without it , so I always bring my CD with me no matter where I go . __eou__ What kind of music do you like best ? __eou__ Light music and classic music . __eou__ Really ? I can't believe this . I am also keen on classic music . And do you know there is a concert of classic music tomorrow evening ? __eou__ But I didn't get the ticket . And it is said that they were sold out yesterday . __eou__ I got two . We can go there together . __eou__ Amazing ! I can imagine the feeling when I hear the smooth tune around my ears . __eou__
How was your first date , David ? Are you satisfied with Jane ? __eou__ It was all right . She , tall and attractive , has stable job and source of income . __eou__ Yes , so I think she is suitable for you . __eou__ But , well ... what I want to say is ... __eou__ Stop acting like this . Say away ! __eou__ Her standard for selecting life partner is a little higher . I can not accept that . __eou__ What did she say ? __eou__ She said she want a man with large house , luxurious car and healthy parents . __eou__ Give her up . __eou__
Mark , you've been coming home late these days . What are you busy doing ? __eou__ Nothing important . I've been working overtime lately . __eou__ How many hours do you work each day now ? __eou__ 12 hours , including 5 hours overtime . __eou__ That's tough indeed ! Do you think your health can afford ? __eou__ I don't care . I need money . __eou__ Surely you'll be paid extra for overtime , but do you think it's really worth ? __eou__ Yes , I think so . When I work overtime I'm paid time and a half . __eou__ Oh , yes . Money comes faster in that way than otherwise . __eou__ But jobs with a lot of overtime are quite limited . Employers usually don't like to pay for overtime if they can manage . __eou__ That's true . __eou__
When do children start school in your country ? __eou__ Normally at six . Before that , they spend several years in the kindergarten or pre-school education center . __eou__ But thats only in the cities , isnt it ? __eou__ Right . In the countryside , things are more complicated . __eou__ Can kids in the countryside get equally good benefits and education like those in the cities ? __eou__ It depends . In some poor , underdeveloped areas , children's education is a problem . Many kids cannot afford to go to school . __eou__
Did you hear how cold it got last night ? __eou__ I heard the radio announcer say it was 18 degrees below zero . __eou__ It was so cold this morning . I could hardly start my car . __eou__ My car didn't want to start either at first . __eou__ Don't you have a garage ? __eou__ Not in the new apartment . We have to leave the car in the parking lot . __eou__ How much antifreeze did you put in your new car then ? You must have to keep it well below zero . __eou__ I do . Right now I have it protected up to 30 below zero . __eou__ Does it ever get that cold on here ? __eou__ Not really . It sometimes gets to 20 below . __eou__ Speaking of cold , how about going for a cup of coffee to warm up . __eou__
When was America discovered , Tony ? __eou__ I'm not certain . Do you know ? __eou__ America was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492 . __eou__ In a way that's right . But the Vikings travelled there long beforeColumbus . And what about the Red Indians ? __eou__ All right . Ask me a question now . __eou__ Who invented the electric light bulb ? __eou__ That's easy . It was invented by Edison . __eou__ Correct . Now for a harder question . Who will be the first men on Mars ? __eou__ I can't answer that . But I think Mars will be visited by men before theed of this century . __eou__ Ask me a question now . __eou__ All right . What is the nearest planet to the sun ? __eou__ That's easy . It's .. er . Venus . NO . Pluto . No . Wait a minute . It's Anthe tip of my tongue . Oh dear , what is the nearest planet to the sun ? __eou__

I had only three plates of ice cream.John had four . __eou__
Look at this fair . This is my first chance to be involved in the fair . It is so gorgeous and amazing ! __eou__ I felt dizzy when I stare at those shining lights .

Good number . __eou__ Lucky number . Find its location now . __eou__ We can also consult some from these volunteers . __eou__ Here it is . Well , remember to have our cards on to tell every visitor where we come from . __eou__ Should we put our samples on this table ? __eou__ Yes , they should be put in the most attractive place , and this can appeal to passers-by's attention . __eou__
Hi , Sven , can you help me ? Could you hold the end of the tape measure , please ? __eou__ Of course , where do you want me to stand ? __eou__ Just there by the door . I need to measure the length of this workbench . We're going to replace it . OK - 3 m 47 cm . Let's round it up to 3 m 50 . __eou__ I'm glad you're replacing it . We need more space to work on things . How deep will the new workbench be ? __eou__ Tell me what size you want and I'll order the wood . __eou__ Well , it's about 65 cm at the moment .

Hi , I'm calling about the ad in the paper . __eou__ Which ad would that be ? __eou__ For the job . __eou__ Good , which job is that ? We advertised several openings . __eou__ Oh ! It was for a market sale manager . Is that still available ? __eou__ Yes , it is . But we'll be making a decision on it pretty soon . Why don't you come in and fill out an application ? __eou__ What company is this for ? I mean where's the opening ? __eou__ We can discuss that when you come in and fill out the application . __eou__ Well , I'm already in this field and know most of the companies . Before I come in to fill out an application , I need to know who it's with so I know whether or not I'm willing to work with them . __eou__ I'm afraid I can't discuss that over the phone . __eou__ So you're a headhunter . __eou__ We're an Employment Agency . __eou__

I can see by your resume here that you studied business administration . __eou__ That's right . __eou__ So I wonder why you want to work for a newspaper . __eou__ I did reporting for the university newspaper in my school.And I always be very interested in journalism . __eou__ But journalism , it is a very different profession from administration.You know a lot about administration.Why don't you choose to work for a company looking for managers ? __eou__ I study the administration.Yes.But I'm more attracted to writing articles . I want to use my knowledge of business to write financial news . __eou__ A new reporter must expect to work many hours . __eou__ I know that starting reporters work many hours . I'm very willing to take on the challenge . __eou__
How can we develop a new brand image with no direction whatsoever ? __eou__ With the fifty forwards he sent out today , maybe we'll inadvertently get inspired . __eou__ I guess this is a good excuse to surf the Net on someone else's dime . __eou__ Who'd have thought Bean would be this kind of e-mail fanatic ? __eou__ He must have just got online for the first time last week . He still thinks it's some kind of new toy . __eou__
What are our areas for growth ? What sectors do you see the most potential in ? If we are going to pull our sales numbers up and develop the brand , we got to work across the board . __eou__ It's not just spreading out to new markets that we have to address . I think we'd better first pay attention to developing our brand in the markets we already have.We ' Ve reached the awareness level , but we haven't established customer loyalty . People know who we are , but they still don't trust in our brand . __eou__ I don't see why we can't work on opening new markets and developing the markets we've already penetrated at the same time ... Both aspects of developing our customer base and developing our brand are important . __eou__
Can you tell me , Ms . Smith , about the training programs you initiated this year ? __eou__ We ran a call center training service and language program to ensure that our customer service representatives are well trained . __eou__ What ’ s the result ? __eou__ We directly attribute an increase in our customer service feedback of 50 % to the increase in language skills and training that our employees have received . __eou__ That seems very impressive . Good work ! __eou__ Thank you , but I cannot take all the credit . Our employees have all worked very hard to increase their productivity level . __eou__
So Jen , what did you think of William ? Did you guys have a nice time on your first date ? __eou__ Oh yeah , it was great ! He took me to an Italian restaurant and we had an amazing conversation . I told him about how many kids I want , and how my parents will be so excited to meet him . __eou__ You said all that on the first date ? Alright ... Well are you two going out again ? __eou__ Yeah ! I called him after I got home to arrange our next date , but unfortunately his grandma is sick so he has been busy every night visiting her in the hospital . __eou__
We have to pick up Conrad before the party . __eou__ Alright , no problem . __eou__ We're supposed to meet him at Cal's Bar at 10 __eou__ Wait a minute . Cal's bar ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ That's a gay bar . __eou__ Yes , it is . Conrad is gay . Didn't you know ? __eou__ I thought he was maybe gay , but I wasn't sure.Anyhow , you don't expect me to go into a gay bar , do you ? __eou__ Why not ? We're supposed to meet him there . __eou__ Why doesn't he meet us outside ? __eou__ Why should he do that ? It isn't illegal for us to go in . __eou__ Yeah , but who wants to go in ? I'm not gay , you know . Why should I go in a gay bar ? __eou__ You sound like you're afraid . __eou__ I just wouldn't be comfortable . __eou__ You've never been in a gay bar before ? __eou__ No , never . __eou__ But it's just a bar . There's no danger.You shouldn't be so homophobic . __eou__ Well ... __eou__ Listen . If you refuse to go in , Conrad will be offended.You don't hate gay people , do you ? __eou__ No , I don't . But I never went into a gay bar before . __eou__ Don't worry about it . There is nothing strange about it.If Conrad's there , we'll leave for the party.If he's not , we'll sit down and have a drink . __eou__ Okay . I will try it . I suppose it isn't reasonable for me to refuse to go in.After all , gay people aren't afraid to go into normal bars . __eou__ I'm glad you feel that way.We ' ll leave in about ten minutes , alright ? __eou__ Fine . __eou__
I am kind of nervous . __eou__ Nervous ? Why ? __eou__ I don't know . I never went to a church before . I was not raised as a Christian , so I don't know what to do . __eou__ Don't worry . You don't have to do anything.All you have to do is listen . You will enjoy it . __eou__ Maybe . I know I agreed to go with you , but now I don't feel right about it . __eou__ Listen , Ryan.Catholics welcome people who aren't Catholics to visit the church.You don't have to pretend to be Catholic . It's okay if you just come to listen . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Yes . We are kind and welcoming people.It is not a secret society or something like that . __eou__ Alright . But will we sing ? __eou__ Yes , but you don't even have to sing . If you want to sing along , you can . __eou__ I don't know the words . __eou__ There is a songbook . All the words are in the songbook.Many people have to read the words . __eou__ And will I go up to the front to have the bread and wine ? __eou__ No . That is something only true Catholics do.So if you come to the church as a visitor , you only listen to the service.But you shouldn't go up to the altar for the bread and wine.Only after someone joins the church , then they go up for the Eucharist . __eou__ Eu-char-ist ? What is that ? __eou__ That is the special word for the ritual of the bread and wine.The Catholics call it the Eucharist . __eou__ It doesn't sound like an English word . __eou__ It's not . It's an ancient Greek word . It means gratitude . __eou__ Alright . Well , I feel more comfortable now.Now I understand I am welcome as a visitor . __eou__ Of course you are . I wouldn't ask you otherwise . __eou__
Hello , how are you today . Here for your six month check-up ? __eou__ I'm fine , Dr . Beecham . Yes , just a cleaning and check-up today . __eou__ Oh , fine . Let's take a look . __eou__ ( She probed my teeth and checked my gums . ) Well , it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose . We need to fill that cavity before it gets any worse and the crown needs to be refitted . Make an appointment for next week and I'll take care of them . __eou__ Okay , I'll do that , but my crown was just put on last year . Will my dental insurance cover the work ? __eou__ Since you had that done here , we'll take care of it . There won't be a charge . And , your insurance should cover the work on the cavity . Now , I'm going to have the hygienist do your cleaning and I'll see you soon for the other work . __eou__ Thanks , doctor . __eou__
Welcome to Credit Services . How can I help you ? __eou__ Hello . I'm here to talk about my credit card . You see , I'm a corporate card holder and a personal card holder . I've had my personal credit card for ages , but my corporate one is new to me . __eou__ Right . Well , the benefits are a little different . With our Corporate Card you can use it for agency collection and payment . __eou__ Is there anything else ? __eou__ There's quite a long list , actually ! You can use if for business trip expenses , medical expenses , any internal payments . __eou__ And I suppose I can do that anywhere ? I do have to travel a lot for my job and it's such a hassle using cash and collecting all the separate receipts . __eou__ If you put it on your card , you can get an overall statement that lists all of the transactions . __eou__ In just one document ? That will definitely be a time saver . __eou__
Welcome to Lincoln Bank . What can we do for you today ? __eou__ Hello . I called earlier in the week and spoke to someone in the personal loans department about an overseas study loan . She said to come in as soon as I had the chance , as this must be done in person . I'd like to apply today . __eou__ OK , that's absolutely fine . I will need to see some credentials before we can get started . Do you have the notification of admission letter from your university , your passport and your visa with you ? __eou__ Yes , yes .

You can choose , mortgage , pledge or guarantee mode . __eou__ Yes , I read about all of these in the brochure and decided which would be more suitable for me . I'd like to go for the guarantee mode , please . __eou__ Right , that's no problem . I see you are already well informed . If you choose that one , you can borrow up to 70 % of the total tuition and miscellaneous fees . __eou__ OK , that's perfect , 70 % is excellent , it'll be a big help . Thanks . __eou__
Hello , this is Lucie Jing calling from Lincoln Bank . May I speak to Mr Was , please ? __eou__ Speaking . __eou__ Ah , hello , Mr Was . I'm just calling about your new credit card .

Good afternoon . This is Michelle Li speaking , calling on behalf of IBA . Is Mr Meng available at all ? __eou__ This is Mr Meng speaking , Michelle . __eou__ Oh , hello ! Sorry about that . I'm just calling to say that we've received your new Corporate Credit Card from HQ . __eou__ That was quick ! I wasn't expecting it until later this week . __eou__ Yes , our application procedures have speeded up since we started using the new fast-track system . __eou__ Shall I come in and collect it ? __eou__ Or we can send it to you . But if you would like to use it at the ATM , you'll need to wait for your PIN number . __eou__ Mmmm ... if I come in and collect it this afternoon , is there any way I could use it today ? Petty cash is getting low , so I need to draw some money . __eou__ As long as you bring your ID , etc , we can serve you over the counter . But you won't be able to use the ATM until your new PIN number arrives . __eou__ I see . Yes , that's fine . I'll be there at around 2:30 pm . See you later , and thanks . __eou__
Who's that striking woman over there ? __eou__ Hm ? Oh , that's Alice . She's totally mad . Don't get yourself in a room alone with her . __eou__ Really ? Why not ? She looks great . __eou__ Yes , I know , but she's dangerous . __eou__ Really ? Tell me more . __eou__ Well , I'm not one to gossip , as you know , but rumor has it that she sued her former boss for sexual harassment . __eou__ Wow , crikey . So what happened ? __eou__ Well , this is just between ourselves , of course , but he was her lover and he wanted to leave her , so she got revenge . I heard him say she was a dangerous woman . __eou__ Wow . __eou__ Oh , while we're on the subject , what happened to you and your secretary ? __eou__ I have no idea what you're talking about . __eou__ Oh , come on . Everybody knows . __eou__ Could you excuse me a moment ? I have to make a phone call __eou__ Oh , sure . __eou__
Welcome , young man . No offence , but I haven't seen you here before . __eou__ Of course , this is my first time here . My Mom has a membership here . Here is the card . __eou__ Okay then . You are the younger customer here ever . __eou__ It's not so wise that you do not explore the children's market . __eou__ It's the marketing's fault , I suppose.What do you want to do ? __eou__ Well , I want to become just like Bruce Lee . What should I do ? __eou__ That's a long way to go , I'm afraid . First of all , you gotta grow up . __eou__ I am still young . And I'm growing every minute . __eou__ Sure . Then what about trying the treadmill or the skipping rope . __eou__ I love running . Anything else ? __eou__ Please change your clothes first ! __eou__ I'm perfect with my clothes . And I do not have anything else with me . __eou__ Sorry , but no jeans here . __eou__ Oh , that's the only place where jeans are not popular . I'd better just go home . __eou__
Excuse me . Do you speak English ? __eou__ Yes , I do . How can I help you ? __eou__ Well , I've just arrived in my room , but there are no instructions in English about the facilities available ! Could you help me for a moment ? __eou__ Of course not . What exactly would you like to know ? __eou__ First , what is the number for room service ? __eou__ It's 1200 . Room service is available 24 hours a day . __eou__ Very good . Now , could you help me to adjust the air conditioning , please ? It's too hot in my room . __eou__ Yes , the control unit is on the wall next to the bathroom . Is 24 ° C all right ? __eou__ Yes , that's perfect . Another thing , if need more items for the mini-bar , which Number should I call ? __eou__ You should call the Housekeeping Department on 2300 . They will replace any stock for you immediately . __eou__ I see . So , is it possible to make international phone calls from my room ? __eou__ That's no problem . Just dial 9 to get an outside line , and then dial the number as usual . __eou__ Well , thanks a lot for your help . __eou__ No problem , sir . If there's anything else you need , you can find me at the desk by the elevator , or you can call housekeeping if I'm not there . __eou__ OK , goodbye . __eou__ Goodbye , sir . __eou__

Could I ask you some questions ? __eou__ Yes , please . __eou__ Can you tell me the postal code for this building ? __eou__ Yes , it ’ s L8V 4B7 . __eou__ Thank you . Also , how can I get my mailbox key ? __eou__ I ’ ll tell Peter to bring your key to your apartment right away . __eou__ Who ’ s Peter ? __eou__ He ’ s the superintendent of this building . __eou__ Thanks a lot . I ’ Ve got one more question . __eou__ No problem . Go ahead , please . __eou__ Where can I change the address on my driver ’ s license ? __eou__ The Department of Motor Vehicles office is at 212 Barton Street North . __eou__ Can you give me directions to the office ? __eou__ We are at 2368 King Street East . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ So , it ’ s easy to get to the office from here . From your apartment , just drive along King Street East for about one kilometer and you ’ ll see a three-story blue building on your right . That ’ s the Department of Motor Vehicles building where you can change your driver ’ s license . __eou__ What floor is the office on ? __eou__ It ’ s on the first floor . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__ You are very welcome . __eou__
Hey John , did you register for classes yet ? __eou__ I register this Friday . __eou__ What classes do you plan on taking ? __eou__ I really want to take the communication class , but I don't know if it will be available . __eou__ Is that class really that popular ? __eou__ Yeah . I tried to get in last semester , but it was full by the time I registered . __eou__ What other classes are you going to take ? __eou__ I still need to take English 201 , but I really don't like writing . __eou__ I took that class already . There is a lot of writing , but it's not that bad . __eou__ Oh really ? Who was the instructor ? There are like 4 different instructors to choose from . __eou__ I had Professor Mahoney . __eou__ Is he an easy grader ? __eou__ I'm not sure if he is or not , but I thought he was definitely fair . __eou__ Do you mind if I ask you what you got ? __eou__ Not at all . I got a 3.8 . __eou__ Well , what did you get in English 101 last year ? __eou__ I got a 4.0 in that class . __eou__ Well , I can't compare to you . I got a 3.1 in English 101 . That means if you got a lower grade in English 201 , it must be harder . __eou__ It's not what it appears . I actually tried harder in the 101 class . If I put as much effort into the 201 class , I would have received the same grade . __eou__ Oh . That helps . Thanks . __eou__
Hey Mike . I forgot about registration . I'm a day late , so all the classes are mostly full . What do you think I should do ? __eou__ You're screwed . You can't do anything about that . You have to hope that you get some classes that will be useful . __eou__ Do you think going to the registration building will help at all ? __eou__ No . They will tell you the same thing in a worse way . __eou__ Did you register yet ? __eou__ Of course . Registering for classes is not something you want to miss . __eou__ What classes do you think are still open ? __eou__ Well , I know psychology 101 is a big class , so there will always be seats in that class . You can also get into Sociology . __eou__ That's helpful . Thanks . But what do you think about philosophy . I wanted to take that class this semester . __eou__ I took that class last year . The professor is really cool , so if you go to his office , you can have him sign a card that will let you in even if the class is full . __eou__ He does that ? __eou__ I guess that's because so many people drop out of that class . __eou__ That makes sense . I think I'll do that . Thanks for all the help . __eou__ No problem , man . __eou__
I find it really hard to express myself in class . I have lots of ideas , but they never seem to come out of my mouth . __eou__ let me give you a little advice . You know what the topics are going to be , so prepares what you would like to say in advance . __eou__ I often do , but I ’ m worried about the responses from other people . __eou__ you have to be realistic . Not everyone is going to agree with you , but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion . __eou__ I ’ m worried that what I say will not make sense . __eou__ we could chat about the topic before class . I could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking . __eou__ that ’ s a good idea . What should I do if I am in two minds about a topic ? __eou__ that ’ s easy . Express possibilities . People will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle . __eou__ I didn ’ t realize that speaking in class could be so easy . __eou__ the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say . They will reply to your statements , but you can ’ t be sure how . __eou__
Hello . May I help you ? __eou__ Yes , please . I've been here for nearly two months , but I still haven ’ t found a job . Do you think you can find one for me ? __eou__ Don ’ t worry , we ’ ll try to help you . Will you please fill out this form ? __eou__ What ’ s this form for ? __eou__ This is for registration . After you have given us your personal details , we'll match these against new jobs as they come in . And we ’ ll contact you when there is a job that suits you . __eou__ That's great . But how long do I have to wait ? __eou__ Maybe several weeks , maybe several months . It's hard to tell . __eou__ Oh , dear . How can I wait for such a long time ? __eou__ Actually , many jobs are filled by people who select vacancies from the display boards there . __eou__ Then , what do you think I should do ? __eou__ My advice is to keep looking for jobs yourself . Check the job boards at the job center regularly and check the newspapers daily . If you have friends or relatives here , ask them for help , too . __eou__ I see . Thank you very much for your advice . Bye . __eou__ Keep in touch . __eou__
Well , Mitzuko-san , I hope you like it here . This is my favourite restaurant in Taipei . It reminds me of my youth when I traveled around Europe . __eou__ It looks wonderful . Very authentic . __eou__ The chef trained in Florence . The pasta is very good here . __eou__ OK . So , what can you recommend ? __eou__ Hum ... You should try the mushroom fettucine . It's really good . __eou__ Is it salty ? __eou__ Not at all . It has a very delicate flavor . __eou__ What does ' Duppa del Giono ' mean ? I'm sorry I don't know how to pronounce that . __eou__ Oh , that means soup of the day . I'll ask the waiter what they have today . Have you tried mussels cooked the Italian way ? They're really delicious . __eou__ No . I'll try them . Sounds good . __eou__
This looks wonderful , Madame Culot . __eou__ Yes , it's very nice . All our foreign visitors enjoy it . The food is wonderfully well-prepared . Let me know if you need any help with the menu . __eou__ Thank you . Mmm . Can you tell me about the terrine ? __eou__ Yes . A terrine is a kind of meat pate . It's meat turned into a paste . It sounds horrible but it's actually really good . __eou__ Mmm . Maybe another time . __eou__ You could try the ravioli . They are rather like your Chinese dumplings , and the sauce is delicious . __eou__ Sounds good . I think I'll have the lamb for my main course . What does it come with ? __eou__ Well , you can have fries-French fries-or simple boiled potatoes . __eou__ I'll have the potatoes . What are you having ? __eou__ I'm having my usual . I like the fish here . Would you like some wine ? __eou__ Oh , yes . That would be lovely . __eou__
Can I have my check , please . __eou__ Here it is . 350 Yuan all together . __eou__ May son adores my new hairstyle so I suppose it is worth it . __eou__ Hearing you say that is a big reward for us . And here is the receipt . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Wait ! Congratulations ! You are the lucky customer of our anniversary celebration . __eou__ Wow , it's surprising . So what do I get ? __eou__ You can have a free facial and then make up free for you . Do you want it now ? __eou__ Probably not . Doing that will probably take another three hours which I can't afford now . __eou__ Here is our number . Call us when you are ready to come . __eou__ You mean I should make an appointment ahead of time ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Got it . Bye for now . __eou__
Mom ! __eou__ What are you doing ? __eou__ I'm playing with my new jump rope ! Watch this ! __eou__ You are sick , young lady . Get back in bed ! I called you in sick today , so you're going to lie down and fight that flu ! __eou__ But I feel better . __eou__ Then maybe you should go to school . If you're feeling so much better , you'll ace that English test , right ? __eou__ OK . I get it . I'm getting back into bed ... __eou__
Guess what , Gilly ? I won both bids . __eou__ Good for you . Did you use Paypal ? __eou__ Yeah . It was so easy and super-fast , once I figured it out . __eou__ That's the beauty of it , and the danger . __eou__ I should get the items within a week . But in the meantime I'm bidding on a digital video camera . __eou__ How much ? __eou__ Thirty U . S . dollars ... and it's only been used for six months . __eou__ Mmmm , sounds like risky business . Good luck . __eou__
I want a suit of workmanship and suitable for formal meetings.Would you recommend some brands ? __eou__ How about these famous brands ? Such as pierre Cardin ... __eou__ I'm afraid that's a bit beyond my means . __eou__ Then you can try some local products.They ' re also of good quality . __eou__
Hi , Doris . You look a little bit down . What's the matter ? __eou__ Well , I'm leaving Japan and I'm going back to London , tomorrow . __eou__ Really ! __eou__ Yeah . __eou__ How do you feel about that ? __eou__ Well , I do feel quite down because I am going to miss Japan after being here for 9 months , in Japan . I am going to miss it so much , cause I've had a great time here . __eou__ Mm , so what are you going to miss about Japan ? __eou__ Oh , I am going to miss the people , the food , the night life . Especially the nightlife . __eou__ What especially about the night life are you going to miss ? __eou__ Well , I really like dancing . And I enjoy going out to night clubs and to restaurants and eating Japanese food also and I'm really going to miss that because it's very different to London . __eou__ How are the clubs different in Japan than in London ? __eou__ Well , here there are many different clubs you can get into , for free , you don't have to pay , some of them . In London it's really expensive for drinks and an entry fee . __eou__
That is the most beautiful sunset ! __eou__ Let's stop the car and enjoy it for a minute . __eou__ Here is a good place . Let's get out . __eou__ Wow .

The sun is almost gone and yet there is still color everywhere ! __eou__ Where is our camera ? Let's see if we can catch this on film ! __eou__
Hello __eou__ Hi Angela , it's Dan . __eou__ Hi B . How are you ? __eou__ Good . __eou__ I called you yesterday . Did you get my message ? __eou__ Yes , I was taking a shower when you called . I saw that you called and I tried to call you back , but I think your phone was off . __eou__ No problem . I wanted to remind you that my friend is getting married next week . You're still coming to the wedding with me , right ? __eou__ Oh , is that next week ? __eou__ Yes . Did you forget ? __eou__ No , of course not . I already bought them a present . __eou__ That's good . I want to invite Megan also . Next time you see her , can you tell her for me . __eou__ Sure . Does she know your friend ? __eou__ Yes , I think they might have gone to the same college or something like that . I'm not exactly sure how they know each other . __eou__ Are we all going to drive together ? __eou__ Yes . I'll pick you up first , and then we'll go get Megan . __eou__
I used to be down on the sales people until I saw her in action . __eou__ She means business , for sure . __eou__ Most salespeople seem like half-brains . Zina's definitely an exception . __eou__ We'd better get back to work . __eou__ Yeah , I'm not too worried about Vince , but I'd hate to face Zina if we don't deliver ... __eou__
You look great ! __eou__ Thanks to you . I'm totally pumped up . __eou__ So you are happy that you made the decision to join us . __eou__ I surely am . But still there is one single problem . __eou__ What's that ? __eou__ I eat more and more these days . And it puts even more weight on me . __eou__ It's not good to start with too much work-out at the beginning . What about trying something else ? __eou__ I'd love to do that . What do you recommend ? __eou__ More and more people are warm up to Yoga these days . Do you want to have a try ? __eou__ Do you think it's a good option for health and relaxation ? __eou__ Absolutely . But it takes great perseverance to master . __eou__ I can so that . __eou__ Here is a free class going on right over there . Go and join them . __eou__ How did it go ? __eou__ Everything was okay when it started , but the music made me drowsy . So I think I may have dozed off for a minute over there . __eou__
Here's Copellini's , my cousin's store . __eou__ Sounds like an Italian name with an “ i ” at the end . __eou__ Admit it . You just think of Mussolini . __eou__ No , I'm an art lover , so I think more of Bellini and Botticelli ! __eou__ Ah , yes . The Italians do love the sensual forms of the human body . __eou__ Don't we all ... hey ! Your cousin sells gift items ? __eou__ Yeah-all from Italy . See all the saints ? They're important to Roman Catholics . __eou__
Where are we headed now ? __eou__ To a historic coffeehouse . It's got a little Mafia story to it . __eou__ Awesome . Was someone killed there ? __eou__ Oh , yeah , while he was eating , and he was a pretty famous Don . __eou__ Cool ! Is it safe for us to eat there though ? __eou__ Sure . In fact , nowadays , you'll see more tourists there than Italians . There are Mafia tours nowadays that go there to eat . __eou__

It ’ ll help me loosen up . __eou__ You bet . I used to take a whirlpool almost every night back home . __eou__

I've learned a lot from you . Thank you for all your kindness . __eou__ I'm glad you could come to see us off . I have enjoyed your interpreting . You have done a wonderful job . I hope you be my interpreter again next time I'm here . __eou__ I hope so , too . __eou__ It's hard to tear myself away from your friendly people and your ancient country , but nothing lasts for ever . I have to go back home this time , but I'm sure I'll return very soon . __eou__ I'm really glad to hear that __eou__ Good-bye . Miss Li , say hello to your husband and your son for me . See you soon . __eou__ Good-bye , Mr White . A happy journey home , and hope to see you again soon . __eou__
Where did you get assigned to go this time around ? __eou__ They asked me to go to Paris to check on the new office that was just established there . And you ? __eou__ Hong Kong again . I would like to go somewhere different for a change . __eou__ Teach me Cantonese and I'll pull some strings to get a trade with you next time around . __eou__ If you really want to learn , remind me when you get back from your business trip . __eou__ You're on . __eou__ When do you leave ? __eou__ I'm scheduled to fly out on the tenth . __eou__
Well , do you have any experience in guiding ? __eou__ Yes , but I only have few experiences . I guided a few groups of foreign tourists from America last winter vacation . I showed them around some places of interest . __eou__ What places of interest did you show them ? __eou__ Too many . I will just give you one example , Huangguoshu Falls , the largest waler-fall in China . __eou__
Now , what seems to be the trouble ? __eou__ It's nothing serious . But I always have a headache , and I haven't slept properly for several weeks . I've also lost appetite and my eyes are burning . __eou__ Mm , you do look rather pale . Let me take your temperature . Would you put the thermometer under your arm , please ? Now , let me listen to your pulse . Mm , do you feel weak ? __eou__ Yes , I never seem to have any energy . __eou__ I'll give you a blood test . Would you roll up your sleeve ? Just as I thought . You're anemic . You'd better pay more attention to your diet . Eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and food high in protein . And don't stay up late working . Try to get more rest . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
I can't believe that . __eou__ What ? __eou__ I've never heard Mary cursed anybody . But I heard she cursed another driver when she drove me back home today . __eou__ Oh . Why did she do that ? __eou__ The car behind ours suddenly accelerated and hit our Car . __eou__
What does a housing go for in south mountain district ? __eou__ It depends on the type of the house you're looking for . __eou__ We ’ re looking for a three-bedroom home . __eou__ What ’ s your general price range ? __eou__ Under 300,000 RIB , we suppose . __eou__ Umm , I think I would be hard to find something in that range in this area . You know the environment in the south mountain district is the nicest . __eou__ What about a two-bedroom house ? __eou__ A two-bedroom house in this area is generally around 250,000 RIB . __eou__ I see . __eou__ I recommend you buy a two-bedroom house . It is very suitable for a couple , and some two-bedroom houses are large enough for a one-child family . __eou__ Okay , I will take it into consideration . __eou__
Can you help me set up my voicemail message ? I just got this service and I am not really sure what I am supposed to say . __eou__ Sure ! You just basically gotta let the caller know who they called , and ask them for their contact information so you can call them back . __eou__ Ok , so can I say , " This is Abby's voicemail . I will call you later , so leave me your name and number " . __eou__ That's more or less the idea , but try something that sounds more friendly . __eou__ Ok , so how about this , " This is Abby and I am really happy you called ! I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can , so please leave me your name and number . Talk to you soon ! " . __eou__ A little too friendly Abby . Just say this , " Hi , you have reached Abby . I am unable to answer your call right now , but if you leave me your name and phone number , I will get back to you as soon as possible . Thanks " . __eou__ That's perfect ! Can you say that again and record it for me ? __eou__
Excuse me , can you help me figure out how to get to the Wudaokou subway station from here ? __eou__ Sure ... first you're going to have to buy a ticket to ride on the subway . The Wudaokou station is on the lightrail , so you'll have to transfer . Be sure you buy a combination ticket for the regular subway and the lightrail . It should cost you 5 yuan . __eou__ An after I buy the ticket , where should I go ? __eou__ You can take the red line train from here , but you'll have to transfer to the blue line at Fuxingmen transfer station . After you transfer , take the blue line that is heading north towards Fuchengmen . __eou__ So I transfer from red to blue , then how long do I ride the blue ? __eou__ You'll take the blue line until you reach Xizhimen . That's a big station , so there will likely be a lot of people getting off at that stop . You can transfer to the lightrail there , you'll have to exit the subway and present the unused portion of your combination ticket to the Ticketmaster , they'll give you a new ticket to use on the lightrail system . __eou__ It sounds so complicated ! __eou__ No , not the really , don't worry about it , like I said there'll be a lot of people there doing the same thing that you are doing , so just follow the crowd , There's only one direction to go , so you won't get on the wrong train . Head north on the Yellow line , and you'll see Wudaokou in just a couple of stops . __eou__
what a nice uniform ! __eou__ thanks ; do you like it ? __eou__ not really . I was being sarcastic . Does it come with the job ? __eou__ yes , everyone on the sales floor has to wear one . They're supposed to make us look more professional . __eou__ they're not actually that bad . They could be worse . What do you think about it ? __eou__ I don't mind it , actually . I don't have to worry about what I'm going to wear every day . __eou__ so are you enjoying your new job ? __eou__ it's much better than my old one . My new boss is great . __eou__ how do you like working in sales ? __eou__ I like the fact that I get to work with people . It makes the day go by much faster . __eou__ that's good .

Did you call me , sir ? __eou__ Yeah . If you are available now , let me describe your work duties , OK ? __eou__ What am I expected to do ? __eou__ As a newcomer , you are going to be responsible for some basic tasks first , including certain routine duties like answering the telephone and typing .

Before you do your job , it's necessary for you to be familiar with our own products . Sort these papers and file them correctly . __eou__ OK , I'll get to work on it at once . __eou__
Good morning . Madam . What can I do for you today ? __eou__ Hello . I hope you can help me ; I'm a little worried about my new card . __eou__ What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ I received my new card this morning , but I'm unable to use it . __eou__ Oh ? You mean , the ATM machine has eaten it ? __eou__ No , it's right here , see ? The ATM will not accept it ! __eou__ You said you received your card this morning , am I right ? __eou__ Yes . I was told it would be activated and ready to use right away . So , what's gone wrong ? __eou__ Did you receive your PIN number yet , Madam ? You see , unless you have your new PIN number , to match your new card , you cannot use it . We usually send that separately , around one day after the card , for security reasons . __eou__ Well , that explains it . I've been using my old PIN number ! Thanks for explaining everything to me . __eou__
Hello again . Have you come to a decision ? __eou__ I'm still not sure about these ' Visible ' Certificates . What's the real difference , except the amounts available ? __eou__ Visible Certificates are registered and the holders of these can report any loss directly to the bank . Also , they can be cashed in advance , before the maturity is up . __eou__ Right . How about the Bearer Certificates ? Can they be cashed before the maturity date ? __eou__ Unfortunately , not . You see , because they are not registered , they can be bought and sold by anyone . They also can be cashed on maturity in any nationwide financial institution . __eou__ So , if I was strapped for cash , I could transfer it to get some money ? __eou__ Technically , yes . __eou__ OK , I think I've got it . __eou__
What did the boss say ? __eou__ He asked me if I'd like to be a newspaper salesperson ? __eou__ You are still student so I don't think you should have time for that . __eou__ Don't worry about that . He said I can do that at spare time . Anyway , it's just a part-time job . __eou__ Okay , then . What kind of newspaper he wants you to sell ? __eou__ It's a weekly newspaper named Olympic English . So I need to be here only on Sunday . __eou__ Sounds interesting . Especially that we are Olympic Volunteers . __eou__ That's exactly what I am thinking about , And also it's a good way to get social experiences . __eou__ And a good way to get some pocket money . __eou__ Let's do it together . __eou__ I'll say yes . Wait a minute . I need an IC card . __eou__ For what ? You have a telephone at home , don't you ? __eou__ Yes , but I don't want my Mom to tap my phone when I call Clive . __eou__
Have we sold out all the newspapers for today ? __eou__ Yes . What a good job we have done ! __eou__ Why are so many extra gifts left here ? __eou__ Many customers didn't want them . __eou__ How about giving them to that old man ? __eou__ Good idea . __eou__ By the way , do you think it's a good idea to give free gifts to attract customers ? __eou__ I'm not sure , but still it did attract a large crowds today . __eou__ I think it should be more useful to hand out some fliers which is also cheaper . __eou__ But people can just throw them into the trash can as they turn around . __eou__ That's true . __eou__ Anyway , let's just finish out job and get back home . __eou__ Okay . How tiring the job is ! __eou__
Hey , what's new ? __eou__ Not much . Just sitting here eating some Chinese food . Is that the paper ? Why don't you open it and tell me my horoscope ? __eou__ Ok , wait a minute ... let's see . I'm a Taurus , and it says , Mars is in the third house , and is soon to eclipse Venus . I don't know what that means , but then it says , Your charm and drive will win others over to your way of thinking . Remember to be positive . Sounds good to me . __eou__ What about Gemini ? What's the prediction ? __eou__ Since Mercury has crossed paths with Jupiter , your fortunes are falling . Bad luck will follow you today , and you will lose that which you value . Be careful . __eou__ That sounds bad ! I'm really worried , what should I do ? Maybe I should go home and stay in the rest of the day . __eou__ But we have a date tonight ! You can't stay at home because of a stupid horoscope . __eou__
I've known from your resume that you are a college graduate . __eou__ Yes , madam . I graduated from Tianjin College of Finance and Trade three years ago . __eou__ What did you take as your major in college ? __eou__ I took Accounting as my major . __eou__ What kinds of work were you in charge of in the previous company ? __eou__ I was in charge of cost price and sales revenue . __eou__ All right , I see . Why do you want to work for a Sino-American joint venture enterprise now ? __eou__ There are two reasons for me to do it . First , I'm sure that there will be more opportunities for advancement If I enter your enterprise . Secondly , I'd like to acquaint myself with American culture if possible . __eou__ Well , Mr . Zhang , you must know , what we need is a capable accountant , and we won't have enough time to tell him some other things . __eou__ Yes , madam . I know that I'll be expected , first of all , to work hard if I'm hired . __eou__
You are looking really healthy lately . What are you doing differently ? __eou__ Thank you for noticing ! I've been making a few lifestyle changes over the past year . __eou__ Tell me about it . I'm interested . __eou__ Well , it all started when my brother challenged me to quit smoking . __eou__ Ha ! That's right . You used to smoke . I forgot ! __eou__ When I kicked that habit , I found I had so much more energy . I started exercising . __eou__ At the gym ? __eou__ No . I like to be outside . I took up hiking and mountain biking . __eou__
It's a beautiful day ! Let's play on those rides in the park . __eou__ Sounds like a good idea . I love to play on the jungle gym . __eou__ Me too . I love to play on the swing as well . Swing is my favorite . __eou__ That's great . Then we won't fight over taking the same ride . __eou__ Look at the flowers over there . What are they ? __eou__ They are morning glories . They are cute , aren't they ? __eou__ They are . We can find many different kinds of flowers and insects in the park . __eou__ I think so . Last time I saw dandelions and ladybugs near the pond . __eou__ If you come to the park in the morning , you can find squirrels running on the lawn . __eou__ It's really healthy to do some exercise there . The air is fresher and it's romantic to watch the sunset with your lover . __eou__ Well , off we go . I am sure we can have a great time . __eou__
Do you want to go catch a movie tonight ? __eou__ I can't , I have to go to the gym . __eou__ Come on ! You can go tomorrow , just skip it today . It's not as if you are gonna get in trouble ! __eou__ Actually I will ! I am working out with a personal trainer that gets on my case if I don't go . I like it , because it makes me feel more obligated to go and get healthy . __eou__ That's cool , does your personal trainer basically teach you how to work out ? __eou__ Yeah . He makes a work put plan depending on the areas I want to work on , or the muscles I want to build . Like for example in order to get better muscle tone in my abs , pecs and biceps , he makes me work out with free weights . Then for my quads , calves and hamstrings , I do leg lifts or squats . __eou__ Sounds like you are really getting in shape ! __eou__
Tom ? Oh , it's been a while since we've talked to each other . Nice to hear you again . __eou__ Same here . Hey , did you know Susan is going to get married . She invited me to her wedding and she wants you to attend also . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Definitely . I'm calling to tell you this . __eou__ Why didn't she call me ? __eou__ She tried , but the line is always busy . __eou__ Well , I may have stayed on the phone too long . Can you give me her number ? I'll call her later . __eou__ Of course . It's 555-4653 . __eou__ Thanks . So how are things with you ? __eou__ Pretty good . I've just bought a new house . __eou__ Wow ! Great ! Where ? __eou__ In the suburb . How are you and Carol ? Still living in town ? __eou__ Yeah , it's really convenient . The theater and Shopping Mall are within walking distance . Well , I got to go . I'll get in touch with you soon . __eou__ Okay . Don't forget to call Susan . __eou__ Don't worry . Bye . __eou__
Did you ever take History 231 ? __eou__ Yeah . Last semester . __eou__ Who was the professor ? __eou__ It was Professor Johnson . __eou__ I have him this semester . What do you think about him ? __eou__ He's a terrible instructor and demands a lot , but fortunately , he's an easy grader . __eou__ What did you end up getting ? __eou__ I got an A - . Sounds good , but none of my test scores were that high , so I don't know how I got a decent grade . __eou__ That's probably because he grades on a curve . __eou__ Are you enjoying the class so far ? __eou__ I hate it and I was about to withdrawal . But after hearing your experience , I think I will tough it out . __eou__ Yes . Definitely stay in the class . You will get a better grade than your test scores . He does that deliberately to make all the students study a lot . __eou__ Thanks for letting me know . I feel relieved now . __eou__
Hello , Tom , are you free next Sunday ? __eou__ I think so . Why did you ask that ? __eou__ I'm going to have my first baby , so I plan to hold a baby shower next Sunday . __eou__ Congratulations ! Why do people hold parties before the baby is born ? __eou__ It's the tradition . But baby showers as we know them today were not common until after World Warri . __eou__ In any case , I like baby showers , because they allow friends and family to share the joy and excitement of welcoming a new life into the world . __eou__ So you will come , won't you ? __eou__ Of course . I will prepare a good gift for the new arrival . __eou__ Thank you very much . __eou__
I usually bowl with an eight ball . I like the control of a light ball . I can spin it more , so that the ball hooks . __eou__ Well . I like them a little heavier . I don't have as much control , usually bowling straight , but the extra momentum compensates for that . __eou__ Well , let's see which technique is better . I think I'll go up first ... Yes ! I hit a strike . I knocked them all down on my first bowl . __eou__ Well done . You got them all . You get 10 points and your next two bowls are added to this frame's score . I'II dry my ball off and try to knock them all down as well . __eou__ Good start . You knocked eight pins down . But you are left with a 7,10 split . Unless you can bowl a UFO-ball on this bowl , it is going to be impossible . __eou__ I certainly can try ... No ! It went straight through the wickets . __eou__
Excuse me , I'd like to ask you a few questions about the city . __eou__ OK , please . __eou__ My wife wants to take the children to go shopping , where is the best place to go ? __eou__ I would recommend the mall , it's about 20 minutes , drive to the south in a taxi . It has a wide range of shops and restaurants . __eou__ Thank you . Also , we'd like to do some sightseeing while we're in town . Can you recommend some local attractions ? __eou__ How old are your children ? __eou__ I have a 10 - year-old boy and a 6 - year-old girl . __eou__ I would recommend a day at the zoo . It's fun for all the family . There is also a water park just outside the city if you would like a day trip . __eou__ It sounds marvelous . Thank you for your help . __eou__
Hello , let me introduce myself . I'm your neighbor . My name is Shirley . __eou__ Hi , Shirley . I'm Sophie . It's nice to meet you . __eou__ Nice to meet you , too . __eou__ Please come in . __eou__ Here is a little gift for your family . It's a calendar with all the community events on it . I hope it can be helpful . __eou__ I really appreciate it . __eou__ Since we are neighbors , if you need any help or anything , please come to me . __eou__ I will . Actually , I am worried so much about the security of this community because my house has been burgled twice before . __eou__ Oh , don't worry about that here . There are security guards on duty 24 hours a day and they patrol all over the neighborhood . You know , they are all very strong . __eou__ Really ? That's good . Is there any supermarket in our neighborhood ? __eou__ Of course . There is a Carrefour near the neighborhood . I'll show you there if you want to . __eou__ That's terrific ! __eou__ By the way , a party will be held for new neighbors the day after tomorrow . I hope I can see you there . __eou__ Yeah , and we can get to know each other at the party . __eou__
It's almost midnight ! We are about to start a brand new year ! __eou__ I know it's so exciting ! A new year is always like a clean slate . Fresh start to accomplish any dreams , objectives and goals . __eou__ Do you have a New Year's resolution ? __eou__ I was thinking about it , but I'm never able to keep my New Year's resolution . Last year for example I joined a gym and only went twice . __eou__ Yeah I know what you mean . That's why this year I am keeping things more simple . Maybe like getting together with friends I haven't seen in a long time , or doing some volunteering work . __eou__ That seems reasonable . We should get together and watch the ball drop in Times Square . __eou__ Sure , as long as you don't try to kiss me at midnight ! __eou__ Well , we can't break tradition ! It's bad luck ! __eou__
Well , that's it . 7 appointments in Paris at beginning of next week , and 4 in Frankfurt at the end of the week . __eou__ It's certainly a tight schedule . __eou__ Now it's a question of getting there . I need a flight to Paris on Sunday evening and a hotel in Paris for 3 nights . I have to be in Frankfurt by 11 on Thursday morning . And I will need a hotel for one night . I will head home on Friday . __eou__ At what time ? __eou__ My last appointment is at 3 , so I should be free by 5 at the very latest . I think I could get to the airport by 6 . __eou__ Do you know how far you will be from the airport at 5 ? __eou__ No , not really . __eou__ So you are not sure how long it will take to get there ? __eou__ No , but I am sure it won't take more than an hour . __eou__ Don't forget it's Friday nighty . If Frankfurt's anything like London , everybody will be leaving for the weekend . It will be a rush hour and traffic might be moving very slowly . __eou__ You are a pessimist . __eou__ I am a realist . __eou__
What seems to be the problem ? __eou__ My stomach hurts , Doctor . __eou__ Has this been a problem before ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ For how long ? __eou__ I have had it on and off for the past three years . It's just gotten much worse these past two weeks . __eou__ Do you only feel this way when you stomach is empty ? __eou__ After I've eaten , it goes away for a while . __eou__ Do you feel nauseous ? __eou__ Yes , occasionally . __eou__ Do you have regular bowel movements ? __eou__ I think so . __eou__ Let me take a look at your abdomen . Lie down on your back and bend your knees up . OK . relax ... Alright , it seems like you have a duodenal ulcer , but we'll have to run some tests before I can be certain . You should get a good rest first and try not to strain your stomach too much . __eou__ Is it serious ? __eou__ Not too serious , but it'll take you some time to recover , so you'll need to be patient . __eou__
Excuse me , I want to know the price of your CPU . __eou__ Glad to tell you . The price of CPU is 300 dollars . __eou__ It's rather too high . If you can make it cheaper , we will be able to place large orders continuously . __eou__ If you order a large amount , we can give you a discount . __eou__ Well , can you explain it to me ? __eou__ The price of CPU is 260 dollars above 1,000 Units . __eou__ Can you reduce more ? __eou__ I'm sorry , but to be frank , considering exploiting the market in your country , we have already supplied you at very low preferential price . __eou__ In that case , we have to stop ordering if a reduction can't be made . Please reconsider . __eou__ It is so hard to deal with . __eou__ If you can give us a more reduction , We'd be able to give you an order on the spot . __eou__ This price is the best we can make . __eou__
Mr . Black ? I'm from the Pacific Mechanical Company . __eou__ Oh , yes . Step inside , will you ? I'll give you an idea of what business I want to take up with you . Take a seat . We can go into details later . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Our speciality back in South Africa is wholesale supplying of screws , bolts , nuts , pins , studs , and that kind of things . __eou__ For wood or for metal ? __eou__ For both . Now , do you make machines for producing such things ? __eou__ Yes , we have a showroom not far away from here , Mr . Black . Are you free now ? __eou__ Yes , quite free until noon . __eou__ Fine . Then , shall we go right away ? I have a car outside . __eou__ Have you ? That's splendid . Just let me get my things together . I won't keep you long . __eou__ Take your time , sir . I can wait . __eou__
What sort of problems do you have with these machines ? __eou__ They're quite complex machines and they have a lot of different components . We need to check the metal casing regularly for any signs of corrosion . We also check the brushes once a fortnight to make sure they aren't worn down . It's important to make sure everything is properly aligned and we adjust it if necessary . There is a canvas belt at the end of the assembly line . If it gets wet , it might rot so we check that regularly too . __eou__
How is your English ability ? __eou__ Not bad . I ’ m proficient in both written and spoken English . __eou__ Could you tell me something about your English education ? __eou__ I studied English in junior and senior high school . And in college , I took English conversation lessons . They were given by foreign tutors . __eou__ Have you passed College English Test Band 4 or Band 6 ? __eou__ Band 6 . __eou__ Great . Can you file in English ? __eou__ I ’ m afraid I can ’ t , but I'd be glad to learn . __eou__ You would be using a lot of English in this job . Can you manage English conversation ? __eou__ Yes , I think I can . I often talk to foreigners at English corner held twice a week at my college . They say my English is pretty good . __eou__ Excellent . How is your English ability in reading and writing ? __eou__ I have been attending an evening course in English writing for 2 years and I often read novels , magazines and newspapers in English . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__

Let's go ahead ! __eou__

How much did you change ? __eou__ I wanted to change around 5000 dollars . And you know the exchange rate . __eou__ Yes , it's about 35 pesos for every Taiwan dollar , right ? __eou__ Not today . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ I went into the bank with my money , and I looked at the exchange board.At first I couldn't believe it . I thought I was reading the board wrong or something . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Because the board said 60 pesos for every Taiwan dollar . __eou__ Sixty ? That's too much . How can that be ? __eou__ I thought it was wrong too . It didn't make sense . __eou__ Just two days ago it was 35 . How can it be 60 ? __eou__ So , I went up to the teller and started to exchange the money . And it's true.They really gave me sixty pesos for the dollar . __eou__ That's amazing ! Really ?

Let's see ... they have red wine , white wine and port . They even have sangria ! It's the happy hour special . __eou__ Port's too sweet . It's a dessert wine . A dry red French wine would be nice with meat . A glass of chilled white German wine would be good with fish . But , we're not eating and it's hot out , so I think I'll have a tall glass of sangria with ice . __eou__ Good choice ! But , what's your favorite kind of hard liquor ? __eou__ I like to stick to the clean stuff , like vodka , gin , white rum and other clear spirits . __eou__

What about our stereos ? It looks like we both brought our stereos . Probably we only have room for one . __eou__ Your stereo is better than mine . Do you mind if we use yours ? __eou__ No , I don't mind . I just don't know where we can put the speakers in this tiny room . __eou__ Probably we can put one on that counter . And we can put one on the floor by the bed . Over there . __eou__ Alright . That's a good plan . What about the desks ? We have two desks , one by the window and one by the door ? Which one do you want ? __eou__ Well , the desk by the window is nicer , of course . Don't you think ? __eou__ Yes , I agree . __eou__ So since I got the bottom bunk , why don't you get the desk by the window ? That would be more fair . __eou__ Alright . __eou__ I mean , we could flip a coin for it , but I would probably win again . I'm incredibly lucky you know . Especially with girls . __eou__ Is that right ? __eou__ Yes , that's right . __eou__ Well , I hope you let me hang out with you then . Maybe I can learn from you . __eou__ Oh , certainly . Certainly . I'm always willing to help beginners.Just call me Big Brother Dave . __eou__ Are all lucky people so stuck up ? __eou__ C'mon , don't take it seriously !

I'll wait for you to get on the green before I putt . __eou__ No . you go ahead and putt it out . Then I'Il go . __eou__ No way , Mary . I'm going to let you go first .

You should be on the watch out . __eou__ I have no reason to distrust him . He's never caused any harm . __eou__ Isn't there anything that sounds fishy ? __eou__ Nothing smells a rat .

Did you check the internet for next week's weather forecast ? __eou__ I sure did . You're in luck ! It's supposed to snow all week in the mountains ! __eou__ Yes ! Somebody up there loves me ! I knew it wasn't too late for snow . __eou__ It is kind of strange though , to have snow in April , and so much of it . __eou__ There have been so many dry winters lately that it's about time , don't you think ? __eou__ When you put it that way , I guess the skies can't hold out on us forever . __eou__ This will be the best ski trip I've ever taken .

What else can we do ? You can ’ t stay in the heat for long . __eou__
Do you know anyone who ’ s had plastic surgery ? __eou__ You mean like a breast enlargement ? I don't think that's really necessary . That's not the way a woman should stay attractive . __eou__ Why not ? Why can't we go back to the way things were ? __eou__ Because ... I don't know . But , Connie , you wouldn't do that , would you ? __eou__ Darned right I would ! __eou__ Maybe make-up would be enough ? __eou__ Come on , Liz . Be open-minded ! Look at my eyes , they are puffy . And my eye bags , they are dark and loose and full of lines and circles .

Well , we've settled everything in connection with this transaction except the question of the mode of payment . __eou__ Because this order is a comparatively big one , we would like to pay by time L / C , say , 60 days L / C . __eou__ Payment by sight L / C is quite usual in international trade , and as a rule , we only accept payment by sight L / C . __eou__ But we have only moderate mean at hand . If you can do us a special favor this time and allow us to delay payment , we'd really appreciate it . __eou__ Accepting time L / C is unusual and I've never done it before , but we could consider your request . I'll phone our company to see what they say . __eou__ Thank you for your consideration . When will you let me know your answer ? __eou__ This afternoon . __eou__
We've got very good workshop facilities here . We do all our own servicing and most repairs .

If we don't have the facilities to deal with it here , we send it out for maintenance . __eou__ Is that more expensive ? __eou__ It depends on the job . It's actually more cost-effective than buying specialist equipment that we don't use very often . __eou__
I heard Nick found a job in a bank and his salary is said very high . I also want to work there . __eou__ Will this do ? Your major is not related to banking , as you know . __eou__ I know that , but making a lot of money makes me crazy . __eou__ Money is not the only standard to decide your career .

But I'm not sure Federal Express picks up mail in this city . If that's the case , I'll send the package through Chinese express mail service . __eou__ OK . __eou__
I plan to add an introductory letter behind the resume to increase the probabilities of success in the interview . __eou__ That's a good idea . Do you know how to write an introductory letter ? __eou__ I'm not sure of that . Do you know ? __eou__ I just know a little . First you need to include your basic information , such as your name , age , gender and major , etc . __eou__ Yes , I think so , too . I must introduce myself in truth . __eou__ I think the most important is that you need to show the employer that you are qualified for that job . __eou__ So I should write my strengths in the introductory letter , especially those related to the work . __eou__ Yes , thus the employer can know you very well , and then decide whether you are the right person . __eou__ You are very nice to tell me those . __eou__ I wish you good luck ! __eou__ Thank you ! __eou__
What do you think about half day kindergarten for Stacey ? __eou__ We could try it for the first few weeks and see if she likes it . __eou__ I just think it will be a little difficult for her to be away from home for so long right off the bat . __eou__ You have a good point .

Not my Dad , I hope ! ? __eou__ Come on , Mary , it's your brother , Jack . __eou__ No kidding ! Jack is such a log ! He's never dated a girl . __eou__ The problem with Joe is that she's too shy to tell him . __eou__ And the problem with Jack is that he seems to have no interest in girls . He's putting his heart into his stamp collection . __eou__ Well , if you want to help your friend , you should do something about it . __eou__

Home at last . Tonight we have a lot of homework though . __eou__ Are you saying we don ’ t have time to watch our favorite show tonight ? Jane , you know I really don ’ t like our teacher all that much . He gives far too much homework .

Just think about all the drinks . __eou__ No . If it's your birthday , then you don't need to pay a cent . Just blow out the candles and open the gifts . That makes the birthday a special day . Your friends will take care of everything . __eou__ Wow . That's wonderful . __eou__ What about in China ? What'd you do to celebrate your birthday ? __eou__ Nowadays , it's no difference from America . But in old times , we have traditional ways to celebrate it . __eou__
Mr . Smith , I would like to get right to the point here . First , we need to talk about how much each company will pay . __eou__ Well , we want to have the largest share . Our company is much larger than yours , and we have been in business longer . __eou__ Let's look at that another way . The major point is the value that we add , not who has been in business longer , or is bigger . __eou__ What are you thinking about ? __eou__ We do not want to place ourselves in an inferior position . We are a good , small company---that's why you are interested . __eou__ Then , what would make you feel more comfortable ? __eou__ If you take a 75 % position in the venture , we would take a back seat to you . __eou__
how was your day ? __eou__ let ’ s start with you . How was yours ? __eou__ it was really busy . I had to work straight through my lunch break . __eou__ did you get to leave early then ? __eou__ my boss told me that I could either go home early or take a long lunch break another day , so I decided to wait and take a long lunch break another time . __eou__ it was nice of your boss to give you an option . My boss would never do that . __eou__ let ’ s get back to you . How was your day ? __eou__ it was horrible ! It was just one thing after another . __eou__ you look pretty upset . Are you ok ? __eou__ I ’ m fine . But I have bad news . __eou__ what ’ s that ? __eou__ I got sacked today . __eou__ you ’ re kidding ! How did that happen ? __eou__ well , I was late to work today . It was the third time I was late this week . __eou__ how late were you ? __eou__ only about 5 minutes . __eou__ you got fired for being a few minutes late ? __eou__ my boss is really picky about that . He never arrives late , usually works over-time , and always gets his work done on time . __eou__ oh well . You never really liked your boss anyway , did you ? __eou__
I feel like to wear my hair in this way . __eou__ Oh , it's really popular these days . __eou__ Do you think it's suitable for me ? __eou__ Honestly speaking , I think the one next to it suits you better . __eou__ Even though I really like it , it's just too modern for me . __eou__ That's not true . Look over there ! That lady chose the same one and she is surely older than you . __eou__ Okay then . And I also want to have my hair colored . __eou__ Which color do you like ? __eou__ Claret-red . __eou__ Nice choice . __eou__ How long will it take ? I hope it won't be too long . __eou__ I hope not but it will take at least three hours . __eou__ Now it's my son's turn to wait . __eou__
Martha . What's wrong ? Why are you crying ? __eou__ Jake just broke up with me . __eou__ I'm sorry . When did this happen ? __eou__ Yesterday . I didn't even know it was coming . He just told me he found someone else . __eou__ What a jerk . He doesn't deserve you . __eou__ But it still hurts . I thought I loved him . __eou__ He didn't treat you that well either . Maybe you don't want to hear this , but I think you can do better . __eou__ Better or worse , it doesn't matter . I had a lot of feelings for him . I really liked him __eou__ It must be really painful . I remember when Josh and I broke up . I was crying for a week . __eou__ I know . I'll get over him . My first break up was painful because I was naive . __eou__ Exactly . You'll find someone again . You should get your mind off of this . Let's go shopping . __eou__ Maybe tomorrow . I don't feel like it tonight . __eou__ How about coffee down the street ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__
Tomorrow is Halloween , I know I'm ready . I bought two pumpkins and a big bags of candy . Do you want to help me a jack-o-lantern ? __eou__ I'd love to . I heard about Halloween when I was in Beijing . It's kind of a children's day . Small kids get dressed up , then walk around with paper bags or baskets , knocking on the neighbor's __eou__ They are supposed to say trick or treat ? Then the neighbors are supposed to hand up the candy . __eou__ That's kind of cool . But what's the trick mean ? __eou__ Usually it's the older kids going around playing Halloween , like punching the pumpkins left outside people's doors or - - someone's tree . They usually do it late at night after little kids go __eou__ That sounds kind of fun , maybe I can get tighter with my friends that night . __eou__ Usually be adults , you don't have kids have a big party in get dressed up too . __eou__ That does sound a lot of fun . __eou__

But now you are putting on some weight . __eou__ I have to admit it's easier said than done . __eou__ Well , I think it's time for you to change your eating habits and develop a healthy lifestyle . Regular exercise will improve your health . __eou__ But you know I'm just not into exercises . And I wouldn't have time for exercises , either . __eou__ You can do some jogging . It's easy and it doesn't take much time . __eou__ Actually , my doctor said the same thing . __eou__

The sun was lovely , too . __eou__ I will . How would you like your hair today ? The same style as usual ? __eou__ I have a special party tonight , and I'd like to change my style .

Did you know that the senior class president works for the class for life ? The job doesn't stop when we graduate . __eou__ Really ? What is there to do after we graduate ? __eou__ Every class reunion is organized by the president and council and anything our class does for the school in later years is headed by the president . __eou__ I'm honored that you think I would be qualified . But I would really have to think about this first . __eou__

Why do you keep running out of money ? __eou__ I guess I don't earn enough . __eou__ No , I think it's how you budget your life , that's the problem . __eou__ That's my business , not yours . __eou__ True enough , until the time comes that you need to take my money . I don't know where you're wasting your money but I think you need to take a look at what's really important . __eou__ So how do you survive from pay day to pay day ? __eou__ I don't just survive . I put money away as well . I know when I get paid where most of the cash will go , and I stick to my plan . If I follow a budget I don't have any nasty surprises . __eou__ I'm not disciplined enough I guess . __eou__ In a few months I'm planning to invest my money into some foreign companies .

Come on , you are left behind ! __eou__ Wow , I can't catch my breath . You are running too fast , honey . __eou__ You just need more exercise . __eou__ Yes , but you need to slow down . This is jogging , not racing ! __eou__ I don't care . I want to burn up my fat . __eou__ But running so fast is not good for people over forties . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ We are not as athletic as we were when young . Mild exercise is more suitable for us . __eou__ But I want to burn up more calories ! __eou__ In fact , in order to burn up your fat , you must take it slowly for a longer time . __eou__ Really ? I will slow down then . __eou__

I saw the score on your report . __eou__ Hey , I worked hard on that report and I deserve the grade I got . __eou__ It just happened to be the highest grade in the class . __eou__ You're just jealous because you didn't do as well as you thought you did .

David , what do you want to do after graduation ? __eou__ I suppose I should choose one from the ' Best Career List ' , to be a public officer , what do you think ? __eou__ That sounds like a hot job , right ?

We will have to confiscate these . __eou__ Confiscate ? __eou__ Yes , we will have to dispose of them . __eou__ It's too bad . They are very delicious . __eou__ I know . One out of every three travelers from Taiwan seems to be carrying them.They are being smuggled in by the thousands . __eou__ Oh , well . Not by me . __eou__ No , not today at least . Enjoy your visit to the United States , Mr . Lee . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__
Hi , Mary , I have decided to look for a job as a salesman . __eou__ Good ! Have you got the recruitment information on marketing ? __eou__ Yes . I have found some through different channels . __eou__ Really ? That's great ! Tell me . __eou__ OK . The first piece of job information I got was from the Internet , and it is about selling medicines . __eou__ What do you think of this job ? __eou__ I am not familiar with the medicine industry , and I don't think it fits me well . __eou__ Then how about the others ? __eou__ Another is about electronic commerce , and its products are mainly large machinery equipments . __eou__ I have heard about electronic commerce , and many people say it has good prospects for development . __eou__ I also feel it's nice . I want to give it a try . __eou__ Come on ! I believe you will succeed . __eou__ Thanks . You can also seek job information on the Internet . __eou__ Good idea . I will think it over . __eou__
It's Mrs Bardot , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it is . But I'm afraid we haven't met before . __eou__ I'm Greg Wu , Head of Consultancy . I see that you'd like a credit check done for your company . Is that right ? __eou__ Hello Greg . Yes , that's correct . You see , we have just acquired a new partner , the transaction is huge . It's to be signed next month , and we would really like to have some clearer information about them . __eou__ I see . So , it's not for your company , it's for the prospective partner ? __eou__ That's right . I feel it's always better to go in with both eyes open , if you know what I mean . __eou__ I couldn't agree more . If you have the company details with you I can get on with that right away . Is there anything else that you need from us today ? __eou__ The lady at the desk , Shelly I think , told me you offer many other consultancy services . __eou__ We do indeed . Such as making trade investments , financial consultancy , and of course the service you requested . __eou__ That's good to know . Thanks for your help today , I'll leave you with the details and you can get started . __eou__
Good afternoon , Lincoln Corporate Services . Lina speaking , how may I help ? __eou__ Hello , Lina . I'm calling about your new PIN scheme . I'm new to all of this , so some of my questions may sound a little ignorant ... __eou__ That's not a problem , I'm more than happy to explain everything in laymen's terms . PIN stands for Personal Internet Banking . You can do all of your usual banking using the Internet , no need to call __eou__ I see . How about buying and selling items ? __eou__ We can take care of that for you , too . You can get all of your usual banking services plus some new extra ones . As this service is net bases , you can do it anywhere . __eou__ That's good to know , because I do travel quite frequently . __eou__
Hello , Sir . What can we do for you today ? __eou__ Hello . I've been asked to come and see about something called L / C ? What is it exactly ? __eou__ L / C stands for ' letter of credit ' . This is necessary for trade between two countries . A Letter of Credit is quite literally that — a letter addressed by the buyer's bank to the seller's bank stating that they could vouch for their good customer , the buyer , and that they would pay the seller in case of the buyer's default . Nowadays , it's sometimes used for domestic trade too . __eou__ So the other party could be across the world or just on the other side of the street ! __eou__
can you help me pick out some fabric for a suit ? I'm going to get one made for a friend's wedding . __eou__ sure . What kind of material do you want for the suit to be made from ? __eou__ it depends on the price , but I was thinking of getting a wool / cashmere blend . __eou__ that will probably be quite expensive , but the more you pay for the fabric , the longer it'll last and the better it'll look . What color do you want the suit to be ? __eou__ I was thinking of a brown pin-striped suit . __eou__ brown , huh ? Isn't that a bit dull ? __eou__ haven't you heard ? Brown is the new black . __eou__ why don't you just get black ? Black suits are always fashionable and can be worn for anything — a funeral , a wedding , a job interview — anything ! __eou__ that may be true , but black is so boring . Anyway , I already have three black suits . I might as well get a suit that stands out from the rest . __eou__ here are two different shades of brown . Which one do you prefer ? __eou__ I like the one on the left , but I don't like the pattern on it . It's too much . I want a pattern that's a bit subtler . __eou__ how about this one ? __eou__ I think that will do . Let's go talk to the tailor about getting it made . __eou__ ok , let's go . __eou__
What a beautiful watch . It goes very well with your ring . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ Is that your wedding ring ? __eou__ I'm not married yet . It's my engagement ring . __eou__ Well , congratulations . When is the big date ? __eou__ In June . __eou__ Did you have the watch before getting the ring ? __eou__ Actually , we bought the ring together after I got the watch . __eou__ You did a fabulous job with the selection . It's gorgeous . __eou__ Thank you so much . __eou__ What kind of watch is it ? __eou__ It's a Tag Heer . __eou__ If you don't mind me asking , how much do they cost ? __eou__ This one is $ 1500 . But they range from $ 600 to $ 3000 . __eou__ That's why it looks so nice . I should have figured . You always get what you pay for . __eou__ Yeah . I would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones . __eou__
Good afternoon , you look a little stuck . Can I help ? __eou__ The thing is , I've got all of this information here , all of these leaflets , but I can't make head nor tail of them ! __eou__ I see . What is it exactly that you are interested in ? __eou__ I'm not sure which would be better for me ; buying some insurance or putting my money in a Savings Deposit . __eou__ Well , that all depends on how much you want to invest . __eou__ I was thinking of around 10,000 RIB . __eou__ That's a nice round figure to deal with ! OK , if you were to buy this insurance policy , your yearly fixed income from it would be 94.35 RIB . __eou__ And for the Savings Deposit ? __eou__ For the Savings Deposit you could actually get more . You see , in time deposit , the interest rate is 1.58 % after the 20 % interest tax . So , technically you could get more than a third more . __eou__ Wow ! A third more ? Very good . __eou__
Hi , I'm home ! Can you double that recipe ? I ran into an old friend after work and invited him for dinner . __eou__ No problem . Who is it ? Anyone I know ? __eou__ I don't think so . Do you remember Bob Gain from Tulsa ? __eou__ That name doesn't ring a bell . But tell me more . __eou__ He was on the diving team with me in high school and saved my life one day . __eou__ Well , I'll have to personally thank him by making him my famous chocolate cake . __eou__ You're glad he saved me , huh ? __eou__ Absolutely ! Bob and his whole family are welcome here any time ! __eou__
It's very nice of you to invite me . __eou__ I'm very glad you could come , Mr . Liu . Will you take a seat at the head of the table ? It's an informal dinner , please don't stand on ceremony ... Mr . Liu , would you like to have some chicken ? __eou__ Thank you . This is my first time to come to a Chinese restaurant . Could you tell me the different features of Chinese food ? __eou__ Generally speaking , Cantonese food is a bit light ; Shanghai food is rather oily ; and Hunan dishes are very spicy , having a strong and hot taste . __eou__ Chinese dishes are exquisitely prepared , delicious , and very palatable . They are very good in colour , flavour , and taste . __eou__ Mr . Liu , would you care for another helping ? __eou__ No more , thank you . I'm quite full . __eou__ Did you enjoy the meal ? __eou__ It's the most delicious dinner I've had for a long time . It's such a rich dinner . __eou__ I'm so glad you like it . __eou__ Thank you very much for your hospitality . __eou__
I ’ d like to be fitted for a suit please . __eou__ Certainly . Have you decided which material you would like the suit to be made from ? We have a selection of materials over here . __eou__ Well , I thought that I would choose either this one or that one . I really want a dark blue suit . Which do you recommend . __eou__ This material is a little more expensive , but is of much higher quality . __eou__ Yes . I can feel the difference in material . There ’ s not much difference in price . Ok , I ’ ll take the more expensive one . __eou__ Fine . I ’ ll measure you for the suit ... shoulder ... waist ... inside leg ... forearm ... upper arm ... thank you . I ’ ll prepare the suit for you tomorrow . Could you come again the day after tomorrow just to check that the su __eou__ That ’ s fine . I would also like a few shirts and a jacket . I don ’ t need them specially made . Those shirts over there look very nice . Are they made of cotton ? __eou__ Yes , they are . How many would you like and of which color ? __eou__ I ’ ll take three light blue ones , please . __eou__ Are you looking for a casual jacket or something formal ? __eou__ Just a casual one - a sport jacket . This one looks nice . I ’ ll just try it on ... yes , that ’ s fine . I ’ ll take it . Here ’ s my credit card . __eou__ Thank you very much , sir . I ’ ll put the shirts and jacket into a bag for you . __eou__ Thank you very much . I ’ ll see you the day after tomorrow . __eou__
So , how's your work ? __eou__ Good . How about you ? __eou__ I am going to resign . A few of the new staff have already left . Obviously , a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries . __eou__ But your company is huge . Can't they afford to pay the staff decent wages . __eou__ But we have a policy of paying according to seniority in the company , so new employees get quite low salary , no matter how excellent they have done . __eou__ That's shortsighted . By the time the workers are experienced and contributing . They are likely to go . __eou__ That's why I am going to leave . __eou__ But you have already worked there for five years . __eou__ I am worried about my future . I can't believe that our company is as big as it is . The company can only continue to grow by taking care of its staff . __eou__ Well . The management doesn't seem to think that way . Anyways , you have to think twice before you act . __eou__ Thank you . I will . __eou__

I don't want any interruptions every other minute , but you can ask me at the end of the letter . __eou__ All right . I understand now . Do you think I should leave a margin on every page wide enough for notes and amendments . __eou__ Of course , Diana . You'd better pay attention to the spelling when you type it . __eou__ Certainly I will , Mr . Robbins . By the way , may I use a window envelope ? __eou__ Yes , that's fine . Now when you finish these , I want you to put these cards in alphabetical order , using the last names , and then make a list . __eou__ You want the cards in alphabetical order using the last names ? __eou__ Right . And the last thing , we are going to clean the files out tomorrow . Now let's begin . __eou__

About how many units would you need ? __eou__ Just give me an estimated figure for an order of 100 units . __eou__ Please give me a few minute to calculate ... Our asking price should be about $ 100 per unit with an order of 100 . Is that price acceptable to you ? __eou__ Your estimated is seems a little high to me , we're willing to pay $ 80 per unit . __eou__ Would an order of only 100 units , it'll be difficult to work within that kind of budget .

If it's better than the one you are doing now , go for it . That's my advice . __eou__ It isn't that easy . I hate to quit my present job . People around here are very nice and the work itself is challenging . __eou__ Then what about the salary ? Would you get more ? __eou__ Yes , they say I would get a big sum . __eou__ Have you discussed it with your wife ? __eou__ Yes , she leaves it to me . __eou__ As I say it the work is well worth try .

Ikebana , it's an art of flowers and it's quite different from Western style flower arrangement because in Ikebana's theory you can decorate one flower , only with one flower . __eou__ What's another Japanese art ? __eou__ Japanese art ? Mm , Ikebana ! Tea Ceremony ! __eou__ Tea Ceremony ! Tell me about Tea Ceremony . __eou__ Tea Ceremony ! It's , there's a certain way you have to make tea , not only make tea , there's a certain way to for example wipe a bowl . __eou__ I see . __eou__ Yes , with one piece of cloth , and you need to learn how to fold the cloth so that you you use each part of the cloth only once to wipe the bowl __eou__ How do you learn that ? Is that something that your mother would teach you ? How do people learn that ? __eou__ There's some professionals for both flower arrangement and tea ceremony . So you need to go to a school , yes , and learn from your teacher and their hierarchy and the organization and you need to pass each test to go , climb up the ladder in the hierarchy . __eou__
Good morning , sir ! Can I help you ? __eou__ Good morning ! I'd like to buy twelve tickets to Beijing for October 14th . __eou__ Yes , sir .

The problem is that the window unit isn ’ t powerful enough . __eou__ I guess not , huh . __eou__ Well , I ’ m going to move out anyway . The new apartment has central air-conditioning . __eou__ You should have moved out long , long ago . __eou__ Well , I had to wait until the lease expired . So ... __eou__ So how can you stand the heat ? __eou__ Well , I open the windows and ... and I ’ Ve got an electric fan ere . It helps a little . __eou__
I hate computer games . __eou__ Why ? They are fine . __eou__ Because they are too violent . Some of them are even disgusting . __eou__ Indeed there are bad games . But many of them are good . __eou__ If boys grow up with computer games , they will surely become bad . __eou__ Come on . Things are not so bad . Boys can learn to use the computer through games . __eou__
Do you still see the people we went to school with ? __eou__ I did for a while , I suppose , until I left university , but after that not really . __eou__ Yeah , I've lost touch with most people as well , but I still see Rose occasionally . __eou__ Oh yes , how's she getting on ? __eou__ OK , I suppose , but she's had a rough time in the last few years , She got divorced . __eou__ What , from Peter ? __eou__ Oh , of course . __eou__

I've just got a new printer . How often do I need to replace the print heads ? __eou__ Well , under normal conditions each head lasts about 5 000 copies or so . It depends on the user , but about once a month is average . __eou__ So if I don't print out very much , it could last a lot longer ? __eou__ That's right . It could last six months or more . This model's designed for heavy use . Don't worry - you'll get an error message telling you when to change the head . __eou__
Has my package arrived ? __eou__ I'm not sure . What does it look like ? __eou__ It's quite a delicate piece of equipment , so I hope it was well-packed . It's oblong-shaped , about 50 cm long .

Is it true that one of our competitors is planning to launch their tracking service next month ? __eou__ That would be WebTracker . We're heard they're almost ready . That's why we have to finish first . __eou__ Or they'll take over the market before we even get started . __eou__ Right . And that would be a total giga-bummer . __eou__ I guess we'd better get back to work . __eou__
Tomorrow I will be the new owner of all dad's assets . __eou__ It still feels really strange to me . __eou__ I know . I miss him terribly . __eou__ How does it feel to be in charge of so much money ? __eou__ I thought I would feel like I was in the lap of Luxury . __eou__ I guess you could choose that if you wanted . __eou__ No , I think I will run things much the same way that Dad did . __eou__ Dad really knew what he was doing when he chose you to take over for him when he was gone ! __eou__
Wow , it has a balcony . __eou__ Yeah . Complete with nice of you . __eou__ How many windows are there in the apartment ? __eou__ Mm , let me see . I think there are 2 in the bedroom , and 1 each in the living room and kitchen . __eou__ It ’ s just what I want . I think I am ready to sign . __eou__ I call the landlord right now . __eou__ Before you send the lease , do you have any questions ? __eou__ Yes , does the renting include utilities ? __eou__ It includes everything except cable TV , and telephone . __eou__ How much is the cable ? __eou__ It usually comes out about $ 40 a month . __eou__ Also , are they allowing the apartment ? __eou__ No , I am afraid the apartment isn ’ t permitted . __eou__ I see . Do you love pets ? __eou__ Sorry , that ’ s out of question . I don ’ t have a problem with it . But , unfortunately , the building doesn ’ t allow it . It ’ s a building regulation . __eou__
Jim , I heard you took a trip to San Diego . Is that right ? __eou__ Yeah , I just got back this morning . __eou__ That sounds really nice . What did you do there ? __eou__ Well , we were only there for three days , so we didn't do too much . We went shopping and went out to dinner a few times . And at night we walked around the city with some friends . __eou__ Did you take any pictures ? __eou__ Yes , I have them with me . Do you want to look at them ? __eou__ Sure , I love looking at photos . __eou__ This one is of my wife and me on the beach , and this one is our daughter Emily standing next to my wife . __eou__ Your daughter looks like her mother . __eou__ I know , they look very similar . __eou__ Where was this picture taken ? __eou__ That was taken at the train station before we left . __eou__ Did you have time to go to the zoo ? __eou__ No , not this time . We went there last time . __eou__ It looks like you all had a nice time . __eou__ Yeah , it was a lot of fun . __eou__

How many people does your company employ ? __eou__ We have over sixty employees . We have about forty factory workers and technical people and the rest are admin and sales staff .

Can you help me ? The program is not responding and I don't know what to do . __eou__ Look at the icon in the bottom corner of your screen . Is it flashing ? __eou__ No . It isn't . __eou__ OK . Try closing down all the files you're not using at the moment . __eou__ But I can't move the cursor at all . My screen is frozen . What should I do ? __eou__ Have you tried pressing the Escape key ? __eou__ Yes , but nothing's happened . __eou__ OK , you ’ ll need to reboot your machine . Press Control , Alt and Delete at the same time . __eou__ I've never done that before . Will I lose all my files ? __eou__ You might lose the file you were working on , but don't worry , the help desk can restore it . When did you last take a backup ? __eou__
Our supervisor Lester does . Actually , Lester is kind of like the kitchen god . __eou__ The kitchen god ? What does he do ? __eou__ He just stays in the kitchen and watches you . Before the Chinese New Year , the kitchen god tells his boss whether you were good or bad this year . Just like Lester does ! __eou__ Oh , no ! I did a lot of bad things this year . I hope the kitchen god isn't like Lester--he blabs my mistakes to everybody ! __eou__ Actually , there's a way to keep the kitchen god from telling the bad things you did . __eou__ What is it ? Tell me ! Will it work for Lester , too ? __eou__ I think so ! Just serve a lot of sweet dishes next week . That will make the kitchen god say sweet things about you ! __eou__ Hmm . Are you sure that will work ? I already tried giving chocolate to Lester . __eou__ And what happened ? __eou__ His face broke out and he said it was my fault ! __eou__
Tell me something about your work experience . __eou__ Well , I have been in the computer engineering field for 6 years now .

My name is Kathy Pewless , the representative of Green Textile Import and Export Corporation . __eou__ Pleased to meet you too , Ms . Pewless . I travel a lot every year on business , but this is my first visit to your country . I must say I have been much impressed by your friendly people . __eou__ Thank you for saying so . Have you seen the exhibition halls ? On display are most of our products , such as silk , woolen knitwear , cotton piece goods , and garments . __eou__ Oh , yes . I had a look yesterday . I found some of the exhibits to be fine in quality and beautiful in design . The exhibition has successfully displayed to me what your corporation handles . I ’ Ve gone over the catalogue and the pamphlets enclosed in your last letter . I ’ Ve got some idea of your exports . I ’ m interested in your silk blouses . __eou__ Our silk is known for its good quality . It is one of our trade - trional exports . Silk blouses are brightly colored and beau - fully designed . They ’ Ve met with great favor overseas and are always in great demand . __eou__
How are you doing , Andrew ? __eou__ Not well . I ’ Ve been feeling pretty lonely lately . __eou__ But you have so many friends ! How could you be lonely ? __eou__ You know what they say'a friend to all is a friend to none ' . I don ’ t feel like I really know any of my friends . In fact , I should probably call them acquaintances , not friends . __eou__ What about me ? I ’ m your friend . __eou__ I know you are , you are my girlfriend . I wish I had a guy friend to hang out with sometimes . __eou__ I know what you mean . I find it difficult to make new friends , too . It ’ s not as easy as it was when we were young , is it ? __eou__ Not at all . __eou__ I ’ Ve made a lot of new friends since I started learning English . Maybe you could join a club or take a class to make some new friends . __eou__ That ’ s a good idea . __eou__ What kind of qualities do you look for in a friend ? __eou__ I ’ m not sure . I guess I ’ d like to meet some people who have a positive attitude and want to have a good time . __eou__ People who play ultimate Frisbee have a positive attitude ; maybe you should join the ultimate Frisbee club . __eou__ That ’ s a possibility . Thanks ! __eou__
Excuse me , I ’ Ve been waiting here for fifteen minutes.Do you know why the traffic is so heavy ? __eou__ A lorry overturned on the road and blocked it , so all the traffic was held up . __eou__ Oh , what a terrible situation ! This traffic is unbearable . __eou__ Yeah , traffic was brought to a standstill by the accident . If we had gone early we would miss the traffic . __eou__ I agree with you . But now we have to wait . The sky is overcast , and it is very sultry . I fear a thunder storm is brewing . __eou__ Don ’ t worry . The traffic jam is said to be over soon . __eou__ Yes , I hope so . Thank you for telling me this . __eou__ It ’ s my pleasure . __eou__
The fried shrimp is crunchy ! But my mom will never cook shrimp this way . She always says that fried food is not healthy . __eou__ How does she cook the shrimp ? __eou__ She often cooks it in a large pan of boiling water . __eou__ I don't like that . I like fried food , fried potatoes , fried chicken , fried sausage ... I can't see why fried food is not healthy . __eou__ My mom says it has a lot of fat . I also suggest you do not eat so many fried things . __eou__ It's all right ! I often fry sausages when my mom is not at home . __eou__ Really ? I really want to have a try ! __eou__ Come to my house this Sunday . My mom will not be at home then . We can cook some wonderful fried food by ourselves ! __eou__ That sounds like a good idea ! But I'm afraid my mom will be angry about it . __eou__
Thank god you are open ! I have an emergency ! __eou__ Hello , Mr . Henderson what can I do for you ? __eou__ I need this dress and this suit dry cleaned ASAP ! __eou__ OK , I can have it ready by the end of the week . __eou__ No , you don ’ t understand , I need this tomorrow morning ! I accidentally spilled beer all over my wife ’ s dress and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow ! She ’ s gonna kill me ! __eou__ OK , I can have it ready tomorrow afternoon , but this suit is also very stained . I can ’ t guarantee we can remove it completely . __eou__ Fine ! Can you also iron and starch this shirt ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__ Great ! This is our secret ! If you see my wife , say nothing to her about this ! __eou__
Do you know what time it is ? __eou__ Um . Ten ? __eou__ Get in this door young man . It ’ s midnight , you are two hours past curfew . __eou__ I know , but it wasn ’ t my fault ! I told Jennifer she had to drop me off before ten , but she wouldn ’ t leave the party ! __eou__ I don ’ t care ! You are grounded for life , mister ! __eou__ Mom ! That is so unfair ! __eou__ You know the rules and you broke them . No allowance and no TV for a week . I usually never ground you but this time I have to put my foot down ! __eou__ What ! For being a couple of hours late ? You have to be kidding ! __eou__ I don ’ t want to hear it ! Now go to your room ! __eou__
How long will it take to learn English ? Will I be able to take other courses next semester or will English take up all of my time ? __eou__ It ’ s hard to say . Language isn ’ t like other studies . __eou__ You mean I could finish this course and still not know English ? You ’ Ve got to be kidding ! __eou__ I ’ m not kidding . Learning a language is a question of forming language habits and that takes time . __eou__ So do we have to stay in this English class forever ? __eou__ No . You just have to stay here long enough to get some orientation . Then you go on practicing and learning outside . A lot of learning depends on your personal motivation . __eou__ So it ’ s really the same story . Practice , practice , practice and more practice is the only way to learn a language . __eou__ You said it . __eou__
David , imagine meeting you here ! __eou__ Janice , I found you stole my vegetables at four o'clock this morning . Is that true ? __eou__ All right ! I stayed up yesterday and waited for your vegetables . I stole your peaches and flowers . __eou__ It is so hard to prevent them from being stolen . I also got something this morning . __eou__ How many vegetables do you steal today ? __eou__ I stole many from Fred's farm , and from yours . I planned to have a dog on farm . __eou__ So funny . By stealing , I forgot all my sorrows and pressure from work . __eou__ I could not agree with you more . For us , there are so many unhappy things and I am so bored ; however , I got lots of fun from stealing . __eou__ I really want to be far away from the reality now . __eou__ But we still need to go back to it . Don't overdo it . __eou__
Hey Jack . How's it going ? __eou__ I'm falling in love . __eou__ What ! With who ? __eou__ That girl in my econ class . She is so hot . __eou__ Did you guys go on a date already ? __eou__ No . I didn't even talk to her yet . But I think I'm in love . __eou__ Does she have a boyfriend ? __eou__ I don't think so . I've been following her around campus and I haven't seen another guy . __eou__ Dude , you're a stalker man . Just ask her on a date . __eou__ I plan on running into her in the cafeteria when she's alone . I think I'll ask her then . __eou__ So why do you think you're in love ? __eou__ She's the only thing I can think of all day long . __eou__ That's called blind love . Well , I gotta run . Tell me how it goes next week . __eou__ Aright . I'll talk to you later . __eou__

What happened ? __eou__ Well , she told me things just weren ’ t working out and we weren ’ t right together . But I thought things were just great . Why did she say this ? It's completely out of the blue . __eou__ Hey , that ’ s not the girl with pink hair , is it ? The girl I saw with Jack yesterday . __eou__ What ? She was cheating on me with that ugly guy . Oh , no , I feel like such a loser . __eou__ Hey , she is not worth it . Forget her . __eou__ But she lied to me . __eou__ Hey , she is not worth it . Anyway , there are plenty more fish in the sea . Listen , let's go for a drink in the town . How about that ? __eou__ Ok , then . __eou__ But you have to promise me that you are not gonna wear that face . __eou__ What face ? __eou__ The one where you look like your dog just died . You have to get over her and the sooner the better . __eou__ Yeah , I know . You are right . __eou__
Aren ’ t you going to swim ? __eou__ Are you kidding ? Don't you know I can't swim ? __eou__ You are not telling me that we drove 50 miles to come here for just sunbath , are you ? __eou__ Hey , don't shout . Come here ! Sit closer . Now , Jim , we ’ Ve had a lovely day . Don't spoil it now . __eou__ What about your beautiful bathing suit ? We shopped all day . Don't you want to show it off ? __eou__ Everybody who walks past me sees it . Besides , it's a good sunbathing suit . __eou__ All right . Suit yourself . I am going swimming . __eou__ Jim ! __eou__ Yes ? __eou__ Can you get me a beach umbrella and a deck chair ? I am really tired of lying in thousand . __eou__ I've got a better idea . Why don ’ t we hire a boat and go for a ride ? What do you think ? __eou__ Are you serious ? That will be wonderful ! __eou__

Would you like to have lunch some day next week ? __eou__ Sure . How about Monday ? __eou__ Hmm . I'm afraid I can't make it on Monday . I've got to fly to Chicago on business . __eou__ Well unfortunately , I'm tied up on Tuesday . I'm supposed to have lunch with an important visitor from out of town , and I don't think there's any way I can get out of it.Are you free on Wednesday ? __eou__ Wednesday ? Let me see . Hmm . Somehow I think I've already got something scheduled for Wednesday . Oh , yes ! I've got an appointment with my dentist to have my teeth cleaned , and it's essential that I keep it . __eou__ Well , I'm afraid Thursday is out for me . I'm expected to attend a meeting of our personnel committee , and it's very important for me to be there . __eou__ So that leaves Friday . I don't have any obligations or commitments on Friday.How about you ? __eou__ Friday sounds good . Where should we meet ? __eou__ You know , I really must be going now or I'll be very late . Can you give me a call tomorrow an we'll decide ? __eou__
What kind of insurance could the company provide for its employees ? __eou__ All staff can enjoy the health insurance program . __eou__ What if an employee was injured due to work-related job ? __eou__ Employees are covered by worker's compensation insurance . __eou__
You bet it is . And we got four thousand for our car space ! Awesome ! __eou__ Let's play some music ! I feel like dancing . __eou__ That's just what was running through my mind . Moonlight and dancing . __eou__ Ahh ! Now that's more like it . Atmosphere ! __eou__ Come on baby , let's dance ! __eou__ Oops ! It's the landlord . I guess the tables have turned now . We're the noisy neighbors . Turn it down ! __eou__
Then , Mary . We need 10 more loose-leaf binders , five pounds of heavy duty white paper , and what else did I say ? __eou__ Two boxes of transparencies for the over-head machines . __eou__ Right . And I ’ d like one of those new electric pencil sharpeners . __eou__ All right , Mr . Jones . Do you think we ’ ll need anything else ? __eou__
Hello , is everything alright ? Can I help ? __eou__ I have a Promissory Note , but it's not called that . It's a Bill of Exchange . __eou__ Similar to a Promissory Note , yes . I can deal with that for you right here . The difference between a Promissory Note and a Bill of Exchange is that this product is transferable and can bind one party to pay a third party that was not involved in its creation . __eou__ So , even if someone wasn't directly involved , they can become involved ? Like the bank you cash it in ? __eou__ That's right . We didn't issue it to you , but technically we are buying it from you . So , we become involved . __eou__ I see . Sorry about this , I'm new in this job and I've never even seen one of these before ! My boss just told me to come here and sort it out . __eou__ As long as you have all of the documentation we require you have nothing to worry about . __eou__
I'd like to buy one of these refrigerators . Do I have to pay in cash ? __eou__ No , we have an easy-payment plan . One-third down , and the balance in six months . __eou__ Fine . Will you work out the details , please ? __eou__ Certainly . Would you sit here please ? I'll call our credit manager . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ It's just a formality , but for hire purchase we usually require references . __eou__ What kind of references do you need ? __eou__ Perhaps your employer could supply us with one . __eou__ I'm sure he could , but I prefer not to bother him . Would my bank do ? __eou__ Certainly . A simple letter from your bank would be quite satisfactory . __eou__
If you're observant you'll see rare birds , insects , butterflies , and a few reptiles . But you must look for them . There are also a few am-phibians in lower places . __eou__ Well , let's move , I can see a rest area ahead.We can relax there , and see what wildlife is around ... __eou__ Huh ! I am really out-of-shape , Why aren't you out-of-breath ? __eou__ Because I come hiking every week . That's why I'm in good-shape . I think that I should bring you a walkingstick next time . __eou__ How can you say that ? But , you could give me a piggyback the rest of the way . __eou__ So , you want me to carry your backpack , your thermos flask , our picnic , and you as well . No problem , jump on . __eou__
Mom , am I like a superman ? All I need is a cape . __eou__ No , just a super-boy . __eou__ Mom , you always think of me as a child . __eou__ Yes , because a real man doesn't need Mom to worry about him so much . He can do things by himself . __eou__ Sure ! __eou__ Oh , my poor Danny , sure , you are a man . But you know , running like this in street is very dangerous . __eou__ Superman is not afraid of any danger . __eou__ Do you remember the rules of road safety ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ Walk the sidewalk and please right-hand side . __eou__ Don't play on the street or make any noise . __eou__ Yes , so you still remember , ah . __eou__ Dear Mom , please permit of superman's naughty . __eou__
Jack , what's wrong ? __eou__ You ! __eou__ What are you talking about ? What did I do ? __eou__ You told Martha that I was on a date ? What was that all about ? __eou__ No ... that's not what I meant . I didn't mean that . She asked me where you were and I jokingly said that you were on a date with Sara . I thought Martha knew that you and Sara were just friends . __eou__ She started feeling suspicious after you said that . __eou__ I'm sorry man . I didn't know . I didn't mean to screw anything up . __eou__ Martha gets jealous easily and it took a while to convince her that Sara was just a friend . Now , I have to explain to Sara that I can't hang around her because of you . __eou__ Look . I really didn't mean to , and next time I see Martha , I'll really tell her that you and Sara are really just friends . __eou__ Don't bother . __eou__
Hi , Mary , I didn't see you at work this morning . Are you all right ? __eou__ Oh , I feel miserable . I've got a bad cold , My head is dizzy and my nose is running . __eou__ Oh , I'm so sorry to hear that . Have you seen a doctor or taken any medicines ? __eou__ As a matter of fact I have , The doctor said it'll go away after a day or two.He ' s prescribed me some tablets . __eou__ Are you feeling better ? __eou__ Yes , it helps me but I just have to wait and let my system do the work . __eou__ Do you need anything , grocery ? __eou__ Oh , no , I'm fine.My refrigerator is piled up with food.But if it's not too much trouble for you . I'd like something to read . __eou__ Sure , I'll get it for you.Books or magazines ? __eou__ I'd like both . __eou__
I'm going to the park to play baseball with the guys . __eou__ But you promised to play chess with me this afternoon . __eou__ Yeah , but that was before the guys ask me to join the team . __eou__ So what ? __eou__ You know how much I want to be on the team , and now there is an opening for me.If I don't go to practise today.They ' ll get someone else and I'll miss my chance . __eou__ I don't care about baseball.You know I need to practice for the chess championship and you promised to help with me if I washed the dishes for you last Sunday , and I did . __eou__ I know , and I will . __eou__ When ? __eou__ After baseball practice . __eou__ And then , it'll be dinner time , then homework , and then your Show is on.You are going to break your promise . __eou__ No , I won't . I'm going to skip TV tonight and work on your chess game with you if that's ok with you . __eou__ Well , I'd rather do it the way we set up.But if you promise to give me your best game , it's ok with me . __eou__ No problem , I'll play as hard as I can and give you an extra game to say thanks . __eou__
Just dab it all over your face and then take a look at the symbols that appear . __eou__ Yeah ... hearts , stars and some weird looking things . __eou__ Those are money bags , and they represent your financial situation . __eou__ So decode this for me , Madame Psycho . __eou__ That's Madame Psychic to you . __eou__ I'm waiting ... __eou__ Well , you have three hearts — lucky in love tonight . Dress up and go on a date ! __eou__
Excuse me . Is anyone in that seat next to you ? __eou__ No , I don't think so . __eou__ Do you mind if I put my jacket there ? __eou__ No . It's no problem.Are you American ? __eou__ Yes . And you ? __eou__ No . I'm from Taiwan . Can't you see ? __eou__ Well , there are many Chinese Americans , you know.And your English is very good . You sound like an American . __eou__ I don't think so . You are flattering me . __eou__ No , really . I can only hear a little accent . __eou__ Are you flying home ? __eou__ Well , yes . Actually , I'm going back to visit . __eou__ You were visiting Taiwan ? __eou__ No , I'm going back to America to visit . I'm from America , but I don't live there now . I live in Taichung . __eou__ Really ! You live in Taiwan ! __eou__ Yes . Why not ? __eou__ May I ask what your job is in Taiwan ? __eou__ Sure . I teach history in a university . Have you heard of Dong-Hai University ? __eou__ Of course . It's a good school . How long have you lived in Taichung ? __eou__ I have lived in Taichung for two years now.So this is the second time I am going back to states . I go back once a year to visit my family . __eou__ It must be strange for you to live in Taiwan . __eou__ No , it isn't strange at all.Many people from Taiwan move to America too , you know.Do you think it is strange for them ? __eou__ No . Well , I don't know.But Taiwan is so crowded . Don't you miss life in America ? __eou__
There are some things I miss . But I love Chinese food.And I think the people in Taiwan are really hospitable.Besides , I grew up in Los Angeles , so I'm used to living in crowded places.Why are you going to America ? __eou__ I'm going to New York to visit my sister . She is in art school . I've never been to New York before . I'm kind of scared . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ Well , I know a lot of people have guns there . I think maybe it isn't too safe . __eou__ Don't worry about it.Your sister lives there . She probably knows the places in town you shouldn't go.It ' s true there are some dangerous places in big American cities.But if your sister lives there , she must know the city pretty well already . __eou__ Yes , I'm not really scared . Maybe only a little . __eou__ Don't believe what you see on TV . You will have a good time in New York.What things do you want to see ? __eou__ I want to see the museums , and I want to shop a lot . __eou__ The museums are excellent . And the shopping ! Well ! I'm sure you'll spend a lot of money there . __eou__ Hmm . I hope not . __eou__

You'll gain a lot in the following job . __eou__ Yeah , I believe it , but I want to know if you will give me a raise . __eou__ B , talking about salary is not smart . You are a new manager and you'd better learn more professional skills . __eou__ You are right , boss , but I need specific confirm to keep the future work better . __eou__ Okay , You are such a good talker . __eou__
Bob , can I talk to you for a minute ? There have been some developments for the Stewart case that I really need to talk to you about . __eou__ Yeah , what's the matter now ? We've had so much trouble with this case already . Don't tell me there's more bad news . __eou__ Well , I'm afraid there is . I have some bad news for you about the results of the forensic tests ... there won't be any results . __eou__ What ? What does that mean ? Why won't there be any results ? __eou__ I hate to tell you this , but it seems that every shred of evidence that would help us to convict were destroyed in a laboratory fire . There's nothing left . I'm so sorry ... __eou__ Oh , no , you can't be serious . I never expect anything like this would happened . What are we going to do ? __eou__ There's nothing that can be done . Everything is gone . I wish I could tell you differently , but what has happened has happened . We will just have to figure out a way to move on . __eou__
Oh , my God ! What's this ? __eou__ What ? __eou__ Look ! This window is open . __eou__ Did you open it before we left ? __eou__ Are you kidding ? It's winter . Why would I open it ? __eou__ I don't know . Wait . Is this yours ? __eou__ No ! Oh , my God ! Someone has broken into the house . __eou__ It looks that way . That's probably why the door wasn't locked when we came in . __eou__ I locked it when I left though . __eou__ Yes , but the robber broke in.Then , when he left , he left through the door . So it wasn't locked . __eou__ I don't care about that , Allen ! What did he steal ? That's the question ! __eou__ Look around . __eou__ The TV's still here . __eou__ And your stereo too . So what did he steal ? We have to go look upstairs . __eou__ But what if someone's still up there ? __eou__ I don't think there will be . He left through the door , remember ? __eou__

Bake it forty-five minutes at 360 degrees . __eou__ Now , I've got it . Thank you . __eou__

Professor wang can I ask a few questions ? __eou__ Certainly . __eou__ What is the tariff ? __eou__ It's a tax levy by the goveroverment on goods imported into that country . __eou__ Why does the government levy the tariff ? __eou__ Tariff provides the government with extra tax revenue . __eou__ Anything else . __eou__ Tariff raises the price at which the goods are sold in the importing country and therefore makes them less competitive with locally produced goods . __eou__ Oh , I know . Thank you . Professor wang . __eou__ Do not mention it . __eou__

Do you consider yourself a good mother ? __eou__ Yes , I'm a very good mother and successful career woman . __eou__ How can you manage to do both ? I mean , it is so hard to be a working mother . __eou__ I think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself , like keeping housework simple , spending money on things that make life easier , buying yourself things you like , and so on . You can only be nice to others when you can be nice to yourself . __eou__ Does your husband feel the same ? __eou__ Yes . He is very understanding and supportive . __eou__

How do I make a good impression in the interview ? __eou__ You should try to put your best foot forward , and be careful of your personal appearance . At least you should get yourself dressed up . Appearance isnt everything , but it's the first thing an interviewer notices about you . __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ Don ’ t boast and don ’ t be modest . __eou__ What do you mean by this ? You can ’ t do the two things at the same time . __eou__ Appear confident and show the interviewers that you ’ re competent . Don ’ t exaggerate things or you'll give the impression that you ’ re talking big . __eou__ I see . __eou__ Try to be natural , alert and interested . __eou__ You ’ Ve given me very valuable advice and I have more confidence in myself now . Thank you very much . __eou__ My pleasure . Good luck to you . __eou__
Jack , I think it's best that I actively ask for the results of interview . __eou__ That's a good idea ! So you don't need to worry about it . __eou__ I think so , too . What do you think about that I write a letter of inquiry to the company ? __eou__ It's OK . You could send an email to the employer via the internet . __eou__ Good idea . It is convenient and fast . __eou__ You could inquire about the results directly , but should be politely . __eou__ Certainly . __eou__ I think the letter of inquiry should be written briefly . If it's too long , I'm afraid the employer won't have time to read it . __eou__ I think that about one hundred words are enough . __eou__ After you send the letter of inquiry , you should pay close attention not to miss any reply . __eou__ OK , I know now . __eou__
Dave , there's something I want to talk to you about . __eou__ Zina , why are you whispering ? __eou__ I've been talking to WebTracker . I'm thinking of jumping ship . __eou__ What ?

But no one else , OK ? __eou__ Yes , Mr . Hammer . __eou__

How much do I need to spend ? __eou__ The minimum is 100 RIB , and the maximum is 500,000 RIB . __eou__ How about Bearer Certificates ? Are they different ? __eou__ Yes , they are different because they are printed by the Ministry of Finance in set amounts . Just 100 RIB , 500 RIB and 1,000 RIB , you cannot choose from many amounts , you see . __eou__
Look , there's no way we can convince people they need fresh motor oil every morning . __eou__ No , but you can let them know that yours is the cream of the crop-the purest motor oil in the world . Careful , hold it by the java jacket . This coffee drink has half and half-what do you think ? __eou__ It tastes funny . Why can't people just stick to plain and simple coffee ? __eou__ That's just the point ! Purity is the essence of good coffee , right ? __eou__
It sounds that you have a high opinion of him . __eou__ He is an all-right guy . I have no bone to pick with him . __eou__ Birds of feather flock together . __eou__ But he is not a fine wether friend who could sell you down the river . __eou__ You cannot judge a person that way . I have a hunch that he is a sly dog . __eou__ Depends on with whom . He may be doing things on the sly , but he is honest with me . I trust him . __eou__ You can never tell . He might do you in when he sees an angle in doing it . __eou__

Can you guarantee continuous production and adequate supply ? __eou__ Yes , of course . We have enough productivity . You can rest assured . __eou__ And for such a big quantity , you should give us a discount . __eou__ Sure , we can reduce our price by ten percent . __eou__ That's great . __eou__
Well , to come straight to the point , could you tell us something about your new price ? __eou__ Most willingly . It's 600 dollars per ton . __eou__ That's a high price . __eou__ But you know , the price of this article has soared up since last year . __eou__ I know . But I must say it's still unacceptable . Couldn't you make a discount for me ? You see , we have such a long-term cooperation . And our business could be mutually beneficial . __eou__ OK . I can make a special offer for you . This price is based on careful calculations . And it is the lowest price we can offer to you . __eou__
Thank god you showed up when you did ! He ’ s insane ! Do you think we should call the police ? __eou__ Don ’ t worry about it , I ’ ll call my friend and have him take care of it . I can ’ t believe he was stalking you all these years . What a nut job ! __eou__ I know ! Well ... he said I ’ m not pregnant . I ’ m sorry if I got you all worked up over nothing . I want you to know that I didn ’ t do it on purpose ... __eou__ Don ’ t apologize ! From the moment I met you , not a day has gone by when I haven ’ t thought of you.And now that I ’ m with you again , I ’ m ... I ’ m just scared , Veronica . The closer I get to you , the worse it gets . The thought of not being with you , I mean , I just can ’ t handle it ! We were made for each other , Veronica . You are my everything , my soul mate . What can I do ? __eou__ Just hold me ... I ’ ll always be here for you , no matter what . And together , we can tackle whatever life throws at us . I believe in us , steven . __eou__ I ’ m so happy to hear that ! I knew we belong together . I love you so much . __eou__
... so , I said , let ’ s take a break.And since that night , I ’ Ve been waiting for him to call , but I still haven ’ t heard from him . You don ’ t think he ’ s seeing someone else , do you ? __eou__ Come on , don ’ t be so dramatic ! I ’ m sure everything is going to work out just fine . __eou__ You think so ? Oh , no ! How can he do this to me ? I ’ m sure he ’ s cheating on me ! Why else wouldn ’ t he call ? __eou__ But , you two are on a break . Theoretically he can do whatever he likes . __eou__ He ’ s the love of my life ! I ’ Ve really messed this up . __eou__ Come on , hon . Pull yourself together . It ’ s going to be alright . __eou__ But I ... I still love him ! And it ’ s all my fault ! I can ’ t believe how immature and selfish I was being . I mean , he is a firefighter , it ’ s not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner . I ’ Ve totally messed this up ! __eou__ You know what , Veronica , I think you should make the first step . I ’ m sure he ’ ll forgive you ... __eou__ No , this is not gonna happen ! I ... I ’ Ve ruined everything ... __eou__ do you hear something ? __eou__
Did your eye doctor prescribe you contact lenses ? __eou__ No , I ’ d like to know something about contact lenses . __eou__ Oh , I see . We have both hard and soft contact lenses . They are very popular , but a little more expensive than ordinary glasses . __eou__ I have found I ’ m short-sighted recently . I need to wear glasses . As a student , it ’ s better for me to wear ordinary glasses instead of contact lenses . __eou__ We have many kinds of glasses here . Which frames do you like best ? __eou__ I think the square-shaped ones will be the best for me . __eou__ What about this pair ? They are the ' in ' things now in optical wear . Try them on . __eou__ They fit me very well . I like them . __eou__ Please go to receive optometry first over there . __eou__
My mom and dad insist that I be home before ten . Do you have a curfew ? __eou__ Yes . I've had one for as long as I can remember . __eou__ I wish my parents were a little more lenient . __eou__ I actually like having a curfew . I have an excuse to get to bed on time . __eou__ You like going to bed early ? __eou__ I don't like being too tired the next day . __eou__ Well , I still hate having a curfew . __eou__ If you stayed up much later , you would see that just about every-thing closes around ten anyway . __eou__
I'd love that . I'm so glad I quit . It's time for a change . __eou__ Does that mean you're going to take my advice ? __eou__ Yes . I'm looking for a position as a chef . __eou__ I might be able to help ... __eou__ I'm sure you have great connections . __eou__ We'd like to open another restaurant ... with you as the head chef and manager ... __eou__ Really ? You have that much faith in me ? And Giovanni agreed to it ? Does he know who I am ? __eou__ Yes . But you know him . He's just worried that you're not Italian ... __eou__ He's prejudiced , isn't he ? __eou__ No . He's afraid that no one will cook as good as his mother did . __eou__ Ah ! I know a way to convince him that Americans can make good Italian food ! __eou__ How's that ? __eou__ You'll see next week . I'll come by one day at lunchtime . __eou__
Judy , what do you think of the new general manager ? __eou__ He has extensive experience , although the guy ’ s really deep , sometimes , it scares me . __eou__ I heard he's very clear about his likes and dislikes and he's not the type to just let things go , so don ’ t provoke him . __eou__ I know , and that's why I'm always respectful and I keep my distance . It's safer that way . __eou__ Me too , I don't know why , but every time I see the guy , I break into a cold sweat . __eou__ It's in the eyes . They're the type that seems to look into your soul , making one really uneasy . __eou__ Whatever we said , we must be more careful . __eou__ Yes , I agree with you . __eou__
Tristan , could you stay a few extra minutes to discuss your project with me ? __eou__ Sure . We're on a pretty tight schedule , but we should be able to finish it just on time . __eou__ Are all of your team members on schedule ? __eou__ A few of the graphic designers are a bit behind in their work because of computer problems . __eou__ How have they decided to deal with that ? __eou__ They've agreed to work over-time until it's finished . They've even decided to come in on the weekend . __eou__ That's true dedication . I'm impressed . When is it due ? __eou__ We agreed that the deadline was next Friday . __eou__ Right . Well , given that your colleagues are working so hard on this project , I suppose we could change that deadline to Monday morning , I won't have time to look over it on the weekend anyway . __eou__ That'd be very helpful . An extra weekend is all they really need . Thanks . __eou__ That's alright . Make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the new deadline . __eou__ I will . __eou__ I know you have a tight schedule , so I won't take up more of your time . Have a good evening . __eou__ You , too ! See you tomorrow . __eou__
Welcome to NO Bank . It's Mr Zu , isn't it ? __eou__ Ah , Jenny ! You remember me , what a good memory you have . __eou__ How's Mrs Zu doing these days ? __eou__ She's fine , thanks . Actually , she's the reason I'm here . It's our Wedding Anniversary in 2 weeks and I want to get her something special . She's been nagging me about our furniture , you see . __eou__ Can I give you some advice on a loan , or ... __eou__ I would like to cash my undue Large-Amount Deposit Certificate , please . __eou__ Are you absolutely sure , Mr Zu ? You know , you will lose interest if you do . __eou__ Yes , I know . But it can't be helped . It's been a pretty slow month and I just don't have enough cash to refurnish the whole house . __eou__ Let me run through a couple of other options with you . That way , you can make a more informed decision . __eou__
Is there any way we could get a better warranty on this product ? __eou__ Well , I can't give you a better warranty , if you would be willing to agree to an annual contract . __eou__ That might not be ideal because there would be some drawbacks to an annual contract situation that might make it difficult to sell to our buyers . What about free delivery ? If we make a large enough order , could you waive the deliver fee ? __eou__ Yes , our delivery fee could be waived , if you make an order of 50 units or more . We would have to insist on the annual contract , however . I understand it's not the most convenient for you . Perhaps we could shorten it to a sixth month contract if you are willing to take a lower rebate . __eou__ That would be fine . We could accept a lower rebate . __eou__
Are you still hungry , Ryan ? How about some more squid balls ? __eou__ Squid balls ? How about some more fruit ! __eou__ Wow ! You really like fruit , huh ? You've already had 3 plates ! __eou__ Yeah , it's funny . I usually don't ever eat fruit ... __eou__ Well , whatever suits your fancy . I'll press the service button again . __eou__
Is that true ? __eou__ I guess so . Now Anna's got four kids and another on the way . __eou__ Wow . She looks good for having had that many kids . She's pregnant and wearing Prada ! __eou__ That's Anna for you . She keeps up the image of the stylish Italian woman . Here she comes . __eou__ She's glowing . It must be the pregnancy . __eou__ Yeah , or the expensive Italian facial treatments . __eou__
what kind of qualities do you look for in your friends ? __eou__ I like people who are open and friendly . Those people are usually more active and fun to be with . I like spending time with my friends . We go to bars together or play sports together . __eou__ I don ’ t like to make friends with people who aren ’ t honest . Honesty is very important to me . __eou__ I think it ’ s important to most people . The problem is that you can usually only find out if someone is honest by getting to know them . __eou__ you can find out from their friends . __eou__ if you know any of their friends . You can ’ t rely on your friends to introduce people to you all the time . You have to go out and make the first move sometimes . I also like funny people . __eou__ oh , I don ’ t . they don ’ t seem to take anything seriously . You never know when they are joking and when they are being serious . __eou__ sometimes it can be hard to tell , but if you know the person fairly well , you can usually see from their expression what they are really thinking . __eou__ it seems that we generally like different kinds of people . How is it that we are such good friends ? __eou__ maybe people don ’ t like to have friends that are all the same . Most people like a little variety in their lives-including a variety of characteristics in their friends . __eou__
Where do you want to go this weekend ? __eou__ Let's go to the lake and camp on the south side . __eou__ Do you want to take the jet ski ? __eou__ Let's just rent one this time . The AC is broken in the truck , remember ? __eou__ Oh , that's right . Renting is good ! __eou__ Should we call the Olsen's and ask them if they want to join us ? __eou__ Okay , you call them . __eou__ Then you go out to the garage and check out the camping gear . __eou__
How about your grades of study ? __eou__ I had been doing quite well . In all subjects , I got excellent scores . __eou__ Well . In that case , you must have got good records in English , too . __eou__ Yes , I was the top student among my classmates . __eou__ How about your oral English ? __eou__ Quite well . I took the National English Speaking Contest in CCTV 2008 and I got first place . __eou__
Did you put this morning's faxes on my desk ? I'm waiting for some urgent faxes from headquarters , I'm pretty sure they came in last night . __eou__ Everything that came in off the fax machine last night is all on your desk . But I noticed that some of the faxes came through pretty blurred . Maybe you can take a look at them . If the copy is unreadable , I'll call them and ask them to relax . __eou__ Yeah , you're going to have to call them and get them to be re-faxed . These copies are so dark , I can't make out any of the words . __eou__ What about that one ? __eou__ This one ? This one is so light I can barely read it . How can that be ? __eou__ You know , I think the fax machine is out of toner , I can change the toner cartridge . That should solve the problem . __eou__ Yes , but this one will have to be re-faxed as well . And look , there's about three pages missing ! It looks loke the fax machine ate half my important faxes , and the ones that made it through are so blurred or too light , they're unreadable ! __eou__ I guess the fax machine is out of paper , too . Don't worry , I'll have someone look at it this afternoon , and in the meantime , I'll have your documents re-faxed to our other fax machine . __eou__
I'm hungry . Let's go to the snack bar . __eou__ ok , what unusual food do you want to try ? __eou__ I am going to try Gado Gado . __eou__ what's that ? __eou__ it's a kind of rice ball that is made in Malaysia . What about you ? __eou__ I don't know . I don't know what most of this food is ! __eou__ do you want noodles , vegetables , rice , meat , seafood , beans , or dessert ? __eou__ I'd like to have some vegetables first . __eou__ have you ever tried tempura ? __eou__ no , what is it ? __eou__ it's deep fried vegetables , which is commonly eaten in Japan . __eou__ what do you use to eat it ? __eou__ most people eat tempura with chopsticks , but you can use a fork if you don't know how to use chopsticks . __eou__ that sounds great . Do you know if there are any vegetable dishes that are spicy ? __eou__ let me think . You could get an Indian or Thai vegetable curry , or you could get some Kimchi . __eou__ I'll try all of those . How do you know so much about International food ? __eou__ I used to buy lunch every day from the International food stall at school . Every day was an adventure ! __eou__
Hi , Jenny . You look like you are in a hurry to somewhere . Where are you going ? __eou__ I am going to the bank . I need to cash some checks . __eou__ That's great . We can go to the bank together . __eou__ Why are you going there ? __eou__ I will go to Japan on business for 5 days next Tuesday . I want to exchange some Japanese yen . __eou__ I see . Will you bring a lot of money with you ? __eou__ Not really . I plan to bring some cash and withdraw money at the ATM in Japan . __eou__ Do you have the bank card in Japan ? __eou__ Nope . You can use the credit card to withdraw the money in foreign countries . __eou__ That sounds really convenient . Do you pay extra money to enjoy this service ? __eou__ No . It is free of charge . __eou__ Great ! I will apply for a credit card when I go to the bank later . __eou__ I think we are running out of time . The bank is going to close soon . __eou__
So it is hard to be a black student on campus ? __eou__ Yes , in many ways it is . There are many stereotypes I have to deal with in my daily life . __eou__ Stereotypes ? Like what ? __eou__ Well , like since I'm black , I must like rap music , come from the inner city , or play basketball well . __eou__ I do know you like rap music , but the other two are definitely false . I ’ Ve seen you play basketball . __eou__ Hey ! But that's not the only problem . There's also the affirmative action stigma . __eou__ You mean that people look down upon you because they think you're in school because of a quota ? That's not true at all , you're really a smart guy . __eou__ I know that , but some people don't think like that . And I get problems from teachers as well . __eou__ Teachers ? I didn't think that they would be racist at all . __eou__ Racist ? Not exactly . It's how they look at me and ask for my opinion on a topic , as if I can speak for all black people and give them the black opinion on a subject . Suddenly I become the representative of the black race , as if we all had the same opinion . __eou__ I see . It looks like there are still a lot of issues we need to work on in the US . __eou__
do you mind if I sit here ? __eou__ no , of course not . Go ahead . __eou__ don't I know you ? __eou__ yes , now that you mention it , I think we had a chemistry class together in high school . __eou__ you're right ! How are you ? It's been a long time ! __eou__ What did you do after high school ? __eou__ I went straight to university afterwards . What about you ? __eou__ I took a year off to go travelling . __eou__ that sounds exciting . Where did you go ? __eou__ I went all over the world . It was the best year of my life . Where did you go to school ? __eou__ I went to a small school in Connecticut . It has a very good reputation for its languages department . __eou__ Oh , did you study a foreign language ? __eou__ yes , I got a grant to study Chinese . __eou__ that's a very difficult language to learn , isn't it ? __eou__ it is , but it's very rewarding . __eou__ so you can speak Chinese ? __eou__ I can , but not as well as I'd like to . I'll be studying Chinese until the day I die ! __eou__ I think most languages take a lifetime to learn well . __eou__
I hope the food here is good . __eou__ Yes , it is very expensive . Maybe we shouldn't have come here . __eou__ But the guidebook says a lot of the stars come here.If we are spending three days in Hollywood , I want to see at least one star . __eou__ I think we might not see any . __eou__ Did you like the tour of Universal Studios ? __eou__ I thought it was O . K . But it really was too hot.And I think they should show people more . The exhibits should be more interesting . __eou__ I thought it was great . Didn't you like the special effects rooms ? __eou__ Yes , but I still think it could be better . __eou__
Where are you employed ? __eou__ I have been employed as a secretary at a trading company . __eou__ What do you think of your present job ? __eou__ I find it interesting . __eou__ How do you get to office ? __eou__ I go to the office by bus every day . __eou__ What does your work consist of exactly ? __eou__ My main responsibility is trouble-shooting between top management and the general employees . __eou__ Would you mind working overtime at night ? __eou__ No , often my boss requires overtime work . __eou__ How much money are you making a month ? __eou__ 5,000 yuan a month . __eou__ Why do you plan to change your job ? __eou__ I would like to have a job that is more lively than my present one . Besides , I would like to practise my English in my work . As my present employer deals with China trade towards China only , there isn ’ t much chance to speak English . __eou__
Jack , I don't know how to write my resume . Could you tell me about that ? __eou__ You should first write your name and contact information . __eou__ What does the contact information include ? __eou__ Such as your land line phone number , mobile phone number and e-mail box . __eou__ Anything else ? __eou__ Then you should write your objectives , such as seeking a position in foreign trade . __eou__ I see . It is the position desired __eou__ Yes . After that you should emphasize your skills , educational background and related experience . __eou__ I see . Skills are about specialty , and educational background is easy as well . But what about related experience ? I have little work experience . __eou__ Don't worry . It will take time to accumulate experience . You need to be confident for yourself . __eou__ I see . By the way , should I write the educational background starting from elementary school ? __eou__ Generally from the college __eou__ Thank you very much . I will write it right now . __eou__
I really think if I can get my foot in the door at this company it will do wonders for my career . Do you think you can help me polish my interview style ? __eou__ Sure . Doing your homework and preparing for an interview really pays off . __eou__ I ’ Ve researched the company and think I ’ m perfect for the job but I ’ m not sure how to get it across to them . __eou__ Well first you have to have more confidence.Employers look for people who are interested , enthusiastic and sure of themselves . __eou__ I know I have what it takes but Im worried that my work experience won ’ t sufficient . Should I inflate my experience ? __eou__ No , you should always be upfront and honest about your weaknesses . However by focusing on your strong points and maintaining a positive attitude about your abilities , you can take the attention __eou__

That is , if my credit rating is satisfactory . __eou__ Your credit is fine , Sir .

When did you decide this ? __eou__ I always knew she was the one , but I decided to pop the big question about 2 weeks ago . I'm just debating on how to do it . __eou__ That's exciting , man . __eou__ So how did you propose ? __eou__ You shouldn't use my example . It wasn't special . I kind of wish I made it more special but it's too late now . __eou__ What do you think I should do ? __eou__ There are a lot of options . You can surprise her over dinner , or ask her in a public area , or if you have the balls , ask her father in front of her . __eou__ I never thought about that . __eou__ Thought about what ? __eou__ Asking her father in front of her . How do you think she will react ? __eou__ I don't know . You should know how she's going to react . She is your girlfriend . __eou__ I think that's the idea I was looking for . Thanks , man . __eou__ Don't mention it . Good luck . You're going to need it . __eou__
I hear scientists in the US have discovered a new AIDS vaccine . __eou__ Does it work ? __eou__ I don ’ t know . The report says it is better than the old vaccines . __eou__ Don ’ t count on it . I think the best way to prevent AIDS is to keep yourself clean by having clean sex and keeping a regular sex partner . __eou__ Right . That ’ s why doctor say AIDS prevention means cleanness . __eou__
So how long have you know Jack ? __eou__ We go way back.We ' Ve known each other since we were toddlers . __eou__ Really ?

But now , you can see supermarkets , shopping malls and department stores everywhere . __eou__ Yeah , they are my wife's heaven , but not mine . I always get lost in the supermarket . __eou__ Me too ! I was lost three times ten years ago . There were no English directions then . __eou__ Is that better now ? __eou__ Yeah , there are many English signs , and wrong spellings as many as them . __eou__

Welcome to Game World . What can I do for you ? __eou__ I'd like to get a good RPG . Can you recommend any ? __eou__ Sure . This one here just came out . It's got great 3D graphics and a cool story line . It's also got a multiplayer function so you can play against other people on the Internet . __eou__ This one looks pretty good , but I'd like to see more before I make up my mind . Do you have any other suggestions ? __eou__ This one is also really cool . It's a sci-fi game in which you have to stop an alien invasion . The graphics on this one are spectacular . __eou__ Hmm , it's a tough choice , but I think I'll go with this one . __eou__
Can you hold the end of this tape measure ? __eou__ Sure . What's this for ? __eou__ I ' m taking some measurements for new curtains . __eou__ What about measuring the floor for a new carpet , and the walls for new wallpaper ? __eou__ I thought we'll just fix up the wood floor.and use some paint for the walls . __eou__ Good idea . I was thinking the same myself . __eou__ Tomorrow we'll go and pick out some curtains and paint . __eou__
My boss wore a real stupid tie to work today . Can you guess why ? __eou__ He isn't a man of good taste for clothes , is he ? __eou__ He is , but I didn't mean that . His daughter bought him a tie as a Father's Day gift , and he was very happy to wear it and show it off to us in the office . __eou__ It must be hard being a father . __eou__ No , it's great being a father , seeing your children growing up and loving you and admiring you . __eou__ Maybe you'll only feel that way on Father's Day . __eou__
That's good to know . We'll watch for crazy drivers . __eou__ Hey , guys . Ready for a pick-up game of touch football ? __eou__ Football ? Sounds dangerous . Maybe I'll just be a cheerleader . __eou__ C'mon , Yi-jun . It's lots of fun . You've seen football played on TV . __eou__ Uh , yeah . And I've seen guys in pads tackled . We have no pads . I don't want to be tackled . __eou__ There's barely any contact in touch football . People just tag you to stop the play . __eou__ OK , but they better tag lightly ! __eou__
Are you doing the football pools , Brian ? __eou__ Yes , I ’ Ve nearly finished , June . I ’ m sure we will win something this week . __eou__ You always say that , but we never win anything !

Maybe I'll start to look for my girl when I achieve success . __eou__ Why is that ? __eou__ Because I'm living a real world , a man enriched have a good career and make a lot of money . Franklin speaking the girls I've met wounldn't married a man wounldn't make enough money . __eou__ I agree , a man needs good career.But that doesn't mean he should have a little fun , too . __eou__

Hey , Michael . Remember me ? I'm Becky . We used to work at Lemans together . __eou__ Oh , sure . How are you ? Long time no see . How are things at Lemans ? __eou__ It's about the same . I've been thinking of making a change myself . Do you mind if I ask you a few things about your job at the university ? __eou__ No , not at all . Go ahead . __eou__ Well , I was wondering what the salaries are like ? I mean ... are they much lower than the corporate world ? __eou__ Well , I can't speak for all universities , but my salary is a definitely lower than at Lemans . I just don't think the salaries are comparable when you leave a major corporation . __eou__ Yeah , that's what I thought . But , I've heard that the perks are better . I was wondering if that was really true . __eou__ I'd have to say yes and no on that . I don't get a big end-of-the-year bonus like I did at Lemans but I get to take classes for free if I want to . I've always wanted to get a graduate degree so I'm taking classes now to do that . __eou__ Oh , that's great . It sounds like you're really happy with your move . __eou__ Yeah , I guess I am . Working at a university is really suits me . __eou__
Couldn't you extend the delivery period by two weeks ? That would make things much easier for us . __eou__ Well , you know the time of shipment means a lot to us . __eou__ I can understand , but our company is fully committed at the moment , and hundreds of clients are placing orders for delivery these days . __eou__ I see.OK , that's agreed then . __eou__
Jack ! You've really done it this time . __eou__ What ?

What am I going to do with you ? __eou__ Please , give me one more chance . I'll never let it happen again . I'm very sorry . __eou__ Well , I guess I could give you one more chance , but this is the last time.In themeantime , I hear that Tom who normally does night shift is taking three weeks ' vacation , Can you think of anyone who would be willing to work nights while he is gone ? __eou__ Um , me ? __eou__ Bingo ! __eou__

I have no choice . __eou__
Let's start out to discuss the question of payment terms . __eou__ I suppose you know very well that we require irrevocable letters of credit payable against presentation of shipping documents . __eou__ I fully understand your position . An irrevocable letter of credit ensures that the seller gets paid in time . But , on the other hand it would add to the buying costs . We've been , after all , trading partners for 3 years and you know us well . Can't you give us D / A or D / P ? __eou__ I'm afraid it has been our practice so far to insist on payment by L / C . __eou__ But on our part , our government is reluctant to approve of L / C payment for our imports . And there is the licensing problem . __eou__ I understand that . Still , I'm not in a position to help you . Maybe we could do something later when we have had more and larger deals together . __eou__

Your products would sell very well here . We are prepared to do more business with you . We are also interested in handing a sole agent for you . __eou__ We really appreciate your efforts . Before we go to the core of matter , can you give us some idea of them on which you would be willing to operate as our agent ? __eou__ No problem . __eou__

Do you have a reservation ? __eou__ No , we don't . __eou__ How many people are you together ? __eou__ Just two people . __eou__ Would you like to sit in a smoking section , a non-smoking section or whatever comes open first ? __eou__ We prefer non-smoking section . __eou__ I am awfully sorry but there are no vacancies left now . Would you like to wait for a moment ? __eou__ How long a wait do you think there ’ ll be ? __eou__ I think about ten minutes . __eou__ Ok , we'll wait a while . __eou__ I am sorry for making you wait so long . Now there is a table available in non-smoking section . Please follow me . __eou__ Thank you . __eou__ This is the menu . Are you ready to order now ? __eou__ Well , I think I'd like to have a tomato sausage soup first . And the same for him , please . __eou__ Yes , and what would you like to drink ? __eou__ One goblet of red wine and one bottle of beer please . __eou__ Would you like a dessert ? __eou__ What special kind of desserts do you have ? __eou__ Lemon pie , hot cake in syrup , chocolate sundae and custard pudding . __eou__ Well , I think we will order after we finish the main course . __eou__ All right . I'll bring your soup right away . __eou__

are you looking for a course ? __eou__ yes , but I'm not sure which one to sign up for . __eou__ what kind of program are you looking for ? Full-time or part-time ? __eou__ I have to work during the day , so I want to find a part-time course that I can do in the evenings . __eou__ what kind of course are you looking for ? __eou__ I need to improve my English . __eou__ do you want a one-to-one private tutor or a group class ? __eou__ I think a one-to-one course will be too expensive for me , so a group class would be fine . __eou__ have you ever considered taking one of our online courses ? __eou__ I think I prefer face-to-face instruction better . __eou__ that's fine . If you want , you can sign up for a pre-sessional interview . __eou__ what's that for ? __eou__ one of our qualified teachers will interview you so that they can find a class that suits you best . __eou__ do you have a brochure about the course that I can take home to read ? __eou__ sure .

Perhaps I picked it up there . __eou__ Did you take any cold medication ? __eou__ I ’ Ve been taking vitamin C and zinc and trying to get some rest . __eou__ I think that rest and liquids are what doctors recommend for a cold . __eou__ My grandmother swears by hot chicken soup for a cold . __eou__ A pharmacist might be able to help you if your home remedies don ’ t work . __eou__ Yes , if I get worse , I will definitely look for extra help with this . __eou__
I'm afraid it's a bad news for you . There are some problems in your supervised goods . __eou__ Oh , no ! How did this happen . Are you sure ? __eou__ I overheard this information when I passed Arden's office . We got some complaints from consumers yesterday . I am terribly sorry for that . __eou__ My God ! I actually checked them one by one . How could this be ? __eou__ Calm down ! It is useless to act like that . Can we find some solutions ? __eou__ What kind of solution can I have now ? I nearly go crazy now . __eou__ But we still have to find one . Can we find Arden to check whether this is true or not ? __eou__ It seems that I have nothing to do , except this . __eou__ Face the reality . Maybe we can find the way to make up the loss . __eou__
We have successfully fulfilled our work plan . In fact , we are No . 1 in terms of market share . __eou__ You have gotten amazing success .

What can I do for you today ? __eou__ It's a little embarrassing really ; you see I think I've got a counterfeit note . __eou__ Do you remember where you got it ? __eou__ No , I don't .

So , unfortunately you'll lose this 50 RIB . We'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated . __eou__

Did someone tell you already ? __eou__ Yes . I overheard your mom and my mom talking in the grocery store . __eou__ I want to ride a camel and definitely see the pyramids ! __eou__ I wish our family took outrageous summer vacations like yours . __eou__ It helps that my dad is an archaeologist . __eou__ We'll get to go fishing at the river .

What are your terms of sale ? __eou__ The price quoted is for CIF . __eou__ My understanding is that CIF means the seller is responsible for prepaying shipping costs and arranging for the insurance policy . __eou__ Yes , that is correct . We will arrange for the shipping costs and insurance policy . __eou__ Is it possible to consider FOB ? That way , we will handle the insurance through our broker . __eou__ Yes , we could also make this arrangement , , if you prefer . __eou__
We've been waiting here for nearly ten minutes now , and there still isn't a bus in sight . __eou__ I'm afraid we'll be late for the party . __eou__ Have you got the time , Tom ? __eou__ Yes , my watch says a quarter to seven . but there is something wrong with my watch ! __eou__ But you bought it only last month . __eou__ Yes , but ever since I bought it , it gains about five minutes a day , so I ' Ve got to have it repaired . __eou__ How long will it take us to get there ? __eou__ I think about ten minutes by bus . __eou__ It's not far away , then . Let's walk , it's beginning to rain . __eou__ Wait ! I think I see a bus coming now . Let's hope it's the No . 22 bus . __eou__
We're forming a study group to prepare for the finals . Do you want to join us ? __eou__ But the semester just started ? Why the rush ? __eou__ After you try it once this way , I don't think you'll ever put off studying till the end again . __eou__ How often do you meet ? __eou__ We plan to get together once a week . __eou__ What days , do you know ? __eou__ We were talking about Wednesday evenings at the library , from seven to eight . __eou__ Okay , count me in . __eou__

Excuse me . Is there any body here ? __eou__ Yes . __eou__ I've finished up all my water . I would kill for a sip of water . __eou__ Sure , come on in . __eou__ Thank you very much . Are you here alone ? __eou__ My father and sister are out to photographing . What about you ? __eou__ I'm a back-packer from America . __eou__ What is a back-packer ? __eou__ It means a hiker who loves traveling around the world . __eou__ Cool . You must have been to a lot of places . __eou__ Yes , actually almost half of all the countries over the world . I love traveling places . __eou__ So cool . I want to be a back-packer when I grow up . __eou__ You can do it . But do work hard on your English to make it easier . __eou__ I'll try my best . __eou__
Those guys thought they would never lose . But we finally beat them . And look at them crying now . __eou__ The bigger they are , the harder they fall . __eou__
Look , George , There's the Great Wall . __eou__ I see . It's on top of the hills . __eou__ Yeah , it stretches over for thousands of miles . __eou__ I know . It's a major symbol of China . __eou__ Where can we climb it ? __eou__ Do we have any choices ? __eou__ Well , we could take the cable car . __eou__ Ah ... let's just climb . It's more fun , I think . __eou__ Okay . Let's go . __eou__ Well , that was tough . __eou__ But we made it . __eou__ This looks great . When was it built ? __eou__ It was first built about twenty-five hundred years ago . __eou__ That's remarkable . __eou__ There are so many ancient relics in China . __eou__
My mother bought me a new video game . __eou__ What's it like ? __eou__ Well , the hero is a Super Warrior . He has to fight the bad guys to find the treasure . __eou__ Who are the bad guys ? __eou__ There are a lot ! Two really bad ones are Giant Monster and Human Spider . __eou__ Wow ! Where's the treasure ? __eou__ It's in a dungeon , under a castle . __eou__ How do you find it ? __eou__ It's not easy to find . Anyway , you can come to my home after school today and try . __eou__ Great ! __eou__
The portions here are man sized . We usually end up taking half of the meal home with us . __eou__ Everything looks so good . Is there anything in particular that you recommend ? __eou__ Hey , sis . You know me , if I don't like everything on the menu , I don't go back to the restaurant ! __eou__ So you're saying I can't go wrong with anything I order ? In that case ... __eou__ Wait , you love salmon , don't you ? They have the best salmon pasta . __eou__ That sounds really good ! Does it come with a soup ? __eou__ Soup and bread and salad bar ! I'm telling you , these people know how to keep you coming back ! __eou__ I see what you mean ! __eou__
Can your dog do any tricks ? __eou__ Sure he can . He can shake hands , roll over , and even play dead . __eou__ I wish I had a dog . My cat can't do any tricks . __eou__ Yeah , but sometimes Bingo wants to play with me , but I don't have time . __eou__ So who takes care of him then ? __eou__ My little brother likes to play with him . He even gives him a bath every week . __eou__ I can't do that with my cat . She hates water . __eou__ You know , you're right . Maybe you should get a dog . __eou__
Now I'm sure we'll never get all our things back . They're so clever these criminals . What's the point of collecting beautiful things for other people to steal ? __eou__ I only wish it were this time yesterday . __eou__ Think how happy we were . Now this.Things always go wrong . __eou__ Perhaps we ought to get dressed and have breakfast . We'd feel better . __eou__ I don't feel like breakfast . I don't feel like anything . Why are we so unlucky ? It's as if there were a jinx on us . __eou__ Perhaps I'd better ring the police ... __eou__ Yes . Of course . But what good will it do ? That man's miles away from here by now . In our car . __eou__
What's happening , officer ? __eou__ There is a fire in your building . You need to evacuate immediately . __eou__ What ? A fire ? Oh , my God ! What shall I do ? Please get me out of here ! __eou__ Don't panic ! We'll help you get out of the building safely . __eou__ I can smell smoke ! __eou__ Please follow my instructions . Use a wet towel to cover your mouth and nose . Walk quietly to th nearest emergency exit .

Johnny , have you tidied up your room yet ? __eou__ Not yet , Mom . Why are you on such a cleanliness kick anyway ? __eou__ Do I have to remind you that your grandma is arriving tonight ? __eou__ Oh , my God , I forgot grandma's coming ! __eou__ Yes , so this place had better be clean . You know Grandma ... __eou__ ... I know I'll be killed if I pee on the toilet seat . __eou__ And Steve is going to look after you until we come back . __eou__
Why didn't you text me last night ? __eou__ What ? I sent you three or four messages ! __eou__ I didn't get any of them . I was waiting for you to text me the address of where the party was and I never got your message . __eou__ Why didn't you just call ? I hate sending SMS messages . __eou__ Well , because I didn't have any credit on my phone . I used it all up this month . __eou__ I thought you had an unlimited SMS plan ? __eou__ I do , but if I don't have any credit in my phone , it won't let me call or send messages . __eou__ No wonder you didn't get my texts ! __eou__
Good morning , young lady . You can call me Ma . Do you see anything you like ? __eou__ Yes . Many things ! I especially love this beautiful quilt . __eou__ That quilt was passed down to me from my ma in Holland . __eou__ It sounds like a special quilt . Why do you want to sell it ? __eou__ Well , this home is too big for me now , so I'm moving to an apartment that is much smaller . Therefore , I need to part with a few things . __eou__ Oh , I see . Umm , how much do you want for the quilt ? __eou__ Is fifteen dollars OK ? __eou__
I'm glad you're on your ten-year reunion planning committee . __eou__ Yeah , you get the TV to yourself while I spend my nights surfing the Net for missing classmates . __eou__ That's not why . This way I can see how you guys do this sort of thing . __eou__ I guess . Don't you have reunions in Taiwan ? __eou__ Definitely . Every year . But just for our forty-person class . __eou__ Ours are for everyone that graduated in the same year . __eou__
Hi , Nally , are you hungry ? __eou__ I'm starving . Let's go grab a bite . __eou__ Where to ? __eou__ How about Karlis ? __eou__ Are you kidding ? That place is too ritzy for lunch . __eou__ True . ok Let's go to Grumose ? __eou__ Same thing , meals there all coarsen arm and leg . __eou__ I guess it is a little pricy . __eou__ Let's stop it at Multicolor for a quick lunch .. __eou__ That will be Ok . Come on , I can't wait to chow down . __eou__ That was a great lunch , the food was good , but the service was lousy . __eou__ Is that why you stiffed the waiter ? __eou__ You got it . All right , Let's go back to school . __eou__
School has added several new courses to our grade this semester . I have more homework to do now . __eou__ What's your favorite course , Daniel ? __eou__ I like science most . __eou__ Science ? That's a surprise . __eou__ Surprise ? __eou__ I thought you would like PE . __eou__ I do like PE , but I am interested in science . __eou__ Are you interested in science ? I can't believe it . __eou__ Through this course , I can learn more about the world around us clearly . __eou__ Your parents would be happy if they knew that . Because you are always a naughty boy . __eou__ Naughty ? I'm naughty ? I'm just clever . So I only do the things I am interested in . __eou__ Hope so . __eou__
Bob , put on your shoes , your feet are really smelly . __eou__ No foot gives out scent . __eou__ But don't forget you are in a cafe . __eou__ Never mind , the odour of my feet will quicken their eating speed . __eou__ I simply can't bear your barbaric behavior . __eou__ Don ’ t pretend you are a good God . __eou__ You should feel shameful for your behavior . __eou__ I've never experienced such a kind of feeling . __eou__ I'm really sick of you . __eou__
Alice , I never knew you had such a lovely voice . You really can sing , can't you ? __eou__ Thanks , Mark . I used to be a member of the school choir . __eou__ No wonder you can control your voice so well . You are a professional singer . __eou__ Well , you are flattering me . I wouldn't say I am a professional , but I did receive some training at school . My music teacher used to be a professional singer . __eou__ Well , a good teacher makes good students . __eou__ You are quite right . __eou__
Ugh . Another advertisement . They ’ Ve added two hours of advertisements to a two hours movie . __eou__ Yeah . We ’ re never going to get to the end of this one . __eou__ Why are we watching it anyway ? __eou__ Well , it does have a lot of girls in it . __eou__ True . True . __eou__ Do you think Bruce Willis just drank a Coke for his health ? __eou__ Really ? Did Coke pay him for that ? __eou__ Of course . __eou__ You want something to drink ? __eou__ Yeah , Got a Coke ? __eou__ Sure . __eou__ Hurry , the movie is coming back on . __eou__
I love your bracelet . When did you get it ? __eou__ I got it a while ago , but I haven't worn it much . You really like it ? __eou__ Yeah . It's beautiful . Is it white gold or silver ? __eou__ It's white gold . __eou__ Where did you buy it ? __eou__ My boyfriend took me to the Shane Co . and he let me pick it out . __eou__ That's so sweet . What was the occasion ? __eou__ That's the best part . It wasn't for anything special . He just wanted to buy me something . __eou__ You're so lucky . If he bought you something for no special day , I wonder what he would buy you for your birthday . __eou__ My birthday is coming up . We'll find out pretty soon . __eou__ What do you want ? __eou__ I wouldn't mind a necklace . I was at the jewelry shop looking around , and they have a couple of beautiful necklaces I want . __eou__ Why not a ring ? __eou__ I don't think I'm ready for a ring from him yet . __eou__ But you're ready for everything else ? __eou__ Akha . __eou__
For the 100th anniversary of the opening of the library we are going to have a party . __eou__ That's a wonderful way to celebrate this grand old library ! __eou__ I hoped you would be willing to brainstorm with me for party ideas . __eou__ That is right up my alley . You say party and I'm there . __eou__ Perfect . It will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about five to seven hundred people . __eou__ Will it be an all day event ? __eou__ Yes . And we checked with the city and we have permission to use the park adjacent to the library . __eou__ That was quick thinking . __eou__
William told you that his grandmother is sick , huh ? What exactly did he say ? __eou__ He said his grandmother got cancer and has only a few weeks to live . It's really so sad ! But when I talked to him on the phone , it sounded like he was holding up really well . __eou__ It didn't sound like he was too upset , huh ? What did you tell him ? __eou__ I asked if there was anything I could do to help his family , and I told him that I could be a shoulder for him to cry on . __eou__ Well I hate to tell you this Jen , but both of William's grandmothers passed away more than five years ago . __eou__
Hi , Mrs . Henderson . __eou__ Hi , Steven . Do you have time and chat with me ? __eou__ Of course I have plenty of time . What's new ? __eou__ The new couple next door divorced . Have you heard about it ? __eou__ No . The Hills ? Who filed for divorce first ? __eou__ I guess it Is Mrs Hill . She sued for divorce on the grounds of her husband's misconduct with his secretary . __eou__ Oh , maybe not . It's just your guess . Do not give currency to idle gossip . __eou__ OK . I close my mouth . __eou__
It seems to me that you are on very good terms with him . __eou__ We actually met at a dance party . He fell for me . __eou__ He must be all over you the first time he saw you . __eou__ He said that I put all other girls in the shade . __eou__ That means he was head over heels in love with you . __eou__ Well , he indeed likes me . __eou__ But I think he can't hold a candle to you . I don't think he has ever popped the question . __eou__ No , he is the sort of man who likes to hide his candle under a bushel . __eou__
Do you object to drinking black tea , Mr.Zhang ? __eou__ Yes , that is why I never drink it . __eou__ Do you drink green tea , then ? __eou__ Very seldom , because tea has tannin which may be harmful to one's health . __eou__ But if the tea is good and well prepared , it will do much good . __eou__ What good is it for ? __eou__ Not only can it appease one's thirst , but it can also refresh one when tired . __eou__ That's true , but it must not be allowed to stand long . __eou__ Why is it so ? __eou__ Because if you drink a kind of tea which has been prepared for some time before , it will do you harm . __eou__
Steven , why are you so depressed ? __eou__ I'm feeling very sad . I just read the newspaper . __eou__ What's the news ? __eou__ According to the newspaper , the town was razed by an earthquake and more than 10 thousand people died in the earthquake . __eou__ It's horrible . __eou__ Yeah , we have to do something to help the people in the stricken area . __eou__ Yes . How about donating some money ? __eou__ It's a good idea . But where can we donate money ? __eou__ Just find the answer through Internet . __eou__ Yes , let's do it now . __eou__
Don't be too sad . If you really think that you have no feeling with him , then , in my opinion , getting divorced maybe is the best way to solve the problem . __eou__ I know clearly at the bottom of my heart . I just can't set my mind at rest because of the child . She's little . She cannot understand us and accept such truth . __eou__ Yeah , child is the matter . Don't tell Jenny the truth , only tell her the white lie . When she grows up , you find the suitable opportunity to tell her . __eou__ I see . OK . __eou__
Guess who I saw yesterday ? __eou__ Who ? __eou__ My cousin Monk . Have you seen her lately ? __eou__ Not for a couple of years . What happened to her ? __eou__ Nothing exactly . She's grown into a very attractive young lady . __eou__ Oh , she is . __eou__ You know , her long lovely blond hair and beautiful blue eyes really make her stand out from others . __eou__ Not surprising .

Help me organize these coins . __eou__ That's a lot of money ! What did you do ? Break the piggy bank ? __eou__ Yeah , I'm gonna go to the bank and change it for bills , but first I have to separate them into little piles . __eou__ Ok , I'll find all the quarters and dimes while you sort the nickels and pennies . __eou__ Great , then we can add everything up and take it to the bank . __eou__ I found some coins that are not from here . __eou__ Oh yeah , those are from my trip to London .

Your boy Dean broke the silex yesterday , so I have to boil it in the pan . __eou__ It tastes like crankcase oil , but delicious . __eou__ That's good . You can make breakfast yourself if you don't like it . __eou__ What is there besides coffee ? __eou__ I warmed a couple of snails , and your eggs are in the frying pan . __eou__ Oh , my God . It's nearly eight , I have no time to have breakfast now . My watch says seven fifty . __eou__ Don't worry . It's only ten to seven . You must have forgotten to set your watch back . __eou__ Yes , it was . The clock on the wall says eight to seven . __eou__ Yeah . Keep on eating your breakfast . You can catch the early bus . __eou__ Gee . I could have slept another hour . __eou__
Excuse me . How much for one are these ? __eou__ Un .. Those are 25 dollars each . __eou__ OK .

Like four for 75 dollars . __eou__ This one I'd better chat with the manager . Could you give me a second ? __eou__
Is the lake very polluted ? __eou__ Well , I wouldn't swim in it - but the water is much cleaner than it was a few years ago . __eou__ Are local factories allowed to discharge waste water into the lake ? __eou__ Yes , but it must be treated in an effluent treatment plant first . __eou__
It seems to me that everything is going digital nowadays . __eou__ Yes . Speaking of digital wares , I bought a digital camera last week . __eou__ Cool ! What brand __eou__ A Sony .

It's a 4 megapixel one and the photos it takes are very vivid and clear . __eou__
My elder aunt feels like vomiting , she is pregnant . __eou__ She'd better drink plenty of hot water and lie in bed . __eou__ But she feels like having no appetite at all if she stays at home all day . __eou__ Don't worry . She will be all right . __eou__

A twist of fate brought us together . I crashed into your life and you into mine , and this may sound crazy , but I ’ m falling in love with you , Veronica . __eou__

But the repeat order can't have the same terms . __eou__

Hi , good to see you . What can we assist you with today ? Going away on business again ? __eou__ Yes , I'm off again at the beginning of next week . I need to get some Traveller's Cheques . __eou__ We do always recommend people take Traveller's Cheques when travelling overseas . The world is a dangerous place nowadays , you never know . __eou__ Sure . At least if I do get robbed , heaven forbid , I can get my money back using the traveller's cheques insurance . Once , when I was travelling in France , I was pick-pocketed and not only did you replace my Traveller's Cheques for free , you also did it extremely quickly and easily . __eou__
The weather is terrible . __eou__ Yeah . It's been raining a lot these days . __eou__ I have been watching a lot of videos at home because of the constant rain . __eou__ Have you heard when it's supposed to get better ? __eou__ I saw the weather report , and it's going to rain for the next eight days . __eou__ That sucks so much .

The rain can start up again anytime . __eou__
What ’ s your favourite ball sport ? __eou__ I like basketball . I really enjoy watching the NBA games on TV . __eou__ Who ’ s your favourite player ? __eou__ I don ’ t really have one but I support Huston . __eou__ Do they have a good team ? __eou__ I think they do , but I ’ m biased . They have a good manager and a great coach . __eou__ I can ’ t keep up with the game . The players play so quickly that I can hardly see what they are doing . __eou__ I have the same problem . The players are really very skilful . I wish I could play that well . __eou__ You play for an amateur team , don ’ t you ? __eou__ Yes , I do . We ’ re doing pretty well this season . We ’ Ve won most of our games , but we ’ re not top of the league table . __eou__ How many more games are there this season ? __eou__ We ’ Ve got four more games . I hope we can win all of them . __eou__
Hey Michelle . Good to see you . Are you at lunch ? __eou__ Oh hi Jim . No I just got back . I thought you were on vacation now . __eou__ No , I wish I was ! I just got back from Spain actually . __eou__ Oh wonderful ! Have you been there before or was it your first time ? __eou__ My first time . I've traveled around Europe a lot , but this was my first time to Spain . It was amazing , and the weather was just beautiful ! No rain , and just sun , sun , sun ... __eou__ I'm so jealous of you . I've never been anywhere in Europe . I've always dreamed of traveling around and seeing the sights . __eou__ Well , I really recommend Spain . You really should go . Anyway , it's been great to catch up , but I must be going , this is my floor . Speak again soon I hope . __eou__
I never understand why these shops have so much liquor . __eou__ What do you mean ? It's because it's much cheaper to buy liquor duty-free . __eou__ But why ? Why don't people like to buy shirts duty-free ? Or shoes ? I just don't understand why it's always liquor . __eou__ Well , it's because in most countries liquor has a higher tax on it . __eou__ You mean liquor has a higher tax than other things ? __eou__ Yes , of course . Didn't you know that ? __eou__ No , I didn't . How high is the tax ? __eou__ Well , it is different in different countries.But it's because of the high tax that buying liquor duty-free is such a good deal . __eou__ Why would the government want to tax liquor so much ? __eou__ Liquor is considered a luxury item.And also , it is considered as something that isn't very healthy.So if people want to buy it , the government thinks it has the right to tax it . __eou__ That's why a lot of people buy cigarettes here too , isn't it ? __eou__ Of course . Cigarettes are also taxed very heavily . __eou__
so , which sport do you prefer---basketball or baseball ? __eou__ to be honest , I don't really care for either one . __eou__ I thought everyone liked basketball . Why don't you like it ? __eou__ I used to play basketball when I was little , and I never scored a goal . Every time I watch a basketball game , I think about how horrible I was at it . __eou__ that makes sense . __eou__ how about you ? What's your favorite sport of all time ? __eou__ my absolute favorite is ice hockey . __eou__ have you ever seen a live game ? __eou__ sure , many times . It's an exciting game for spectators to watch . __eou__ I've never really understood the game . __eou__ it's not that difficult . If you want to watch a game with me , I can explain the rules and the tactics while we're watching . __eou__ thanks , that'd be nice . When's the next ice hockey game on ? __eou__ not for a while , but we could watch an old one on the internet so I can explain the game to you . __eou__ that's a good idea . __eou__ let's watch the Canadian team . They have a good manager and a great coach . __eou__
Here's some flowers , love . Happy Valentine's Day . __eou__ Those are beautiful . They smell lovely . Thank you . __eou__ This is let you know that I still you after all this years . I knew there are some up and down when I married you , but through at all , you've always been may my Valentine . __eou__ Oh , sweet . You've always been my love too . __eou__ I don't think I say this enough , but I want to thank you for your kind listen patience , you ' Ve always been there for me . __eou__ I'll do everything for you , love . You know that , maybe you didn't realize , but you made everyday a enjoys moment and happy occasion . __eou__ I am so glad we met one another . __eou__
Daddy , do you mind helping me prepare the supplies for mountain climbing . __eou__ OK . I am coming . __eou__ Is it gonna to rain tomorrow ? __eou__ I have checked the weather report . It says it will be cloudy , but no rain . __eou__ Just take my umbrella in case of rain . __eou__ Daniel , don't forget to take enough water and food . __eou__ Definitely , or else , I will starve to death halfway up the mountain . __eou__ Me , too , haha . __eou__ Daddy , may I take your compass ? I feel so cool with it in my hand . __eou__ All right . Oh , I nearly forgotten , I left my sneakers at my office . __eou__ It doesn't matter . I can go with you to the supermarket to pick up a new pair . __eou__ OK , after we finish our preparation , we'll go to the supermarket . __eou__
I'll be willing to come and talk about the financing of our imports . __eou__ It can be solved by drawing a draft on us at 90 days sight . __eou__ What about a draft at 120 days sight ? __eou__ All right . But we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us . __eou__ A bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports . You can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due . __eou__ Then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank . You know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible . __eou__ I hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries . __eou__ So do I . __eou__
Mr . Drake , I'm pleased to do business with your company . __eou__ We're glad to be able to offer our services to your business , Mrs . Wayne . __eou__ Your company is very well respected . About how long have you been in business ? __eou__ Almost twenty years . We were the first total PR services company of our kind in California . __eou__ And this is your company's head office ? __eou__ Well , yes , but now we have six offices in California alone . __eou__ That's wonderful . Isn't your company part of ARE Corporation ? __eou__ That's right . We are their sole PR sector business . __eou__ That's not bad . How long have you been in PR ? __eou__ Not long actually . So I'm sure I will learn a lot from our cooperation . __eou__
What is the proper way to sit at a dinner table ? __eou__ Ideal posture is to sit straight , but not stiff , against the back of the chair . __eou__ Yes . __eou__ Hands , when one is not actually eating , may be in the lap . Tipping one's chair is unforgivable . __eou__
I think I found my Yankee's mug ... __eou__ Oh , great . Where was it ? __eou__ It fell out of the garbage bag . __eou__ What was it doing there ? __eou__ It was with all the other dishes from dinner . __eou__ You mean Johnny threw out all the dinnerware ? __eou__ I think our son was trying to pull a fast one on us . __eou__
I used to think that Americans had so much money they didn ’ t know what to do with it . __eou__ You did ? __eou__ Yes . But now I ’ Ve learned differently . Now I have a more realistic opinion . __eou__ What do you think now ? __eou__ There are lots of jobs , and almost everybody works . There is a high standard of living . People earn a lot , but they spend a lot to live . So there isn ’ t so much money after all . __eou__ But I still say Americans spend a lot more money on useless things than we Chinese do . __eou__ That ’ s true . But Americans work hard for their money like we do . I don ’ t know why our spending habits are so different . __eou__
Do you know that the dolphin is the most intelligent animal in the world ? __eou__ Yes . Dolphins have a big brain and they are very smart . They are also the fastest swimmers in the world . __eou__ They must be amazing animals . __eou__ They are . I read a story about a dolphin saving a A from drowning in the sea . __eou__ I read that story too . They seem to be able to understand men . __eou__ They sure can . Maybe they can interact with men better than monkeys and apes . __eou__
I heard you are going to move . __eou__ Yes , I found a better house near my office . I ’ m very satisfied with it . But I ’ m worrying . __eou__ What are you worried about ? __eou__ I ’ m worrying about how to move all of my household stuff . You know , I have a lot of stuff . __eou__ You can call a mover . __eou__ How much dose that cost ? __eou__ Around 200 RIB for a truck . __eou__ I think it ’ s a little expensive . __eou__ But think about it , you just need to pack your stuff and leave everything for the movers , how much trouble you will save . __eou__ That ’ s right . __eou__ I know a mover which has a very good reputation for their service . I ’ ll leave you their phone number . __eou__ Wonderful . __eou__ It ’ s 8357688 8 . __eou__ Okay , thanks a lot . You did me a great favor just now . __eou__ You ’ re welcome . __eou__
Our company's wei-ya is tomorrow night ! It's your first Chinese New Year in Taiwan--you must be excited ! __eou__ Excited ? What's there to be excited about ? It's just another company dinner , right ? __eou__ You have no idea ! There's a banquet with prizes , performances ... you name it ! __eou__ Really ? What kind of prizes ? __eou__ Well , I heard that last year Vivian from accounting won a new car ! __eou__ A new car ! You're kidding ! __eou__ No , really ! And she told me the secret to winning , wear red underwear ! __eou__ Wear red underwear ? ! Does that really work ? Are you going to try it ? __eou__ Of course ! I'm not only going to wear red underwear , but I'm going to wear red socks and a red shirt , too ! __eou__ Gee , I don't think I own any red underwear , but I can buy some ! __eou__
When the rain stops , you ’ ll see how beautiful the beach is . __eou__ But the rain has been pouring down for two days . We ’ Ve both caught colds . __eou__ And this bedroom is too big and damp . But it ’ s better than a tent . __eou__ How unlucky ! Let ’ s pack our bags and go home . __eou__
How many places have you worked altogether ? __eou__ Three . __eou__ Would you tell me the general description of your present job ? __eou__ I am in charge of the trading department . I'm handling invoices , shipping bills and computing freight costs , that's most of the documentation . __eou__ What time do you go to work ? __eou__ I must be there no later than 9:00 . __eou__ What time does the office close ? __eou__ I quit work whenever I get finished , usually about six o'clock . __eou__ Does your work involve a lot of paper filling and typing ? __eou__ No , the secretary does this . It's not part of my job . __eou__ What made you decide to change your job ? __eou__ I am working in a small company where further promotion is impossible , so I decided to change my job . I'd like to find a job which is more challenging . __eou__
Good afternoon , Sir . You're here to see about a Temporary Loan , right ? The loans we offer are for purchasing income-generating assets . Is that what you require ? __eou__ Yes , that's exactly what I need . How about terms for these ? __eou__ Well , we offer 60 - day or 90 - day loans . The balance of the loan is to be repaid in full by the end of the specified period . __eou__ Is there any flexibility on that ? __eou__ Unfortunately , not . __eou__ OK . In my position , I think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan . That would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan . __eou__ Not a problem , Sir . If you'd just fill out these forms , and of course with necessary clearance , we can get you the money right away . __eou__
Could you do something to advance your time of shipment ? __eou__ Well , our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment . I'm afraid it's very difficult to improve any further on the time . __eou__ I hope you'll try to convince them to step up production . __eou__ We check their production schedule against our orders almost every day . As new orders keep coming in , they are working three shifts to step up production . I'm sorry , but we simply cannot commit ourselves beyond what the production schedule can fulfill . __eou__ Well , in that case , there is nothing more to be said . What's your last word as to the date then ? __eou__ I said by the middle of October . This is the best we can promise . __eou__ All right . I'll take you at your word . May I suggest that you put down in the contract shipment on October 15th or earlier ? Our letter of credit will be opened early September . __eou__ Good . Let's call it a deal . We'll do our best to advance the shipment to September . The chances are that some of the other orders may be cancelled . But of course you cannot count on that . In any case , we'll let you know by email . __eou__ That's very considerate of you . And now , shall we discuss the insurance terms ? __eou__ We generally insure W . P . ( W . P . A ) on a C . I . F . offer . Special risks , such as TEND ( Theft , Pilferage and Non-delivery ) , leakage , breakage , oil , freshwater , etc . can also be covered upon request . __eou__ I suppose the additional premium for the special coverage is for the buyer's account . __eou__ Quite right . According to the usual practice in international trade , special risks are not covered unless the buyer asks for them . __eou__ Then what about SICC ( Strikes , Riots and Civil Commotions ) ? Can we request you to cover this for our imports ? __eou__ Yes , we accept it now , after it has been suspended for many years . However , if you want to have it covered for your imports at your end , you may arrange the insurance as you like . __eou__ Then please cover W . P . A . and TEND for this transaction . __eou__ All right , I'll adjust the price accordingly . __eou__
I think you made the right choice , coming to us.We have a wide selection of vehicles you can choose from . __eou__ I would like to rent a car with a good stereo . __eou__ All our cars have stereos in them.Stereos , air conditioning . It's all standard with us . __eou__ Good . I am here visiting my girlfriend . I want her to have a good time . __eou__ Oh , is that so ? Well , then . Let me show you something she might like . It's on our back lot . __eou__ This is a Porsche ! __eou__ Yes . Beautiful , isn't it ? __eou__ But I probably can't afford it . It must be really expensive . __eou__ Well , sir . You said you were looking at cars at the rental agency at the airport.Now with them you'd spend your money and get nothing for it.But you could probably rent this Porsche from us , for the same price as one of their standard cars . __eou__ But how can you do that ? __eou__ It's because our prices are so good.And this car has a lot of miles on it . But it's in nice shape , isn't it ? __eou__ Yes , it almost looks new . __eou__
You should have seen the line at the housing office.It took me an hour to make my dormitory deposit for next year . Have you made yours yet ? __eou__ No , I ’ m not sure I ’ m going to . __eou__ Why not ? There ’ s not much time left . Are you short of cash ? __eou__ No , thanks . I am okay . __eou__ You ’ d better hurry up if you wanna a dorm room next September ... __eou__ Well , actually , I am thinking about living off campus . __eou__ Do you have any idea how much that would cost ? __eou__ I know it would be more expensive . I think I could handle it though . It ’ s that this dorm is so noisy that I can ’ t get anything done . __eou__ You should study in the library the way I do . Think of the money you ’ d save . __eou__ I ’ Ve got to think it over some more . __eou__ I hope you will have second thoughts . __eou__
This is how a holiday should be . Relaxing on the beach with a nice cool drink . __eou__ Isn ’ t it wonderful here ? The kids are enjoying themselves in the swimming pool . I hope it ’ s safe . __eou__ Don ’ t worry about them . They ’ re very responsible . Besides , there are many people there and there ’ s lifeguard employed by the hotel . Waiter ! Could I have another drink pleas ? Thank you . So , what shall we do this evening ? __eou__ The kids said that they wanted to go to a party at the hotel . There ’ s a special one just for kids . __eou__ So , we could try that restaurant that was recommended in the guidebook . Then we could go to a club . We haven ’ t been to one for ages . __eou__ That ’ s a great idea . We can really enjoy ourselves without worrying about the kids . __eou__ Now , how about going for a swim in the sea ? We shouldn ’ t sunbathe all day . __eou__
Good morning , doctor . I've been suffering very much from a toothache lately . __eou__ Well , let me have a look . Will you sit down in this chair and open your mouth wide ? __eou__ I think one of the back ones at the top is giving me the most trouble . __eou__ Yes . This big one is badly decayed . I'm afraid it must be taken out . __eou__ Oh , I hate having teeth pulled out . Will it hurt ? __eou__ No need to worry . You won't feel anything at all . I'll give you an injection to stop the pain . Just wash your mouth out with this water , will you ? __eou__ Will it take long ? __eou__ No , it'll be over soon . Nurse , get some X-rays of our patient's molars . Then we'll start . Open your mouth wide . Don't be so nervous . Now open wider ... now stay , that's over ... __eou__ Is it out ? __eou__ Not yet , but it soon will be . Now open again please ... It's out ! Look ! __eou__ Well , really ! That was wonderful ! I felt no pain at all . Thank you , doctor . __eou__
Fred , is it a good time to talk with you ? __eou__ Sure , what's the matter ? __eou__ As you know , I have accepted three new programs in our company this year , but I am not sure I can do my work well . And right now my dilemma is that I can not find a person whom I can trust for these three programs . __eou__ What do you think we can do about this ? __eou__ We are not willing to miss the chance ; however , our staff is not big enough now . So , to be honest , I want you to help me to finish all these programs . __eou__ Well , sir , I am busy in market development . So I am worried whether I can do this . __eou__ I am aware you have been working so hard . Before hiring more employees , you are still needed to do this . __eou__ OK ! I will try this . __eou__
Hi , sir . Come and have a look here . We have all kinds of sweaters . __eou__ I ’ m looking for a sweater for my wife . Tomorrow is her birthday . And I know she needs a woolen sweater . __eou__ How do you like this grey one ? It ’ s pure wool , one hundred percent of Xinjiang wool . __eou__ It feels good . Are there cowl-neck pullovers with the same color ? My wife prefers a turtleneck to a V-shaped collar . __eou__ Yes , we do . What size do you want ? __eou__ Size one . By the way , what if I bring home this sweater and my wife doesn ’ t like it ? __eou__ Well , you can always bring it back to us for a full refund . __eou__ All right . Could I have it gift-wrapped , please ? __eou__ Yes , just a moment , please . __eou__
I only want a little off the top and the sides and back to have clean lines . __eou__ Okay . Is your hair naturally curly or is it a perm ? __eou__ It's natural . My friend told me you know how to work with curls . __eou__ That's my specialty . Let me put this around your neck . __eou__ Do you have any product that controls frizz ? __eou__ With the cut I'll give you , we will minimize a lot of that . __eou__ Thank you ! __eou__ And when we're done , I'll show you some great stuff to take care of the rest . __eou__
You look fresh recently . And .. what's your weight now ? __eou__ 110 pounds . __eou__ Really ? Congratulations ! That's really something beyond my imagination . How did you make it ? Did you keep on a diet ? __eou__ No , you know I can't bear eating less . __eou__ Then do the slim pills take effect on you ? __eou__ I've quit it already . I go to aerobics class everyday instead . __eou__ How's it going on ? __eou__ You see . I've lost my weight in spite of my good appetite . __eou__ I'd better exercise my body too .
